Hydrogeomorphic factors drive differences in otolith morphology in fish from the Nu-Salween River


1. Reconstruction of the mean otolith shape in Schizothorax nukiangensis, based on  Wavelet transformation, differentiated by sampling site.

2. Regression analysis of 493 otolith shapes from Schizothorax nukiangensis in the Nu-Salween River

3. Two-dimensional plot of the multiple factor analysis performed for our whole dataset, including multi-scale environmental indices and otolith morphological characters
