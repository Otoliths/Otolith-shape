TI Dependence of humus pools on the duration of the period of soil
   biological activity
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The equations of the dependence of the pools of organic carbon (t/ha) in the 0-100-cm layer on the duration (days) of the period of biological activity (PBA) in the major soil types are suggested. Humus pools as a function of PBA duration are demonstrated to increase more quickly in humid regions, compared to semiarid and arid ones. In the zones of steppes and dry steppes, humus pools can also be affected by thinned plant cover, soil alkalinity, erosion, and deflation.

TI Effect of microrelief on the spatial variation of humus content in
   soddy-podzolic soil under long-term experimental conditions
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The analysis of variation in the content of organic carbon in the Ap horizon of clay loamy soddy-podzolic soil is performed in a long-term held experiment with fertilizers and herbicides. It is shown that the C-org variation is mainly dependent on microrelief as a microerosion factor. A technique is proposed for calculating the local directions and relative intensities of temporary water-erosion flows. A classification is given for the microrelief forms that determine the increase and decrease in C-org content of soil. A conclusion is made that the natural variation in C-org content is continuously reproduced and is not eliminated by field management procedures.

TI Runoff and soil loss response to vegetation removal in a semiarid
   environment
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID EROSION RESPONSE; COVER; MODEL
AB The removal of vegetation is the main cause of soil degradation in semiarid areas. We hypothesized that the changes in soil properties induced by vegetation removal modified the runoff and soil erosion response in a semiarid area of Spain. To test this, two plots (15 by 5 m) were installed on a 23% slope on a Lithic: Haploxeroll. Vegetation was removed by clipping from one of the plots (Plot D) and the changes in surface runoff and soil loss were compared with an undisturbed control plot (Plot N) from 1989 to 1993. Total runoff was significantly greater in Plot D (48.8 mm) than in Plot N (34.9 mm). Runoff ratios between the disturbed and natural plots increased with time from 1.4:1 in 1990 to 2.5:1 in 1993. Vegetation removal increased the soil losses in Plot D (150.2 g m(-2)) by 127% compared with those in Plot N (66.3 g m(-2)). The annual soil loss ratio between the disturbed and natural plots increased from 1.6:1 in 1989 to 4.2:1 in 1993. The observed increase in surface runoff and soil loss was attributed to a progressive deterioration of soil physical properties in Plot D. Bulk density increased by 8.4% (from 1.55 to 1.68 Mg m(-3)) and a reduction of total organic carbon (from 4.0 to 2.6%) and the percentage of stable aggregates (from 81.6 to 56.3%) were observed. There was no evidence of vegetation recovery, suggesting that reduced vegetal cover might lead to irreversible soil degradation in semiarid areas.

TI Aufeis of the Firth River basin, Northern Yukon Canada: Insights into

SO ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH

DT Article
ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; METHANE; FERMENTATION
AB The 31-km(2) aufeis ice sheet of the upper Firth River holds a wealth of information on groundwater hydrology in periglacial environments. Baseflow recession calculations, corrected for aufeis storage (12% of basin discharge), indicate specific groundwater recharge rates of up to 100 mm yr(-1) (up to 50% of runoff), suggesting a significant proportion of drainage from karst. The upper Firth River aufeis is a composite aufeis, with discrete baseflow contributions from different watersheds. Since the late Pleistocene, annual growth of the aufeis has exerted a strong control on lateral erosion and the local river channel geomorphology.
   Two groundwater recharge processes are distinguished on the basis of carbonate geochemistry and 8(13)C: (1) Methanogenic groundwaters, with C-13(DIC) up to -3.3 parts per thousand, are recharged through saturated soils underlain by permafrost; conditions which support anaerobic consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and produce up to 700 mu g-CH4 L-1 (calculated), and (2) Karst groundwaters, with C-13-depleted DIC, recharged through unsaturated soils and circulate through fissured talik in the carbonate bedrock. Most drainage from the region shows varying contributions of these two groundwaters, although a greater contribution from the methanogenic groundwaters occurs in north-facing watersheds. The 8(13)C values far cryogenic calcite precipitates in the ice indicate that the karst groundwaters are the major contribution to aufeis growth. The combined use of 8(13)C(DIC) and geochemistry may be a useful tool to quantify methanogenesis in northern watersheds.

AB The development of sound management approaches to reduce soil organic carbon (SOC) losses presupposes that we thoroughly understand the sources of these losses. We used a landscape-scale research design to estimate human-induced SOC losses by comparing SOC storage in undisturbed landscapes with comparable landscapes disturbed by clear-cutting of forests in the Mixedwood/Gray Luvisolic zone of central Saskatchewan and by agricultural activity in the Black soil zone. A 14.0% decrease in soil organic carbon storage in the upper 45 cm of the soil (from 57.1 Mg ha(-1) in mature Mixedwood sites to 49.1 Mg ha(-1) in clear-cut landscapes) occurred due to clear cutting at the research sites in the Mixedwood forest. The dominant soil type at these sites, Gray Luvisolic soils developed in glacial till, experienced a 11% loss in SOC storage; higher losses (36% loss) occurred from sandy Brunisolic inclusions in the sites. Changes in SOC storage at the research sites in the Black soil zone landscapes varied with texture and parent material: sandy glacio-fluvial landscapes experienced slight gains of SOC (from 54.1 to 60.1 Mg ha(-1)); silt and clay glacio-lacustrine landscapes experienced a 15.3% decrease in SOC (from 145.2 to 122.9 Mg ha(-1)); and loamy glacial till landscapes underwent a major decrease in SOC storage (from 116.2 to 75.2 Mg ha(-1)). Our results indicate that attempts to increase SOC storage in Saskatchewan soils should concentrate on agricultural landscapes, especially those dominated by glacial till.

AB Good-quality soil is important for crop production sustainability of agricultural lands. An indicator of soil quality is the soil organic carbon (OC) concentration, which affects the soil dry aggregate (DA) and water-stable aggregate (WSA) size distribution. These, in turn, affect the soil quality. This study was conducted to establish relationships among various DA, WSA, and soil OC variables of a Torrertic Paleustoll (Pullman clay loam) using simple, polynomial, and multiple regression procedures. Samples were obtained from a depth of 0-3 cm of 18 differently managed dryland treatment areas or fields at Bushland, Texas, USA, to determine DA and WSA size distributions and OC concentrations of bulk soil. The water stability and OC of aggregates obtained by dry sieving were determined also. Areas sampled ranged from plots or fields cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands converted to cropland in 1994. Of the 110 relationships analyzed, 63 were significant at P less than or equal to 0.05 and another 23 were related at P levels of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40. Variables involving the 0.84 to 2.0 mm DAs often were significantly related to various other DA and WSA variables and to soil OC variables, including a positive relationship with bulk soil OC. The DAs in this size range resist erosion by wind. Because of their significant relationship with WSAs, they are important also for maintaining water infiltration, thereby reducing the potential for erosion by water and increasing the potential for greater soil water storage. Practices such as reduced or no-tillage retain crop residues on the soil surface and thereby maintain or enhance surface soil OC concentrations, which enhance the development of DAs in this size range. By inference, these practices, therefore, are important also for maintaining production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils.

AB Bryophytes and lichens associated with soil crusts were sampled over 500,000 km(2) of rangelands in semi-arid eastern Australia. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to examine the relationships between a range of environmental variables and the distributions of these species from a subset of 130 samples from 87 sites. CCA revealed that bryophytes were related to total annual rainfall, soil pH, calcium carbonate levels, plant cover, texture, organic carbon, and soil texture. Lichens were related to annual rainfall, pH, calcium carbonate levels, plant cover, sheet erosion, organic carbon, and crust cover. Rainfall is a primary determinant of plant cover, which in turn affects light, nutrient availability and litter levels, and therefore bryophyte and lichen distribution. On the basis of the first two ordination axes, bryophytes and lichens clustered infer loose arrangements of species, based on their responses to the environmental variables.

AB Surface crusting results from aggregate breakdown under raindrop impact. It reduces the infiltration rate and may induce erosion by increasing runoff, Soil crustability and erodibility generally increase as organic carbon content decreases. Samples of topsoil were collected from fields cropped continuously for maize after land clearance at various dates. Organic carbon content ranged 4-30 g kg(-1). Aggregate stability was assessed by measuring fragment size distribution Samples were also subjected to simulated rainfall. The size of fragments forming the seal when the rain ceased and the infiltration rate during the rainfall were measured to characterize seal structure and hydraulic properties, Development of the seal and infiltration capacity were related to aggregate stability, which was itself a function of organic carbon content. The relations between aggregate breakdown, crusting and infiltration enabled us to predict soil physical behaviour from measurements of aggregate stability which are easier to make than direct measurements under rainfall. The proposed tests offer the opportunity to evaluate actual or potential soil physical degradation and erosion risks without extensive field measurements.

AB Runoff and sediment yield were evaluated on a sandplain dominated by woody perennial shrubs in north-western NSW, Australia, The site was bladeploughed; and some plots were grazed by sheep and cattle and others exclosed from grazing, Two years after ploughing and exclosure, grazed plots had significantly lower levels of aggregate stability and organic carbon compared with ungrazed plots, but there was no effect of ploughing, Surface pH levels were significantly greater on unploughed plots compared with ploughed plots, Two years after treatment, runoff and sediment yield were greatest on plots with the least disturbance (unploughed and ungrazed) and least on sites with the greatest disturbance (ploughed and grazed), We attribute differences in soil hydrology to the development of a thin physical soil crust on the unploughed-ungrazed plots, which restricted infiltration, On the ungrazed plots, increases in plant cover and biomass, and colonisation of the physical crust by biological elements, are hypothesised to lead to reduced runoff and sediment yield over time.

AB The soil under intensive cultivation and low addition of crop residues is exposed to erosion and reduction of organic matter. Increases in soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and nutrient availability may occur in no-till systems with legumes and with large additions of organic residues. Nevertheless, some legumes may increase soil acidification through the carbon and nitrogen cycles. An experiment was carried out over 10 years, with 10 cropping systems on a Dark Red Podzolic soil (Paleudult) to evaluate the effect of no-till cropping systems on soil chemical characteristics. Legume cropping systems resulted in the greatest soil organic C gain and the highest ECEC to a depth of 17.5 cm. The increase was greatest at 0 - 2.5 cm layer. Clover systems resulted in the highest soil acidification at 2.5 - 7.5 and 7.5 - 17.5 cm depths. The rate of soil pH decrease at 2.5 - 7.5 cm depth under clover+ Spergula/maize system was 0.1 unit year(-1). Differences in soil acidification affected soil ECEC. Soil exchangeable cation data indicate that nitrate leaching increased soil acidification. Maize yields were greatest in legume systems due to increased N supply.

AB Analyses of phytoliths and carbon isotopes document change in late Quaternary grasslands in the Red Valley of the southern Black Hills. Late Pleistocene grassland composition was equivalent to the C-3 grass parklands of modern central Alberta. The rise of mixed grassland occurred rapidly between 11,000 and 9000 yr B.P. Early Holocene mixed grasslands included both short and tall C-4 grasses. A mid-Holocene erosional unconformity (ca. 8000 to 4500 yr B.P.) precludes phytolith or isotope analysis, but suggests lack of vegetation and landscape denudation caused by a drier climatic. Basin-wide stability and soil development followed the erosional episode (ca. 4500 to 3600 yr B.P.). Mesic-adapted C-4 panicoid grasses increased during this period of soil development. Low-magnitude fluctuation in the C-4-dominated mixed grassland occurred throughout the late Holocene (3600 yr B.P. to present). Rise in delta(13)C values during the last 1000 yr without corresponding change in phytoliths may indicate a decrease in woodlands caused by increased fire frequency.

AB Sediment enrichment and transport from a highly weathered, well-aggregated, and uniformly-textured soil were determined using field rainfall simulation. Overland flow on an agriculturally managed ridge-and-furrow system was generated by applying four successive rainfall events: a dry run on bare soil with a rainfall intensity of 35 mm h(-1), a wet run on bare soil with the same rainfall intensity, a very wet run on bare soil with a rainfall intensity of 62 mm h-1, and a final run on partially plastic-mulched soil (to simulate pineapple culture) with a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h(-1). Stream power and shear stress of overland flow during the dry and wet runs did not exceed the critical level for rill flow detachment. and resulted in runoff sediment concentrations between 1.7-3.5 g L(-1), with 70-90% of sediment consisting of fine aggregates (< 0.063 mm). As flow rate and flow stream power and shear stress increased, sediment concentration increased to over 12 g L(-1) for the subsequent two runs. Elevated sediment concentration was associated with increased transport of sand-sized aggregates. Elimination of interrill erosion by plastic mulching reduced transport of fine aggregates in comparison with the bare soil. Due to the high clay content and uniform texture of the Oxisol, sediment from the four events displayed similar primary particle size distribution and no enrichment of clay particles. However, organic carbon (OC) and extractable phosphorus (Ext-P) were enriched in sediment. The magnitudes of enrichment ratio followed the order: dry run (1.2 for OC and 1.4 for Ext-P)> wet run (1.1 for OC and 1.2 for Ext-P)> very wet run(1.03 for OC and 1.1 for Ext-P), plastic mulch run (close to 1 for both OC and Ext-P). This enrichment was associated with selective transport of fine aggregates which were chemically richer than the coarser ones.

AB In 21 derelict soils from a semi-arid Spanish Mediterranean area, with a lithological substrate of loams, submitted to a high degree of erosion, several biological and biochemical properties indicative of the soil degradation level were determined. The organic matter content of these soils was very low (mean value = 11.8 g kg(-1)), approximately one-third of the average value for organic matter content of natural soils in the same zone. Biological properties such as basal respiration and biomass C also had low values and were positively correlated with the organic matter content. Low values for dehydrogenase and catalase activity were indicative of low biological activity of the degraded soils. A positive correlation was found between the hydrolases related with the N, P, C and S cycles (urease, proteases, beta-glucosidase and arylsulphatase), as well as between these hydrolases and the organic matter content. Principal component analysis showed that all the variables studied, except catalase and qCO(2), had a similar behaviour. There was a negative correlation between many of the properties studied and electrical conductivity, which agreed with the higher degree of biological and biochemical degradation found in gypsiferous soils with a higher salt content. Arylsulphatase and beta-glucosidase activity were the hydrolases most affected by soil erosion processes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The condensation of gaseous water and its precipitation from the atmosphere in the form of hydrometeors (e.g., fog, rain, snow, sleet) are important processes not only for the global water budget, but also because they bring to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems other atmospheric species. Not only compounds that have a high affinity toward atmospheric water droplets or soluble aerosol particles are transported, but so are those that are hydrophobic or attracted toward insoluble particulate matter [1]. Nutrients (P, N, C, S), anthropogenically mobilized acids (H2SO4, HNO3), trace elements (Pb, Cd, Cu, As), carbonaceous particulate matter (soot components, secondary organic aerosol), and industrially synthesized and combustion-derived organic contaminants (polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated agrochemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are several examples of species that can be removed from the atmosphere during precipitation events and deposited to the ground or water surfaces. Sources of these compounds include point sources (i.e., fossil fuel combustion products from power generation plants, non-ferrous smelting), area sources (i.e., volatilization from land fills and soils, soil erosion, drift from agrichemical applications, biomass burning), and mobile sources (i.e., motor vehicles). Once released into the atmosphere, contaminants may be partitioned between gaseous and particulate phases. Cloud and precipitation droplets may incorporate both gases and aerosol particles. In this chapter, the uptake and removal mechanisms are discussed together with the speciation of contaminants that they control. Wet deposition is the result of dynamic processes linked with microphysical and chemical processes. While dynamic processes are responsible for the removal of water, gases, and aerosol particles from the troposphere, microphysical processes that occur prior to or during cloud and rain droplet formation, such as gas-particle and gas-water partitioning, condensation, and coalescence, largely control the ground-level concentrations of atmospheric species in precipitation. The incorporation of aerosol particles into precipitation droplets, and the role which particle size plays, is relatively poorly understood yet plays an especially important role in the persistence and removal of airborne contaminants.

AB This paper reports the effects of 6 wheat-annual pasture rotations over 18 years on soil N, organic C, P, and pH in a red earth soil at Wagga Wagga (35 degrees 03'S, 147 degrees 21'E), in southern NSW. There were 3 cropping intensities (33, 50, 67%) with pastures dominated by subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L. cv. Bacchus Marsh) and annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud. cv. Wimmera). Rotations were long (6-year) or short (2- or 3-year).
   Initial soil N and organic C concentrations (0-10 cm) were low, 1300-1400 kg N/ha and 0.7-0.9 g organic C/100 g. The rate of increase of total N in the top 20 cm was the same on short and long rotations, and increased with the proportion of pasture in the rotation from 2.0 to 12.1 to 20.7 kg N/ha.year for pasture to crop ratios of 0.33, 0.50, and 0.67. Estimates of the amounts of N fixed and the measured accumulation of N per pasture year varied within the narrow ranges of 95-113 and 45-64 kg N/ha.pasture year. Organic C increased faster as the proportion of pasture in the rotation increased and there was no evidence that steady-state concentrations were achieved by Year 18.
   Estimates of the average amount of N leached below 30 cm varied in the range 22-29 kg N/ha.year. Analysis of the individual crop and pasture effects on soil N in the surface 10 cm indicated that net nitrate leaching was greatest in the second pasture year or in the first crop year following 1 year of pasture. A significant amount of N leached during the first 2 or 3 pasture years in a rotation was recovered by the first wheat crop or by the third and fourth year pastures. Second to fourth cereal crops depleted soil N by an amount similar to that removed in the grain. Average grain N% for the rotation treatments was closely described (R-2 = 0.96) as a function of the length of the pasture phase, the pasture to crop ratio, and the interaction pasture to crop ratio x number of preceding wheat crops.
   In the top 30 cm the pH changed at a rate near -0.04 units/year on all treatments, equivalent to addition of 2.3-2.8 kmol H+/ha.year. The acid addition rate, and hence the long-term lime requirement (50 kg lime/kmol H+), did not vary with pasture to crop ratio or with the length of the rotation. The proportion of the acid added to the top 30 cm of soil that was contributed from the N cycle (nitrification followed by nitrate loss by leaching below 30 cm or by run-off) was 0.65 for rotations with 67% pasture and 0.80 for rotations with 33% pasture. Carbon cycle acids, produced during organic matter accumulation and the synthesis of products that were subsequently removed, accounted for the remainder.
   Individual crop and pasture effects on soil pH were near the overall mean of -0.04 units except in years preceding and following the transition from pasture to cereal phases of the rotations. In cereal-dominated rotations the last pasture year was strongly acid (pH decrease 0.13-0.17) and the following cereal year was alkaline (pH increase 0.05-0.08). In pasture-dominated rotations the effects were reversed, the last pasture being alkaline (pH increase 0.07-0.12) and the following cereal being acid (pH decrease 0.13-0.19). In the 50% rotations, effects were intermediate.
   Organic and inorganic forms of soil P in the surface 10 cm increased linearly with time, accounting for 38% of the applied fertiliser P. Of the applied P, 88% was accounted for by the sum of P accumulated in the surface 20 cm of soil and by removal in products and waste products. The remainder may have been lost by erosion or accumulated in forms resistant to extraction by 0.1 M H2SO4 after ignition at 550 degrees C. There was a slightly greater rate of increase of organic P as the proportion of pasture in the rotation increased. The annual addition of 11.8 kg P/ha.year marginally exceeded the amount required to maintain the available P concentration.

TI Soil erosion and nutrient loss .3. Changes in the enrichment ratio of
   total nitrogen and organic carbon under rainfall detachment and
   entrainment
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SEDIMENT
AB Experiments to investigate the enrichment mechanisms of organic carbon, nitrogen, and fine particles in eroded sediment were carried out on 2 contrasting soils under simulated rainfall with and without runon. Sediment samples for concentration measurement were collected at different sampling intervals and fractionated into various size fractions using sets of sieves. The fractionated sediment samples and original (uneroded samples) were analysed for total nitrogen and organic carbon to obtain the enrichment ratio (E-R) for both elements.
   For both soils, sediment concentration, total nitrogen and organic carbon (E-R), and concentration ratios of nitrogen and organic carbon changed considerably under the different dominant erosion mechanisms in the experiments. For experiments on both 0.1 and 3% slopes, sediment concentrations of the smaller fractions (<53 and 53-500 mu m) were higher than those of the original soil and remained so throughout the duration of the experiment. At the higher slope (3%) and thus lower water depths, a process described as raindrop peeling apparently was more pronounced, since stable soil aggregates were exposed to raindrop impact. The concentration of the smaller size fraction increases with time resulting in an increase in total nitrogen and organic carbon relative to the original soil. This leads to an E-R greater than unity in the eroded sediment.
   Rilling was observed in experiments with both rainfall and runon. During the relatively short period prior to the establishment of active rilling, the proportion of larger aggregates increased with time. After this proportion had stabilised, the concentrations of total nitrogen and organic carbon were similar to those in the original soil. Thus, E-R was close to unity, sometimes being slightly below unity.
   The presence of significant depths of water greatly influenced both the breakdown of soil aggregates and the size or settling velocity distribution of the eroded sediment. In these circumstances, the size-selected process of deposition can lead to enrichment. With a negligible depth of water on the soil surface, raindrop peeling was the dominant mechanism, producing fine particles richer in organic carbon and total nitrogen than the original soil. As depth of water increases, the effect of the highly varied settling velocity particles on the size characteristics of eroded sediment becomes more evident, and the effect of raindrop stripping diminishes. With a thin layer of water on its surface, both of these mechanisms seem to be operative.

AB Change in soil infiltration characteristics with cultivation can result in reduced soil water storage, increased runoff and erosion, and reduced crop production. We measured changes in infiltration characteristics associated with years of cultivation for 5 soil groups in south-eastern Queensland. Soils were grouped according to soil type and texture into Sodosols, light and heavy Vertosols, Red Ferrosols, and Red Chromosols/Kandosols. Soil infiltration characteristics were determined from measurements of permeability and water-holding properties of the cultivated layer (0-0.1m deep) and the layer immediately below the plough layer (0.1-0.2 m deep). A rainfall simulator was used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of surface seals and infiltration of bare, tilled soil in the field. Hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix and macropores and water-holding properties of the 0.1-0.2 m layer were measured with disc permeameters and pressure plate apparatus. Hydraulic conductivity of surface seals decreased exponentially in all soil groups with period of cultivation; half of the decline occurred within 2-6 years of first cultivation. Hydraulic conductivity, macroporosity, and moisture characteristic of the 0.1-0.2 m layer were similarly affected by longer periods of cultivation in all but light-textured soils. Cultivation of light-textured, hardsetting soils (18% clay) did not adversely affect hydraulic conductivity or macroporosity of the 0.1-0.2 m layer and the loosening effect of tillage was somewhat beneficial for the water-holding properties of this layer. The low hydraulic conductivities of the surface or 0.1-0.2 m layer after long periods of cultivation reduced infiltration of rainfall in the field.

AB Chaillexon lake (Doubs, France) has been settled by a rock collapse about 12,000 years ago. That trap represents a continuous sedimentary record for the late and post-glacial period. The optical analysis of the organic matter settled in the Meso-Cenozoic substratum of the watershed and in the sedimentary infilling points out the incorporation of Meso-Cenozoic organic matter in the late and post-glacial organic detrital supply. This incorporation mainly occurred from late glacial to Preboreal periods (12,000-9,000 B.P.) showing that during this time vegetal and soil covers were poorly developed and did not allow a significant protection of the bedrock from erosional processes. This protection started only at the beginning of Boreal (9 000 B.P.).
   These results and besides the presence of Meso-Cenozoic organic matter mainly composed with opaque particles (coal debris) allow us two remarks: - such particles found in recent sediments must not be systematically interpreted as fire signals, - a watershed without any vegetal cover can nevertheless provide organic carbon.

AB Soils from many portions of the Mediterranean region are subjected to progressive degradation as a result of erosion by wind and water. As a consequence, the fertility level of these degraded soils is declining. This report studied the dehydrogenase activity of 18 soils, all of which-were subjected to processes of erosion, in order to ascertain whether such activity could serve as a marker of the microbial activity of a degraded soil. The dehydrogenase activity of the soils studied was not correlated with their organic matter content, indicating that total organic matter was not representative of the microbial activity of degraded soil. An analysis of principal components showed a similar behavior between other indices of microbial activity (basal respiration and biomass carbon) and the dehydrogenase activity values. This data confirmed that dehydrogenase activity can be used as a sensitive marker of soil degradation and soil microbial activity.

AB Because of erosion problems, an effort has been undertaken to evaluate the effect of tillage intensity on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling on a vertisol. Soil samples at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth were collected from a split plot experiment with five different levels of tillage intensity on Houston Black soil (fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellusterts). The experiment was a split plot design with 5 replications. The main plots were chisel tillage, reduced tillage, row tillage, strip tillage, and no tillage. The subplots were soil fertility levels with either high or low fertilizer application rate. Total N, total phosphorus (P), organic C, inorganic N, and C:N ratio were measured on soil samples as well as the potential C mineralization, N mineralization, C turnover, and C:N mineralization ratio during a 30 d incubation. Total P and organic C in soil were increased, with 0.9 and 0.8 kg P ha(-1) and 20.6 and 20.0 kg C ha(-1), for high and low soil fertility, respectively. Fertilizer application had no effect on either total N at the 0-10 cm depth, or on soil nutrient status below 10 cm. Potential soil N mineralization was decreased at the 0-10 cm depth and increased at the 20-30 cm depth by the high fertilizer treatment. Chisel tillage decreased total N and P in the 0-10 cm depth, with 1.4 and 1.6 kg N ha(-1) and 0.8 and 0.9 kg P ha(-1). However, chisel tillage increased total N and p at the 10-20 cm depth, with 1.3 and 1.2 kg N ha(-1), and 0.72 and 0.66 kg P ha(-1) for chisel tillage and no tillage, respectively. Tillage intensity increased C mineralization and C turnover, but reduced N mineralization at the 0-10 cm depth. The results indicate that intensively tilled soil had a greater capacity for C mineralization and for reductions in soil organic C levels compared to less intensively tilled systems.

AB The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of rainfall intensity and soil texture on the transport behavior of three pesticides (2,4-D, metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos). We compared water, sediment, and pesticide losses from two soils (Greenville sandy day loam from Georgia, USA, and a silt loam from Austria), and for two simulated rainfall intensities (40 and 60 mm.h.(-1)) under laboratory conditions. Pesticides were applied to air dry soils at rates of 1.0, 2.0, and 1.5 kg.ha.(-1) for 2,4-D, metolachlor and chlorpyrifos, respectively. One day after pesticide application, erosion pan was placed at a 7.5% slope and rainfall was simulated. Runoff, wash, splash, and infiltration were measured at 5 min intervals throughout the rainfall event. Pesticide concentrations were determined in selected runoff, splash water and infiltration samples, and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Depending on soil texture, time until steady-state runoff was reached varied. Higher silt content of Pyhra soil led to surface sealing, increased runoff, and high splash water rates. Interrill erosion from Pyhra soil was high for air dry surface and decreased when soil surface was sealed or crusted. 2,4-D losses by runoff were higher for Greenville soil with lower organic carbon and lower susceptibility to raindrop detachment. Metolachlor and 2,4-D showed similar transport behaviour. Transport of chlorpyrifos was small.

AB World soils represent the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon (C), about 1550 Pg compared with about 700 Pg in the atmosphere and 600 Pg in land biota. Agricultural activities (e.g., deforestation, burning, plowing, intensive grazing) contribute considerably to the atmospheric pool. Expansion of agriculture may have contributed substantially to the atmospheric carbon pool. However, the exact magnitude of carbon fluxes from soil to the atmosphere and from land biota to the soil are not known. An important objective of the sustainable management of soil resources is to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by increasing passive or non-labile fraction. Soil surface management, soil water conservation and management, and soil fertility regulation are all important aspects of carbon sequestration in soil. Conservation tillage, a generic term implying all tillage methods that reduce runoff and soil erosion in comparison with plow-based tillage, is known to increase SOC content of the surface layer. Principal mechanisms of carbon sequestration with conservation tillage are increase in micro-aggregation and deep placement of SOC in the sub-soil horizons. Other useful agricultural practices associated with conservation tillage are those that increase biomass production (e.g., soil fertility enhancement, improved crops and species, cover crops and fallowing, improved pastures and deep-rooted crops). It is also relevant to adopt soil and crop management systems that accentuate humification and increase the passive fraction of SOC. Because of the importance of C sequestration, soil quality should be evaluated in terms of its SOC content.

AB Ozark forest soils are dynamic in space and time, and most formed in multiple parent materials. Erosion and mass movement have been variable and extensive. Soil attributes including texture, cation exchange capacity, and mineralogy are related to geologic strata and to geomorphic conditions. Soil organic carbon content is influenced by surface shape, position in landscape, and aspect. Phosphorus is universally low, and most P is occluded, Many soil attributes are distributed in patterns related to topographic, geologic, and geomorphic features, but the patterns often are masked by site-specific variability such as tree throw, micro-relief, and slumps. Generalizations about Ozark soil landscapes must be given cautiously and are most meaningful in the context of attribute ranges rather than means.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Microbial biomass and activity of tropical and temperate soils from Brazil and England, respectively, were measured during 150 days incubation at 15 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Extractable carbon was determined by the fumigation-extraction method giving initial biomass values ranges from 160-600 mu g C.g(-1) soil for tropical soils and from 400-1300 mu g C.g(-1) soil for temperate soils. It was evident from all soils (except a tropical one) that biomass at 35 degrees C decreased more, over a long incubation period, than at 15 degrees C; the temperate soils had the highest decrease at 35 degrees C. Death rate of biomass quotient (go) calculated over the 150 days period of incubation showed that tropical and temperate soils, at 15 degrees C, have similar values, but at 35 degrees C temperate soils had higher rates than tropical soils, confirming the existence of some sensitivity of temperate soils to elevated temperature. Carbon from carbon dioxide (CO2-C) was also measured for all soils investigated. There was a greater respiration rate at 35 degrees C than at 15 degrees C for all the soils. The temperate soils showed faster mineralization rate than the tropical, mainly at 35 degrees C. At this temperature the amounts of CO2-C respired were from 2 to 9 times as much carbon as was present in the original biomass, indicating that this carbon could only have come from the soil organic matter. Biomass specific respiration rate (mg CO2-C evolved.g(-1) biomass.day(-1)) showed greater values for temperate soils at both temperatures, at 15 degrees C the rate was 2.7 times greater and at 35 degrees C the rate was 2.4 times greater. These results suggest that there is more available energy, in the temperate soils than in the tropical soils, reinforcing that there is more carbon stored in microbial biomass of temperate soils. Comments are made on a possible contributionof microorganisms, mainly of temperate soils, to global warming, in case of a global atmospheric temperature elevation. However, it is important to consider other factors inherent to soil characteristics (i.e. organic matter added to soil, its plant cover, soil erosion, deforestation and climatic changes) as possibly stronger causes of global warming.

ID YIELD; MODEL
AB Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally. The EPIC (Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator) model was used to examine the sensitivity of soil erosion (wind, water) and soil organic carbon (SOC) (15 cm and 1 m depth) across the US corn belt to changes in temperature (+2 degrees C), precipitation (+/-10%, +/-20%), wind speed (+/-10%, +/-20%), and atmospheric CO2 concentration (350, 625 ppmv). One-hundred-year simulations were run for each of 100 sites under 36 climate/CO2 regimes. The 100-year regionally aggregated mean water erosion rates increased linearly with precipitation, whereas the wind erosion rates decreased and total erosion rates increased by 15-18%. Total erosion increased with increased temperature. Increasing CO2 from 350 to 625 ppmv (with temperature increased by 2 degrees C and mean wind speed held constant) had no effect on water erosion, despite increases in annual total and peak runoff; this was attributed to increased vegetation cover. Wind erosion decreased by 4-11% under increased CO2. Wind erosion was very sensitive to mean wind speed, increasing four-fold and decreasing 10-fold for a 20% increase or decrease in mean wind speed, respectively. This was attributed to a threshold effect. SOC to 1 m decreased 4.8 Mg-C ha(-1) from an initial value of 18.1 Mg-C ha(-1) during the 100-year baseline simulation. About 50% of this loss (2.3 Mg-C ha(-1)) was due to transport off-site by soil erosion. SOC in the top 15 cm decreased 0.8 Mg-C ha(-1) from an initial value of 4.9 Mg-C ha(-1). Increased temperature and precipitation accelerated these losses of SOC, whereas increased CO2 slowed the losses. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd

AB This study addresses the temporal distribution of forms of phosphorus in the soil of a temporarily flooded riparian forest of the valley of the river Garonne (Southwest of France). A sequential extraction for forms of phosphorus of increasing chemical stability was used. During the study period (13 months), the forest was flooded a few days during March and May. In winter, resin-Pi concentration was high (26 mu g g(-1)) in comparison to spring values (<9 mu g g(-1)). NaHCO3-Po, NaHCO3-Pi or NaOH-Pi concentrations increased during winter (up to 74, 124 and 78 mu g g(-1) respectively) and decreased significantly during spring (32, 44 and 32 mu g g(-1) respectively). This pattern was attributed to simultaneous mineralization and plant uptake during the growing season and to the flood events (erosional processes and P-release). During summer and fall, resin-Pi concentration increased significantly (up to 26 mu g g(-1) in October). NaHCO3-Po concentrations remained low during spring and summer (<33 mu g g(-1)), and increased significantly in fall (>45 mu g g(-1)). NaHCO3-Pi or NaOH-Pi increased in late spring or summer (90 mu g g(-1) and 68 mu g g(-1) respectively). Increasing concentrations of the labile forms during late spring or summer were ascribed to the warm temperature and soil dryness that limited plant growth. HCl-Pi increased regularly after the floods (174 mu g g(-1) before the flood events to 254 mu g g(-1) after the floods). Residual P presented a similar pattern i.e. 214 mu g g(-1) and 279 mu g g(-1) respectively before and after the flood events. This pattern was attributed to a progressive incorporation of flood deposits to the soil.

AB Rainsplash is an important component of interrill erosion. To date, few studies have critically examined the linkages between aggregate entrainment by splash and associated nutrient flux. An Oxisol was used in laboratory rainfall experiments with two different antecedent moisture contents (AMC) and ten different rainfall energy flux densities (EFD). Splash and soil organic carbon (SOC) flux increased with increased EFD regardless of initial AMC. Aggregates were not transported in proportion to their content in the original soil matrix, those of 2000-4000 mu m and < 105 mu m were found to be the most resistant to splash. Energy required to detach 1 gC varied from a median of 1870 J for the 2000-4000 mu m fraction to 120 J for the 425-850 mu m fraction. Temporal variation in cumulative splash flux and carbon flux for various combinations of AMC and EFD indicated distinct patterns. Under dry AMC, splash increased during 1 h duration storms and this was explained by increased aggregate breakdown by air-slaking, decreased soil strength and increased erodibility as soil moisture increased. Wet soil runs exhibited the opposite pattern of decreased flux with time, probably indicating a complex response to limited aggregate availability, increased seal development by raindrop compaction, and transient water layer effects in drop impact craters. The formulation of mass-based SOC enrichment ratios CER) clearly indicated preferential detachment and transport of splashed aggregates between 250 and 2000 mu m. A reliance of chemical transport models on concentration-based ER values can be misleading, because it is the balance between nutrient concentration and sediment quantity that is important for soil quality and non-point source modelling.

AB We examined soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in a shortgrass steppe ecosystem along spatial gradients in plant inputs and temporal gradients in disturbance age because a better understanding of decay characteristics of SOM pools may improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses ra perturbation. We assessed measurable pools of SOM that are thought to correspond to active, intermediate, and passive SOM based upon turnover characteristics in three separate experiments. In a first, we evaluated SOM pools along a spatial gradient in plant inputs, from locations under individual bunch grasses to natural areas of plant removal (ant mounds). In a second experiment we assessed SOM pools across a temporal gradient in ant mounds ranging from approximate to 5 to 60 yr old. Finally, we compared our results from the second experiment to a single human-induced plant-removal experiment.
   We found that reduced root biomass accounted for up to 90% of the variation in SOM across our spatial gradients. In our examination of temporal dynamics of SOM, we found that locations with little or no plant inputs for approximate to 45 yr had 28% less total soil C than in native areas with average plant cover. We measured the greatest proportional losses (48-78%) of SOM in response to reduced plant inputs (over 30-60 yr) in the active SOM as indexed by C and N mineralization and microbial biomass C and N. The range of losses from intermediate organic matter as indexed by particulate organic matter (POM) ranged from 38 to 73%, and losses from the passive pool were proportionately lower (57%). Though this general pattern follows the course predicted by theory, and our measurements of turnover of intermediate SOM agree closely with models, results indicate a considerably slower turnover rate for the active pool and a considerably faster rate for the passive pool than expected. We compared our field estimates of plant-removal-induced SOM losses to simulation modeling results and cultivation studies. Our comparison of field results to Century model simulations indicated a possible model overestimation of the impact of plant removal on SOM loss. By comparing our plant-removal results to studies of cultivation-induced losses of SOM on the shortgrass steppe, we found that plant-removal is not as severe a disturbance as cropping, likely as a result of physical disturbances associated with tillage such as surface erosion and disturbance of soil aggregate structure.

ID SOIL
AB Bench-terracing and Pinus afforestation have been extensively adopted as a means of soil conservation in Spain. This paper questions the appropriateness of this technology to extensively gullied soils and sediments of the Rana formation of central Spain. Bench-terracing has markedly altered the characteristics of the surface soil horizon as compared with nearby undisturbed matorral (natural scrub) vegetation. The construction process and resultant bench-terrace morphology have imposed a new, more spatially structured pattern in soil properties giving enhanced opportunities for overland flow generation and erosion. The terracing has exposed subsurface Bt horizons on inner treads and lower risers, producing a very compact clay rich surface horizon, low in organic carbon and of poor structural stability. Despite subsoiling hydraulic conductivity is very low. Excavated soil material is ploughed sideways to partially bury the original surface horizon and form part of the next riser downslope. Downslope drainage on the terraces gives rise to soil moisture contents approaching saturation on the lower risers and treads. Consequently only small rainfall inputs are required to initiate pending and overland flow generation on sloping treads. Rainfall simulation demonstrates the importance of antecedent soil moisture to runoff generation, and the role of vegetation and organic matter in retaining water. Erosion bridge measurements show that erosion rates on sloping treads are as high as those recorded on gully sidewalls. Gully sidewall erosion is also accelerated by runoff waters shed from terrace treads. Management of native matorral vegetation may provide a more sustainable approach to soil conservation than bench terracing with afforestation.

AB High concentrations of N, P, and organic C in water cause problems such as excessive eutrophication in reservoirs and bacterial growth in distribution systems. The aim of this study was to measure the export of N, P, and organic C in streams draining two grazed catchments with no point sources in the Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia, during 1 yr. Retreat Valley catchment (1.3 km(2)) is grazed by sheep, has steep topography, and loam over clay soils. Lawless catchment (3.0 km(2)) is Batter, grazed by dairy cattle, and has sand over clay soils. Rainfall and specific runoff were similar. Annual exports were 924 kg suspended solids ha(-1), 9.0 kg N ha(-1), 1.0 kg P ha(-1), and 55 kg organic C ha(-1) from Retreat Valley; and 40 kg suspended solids ha(-1), 6.6 kg N ha(-1), 1.1 kg P ha(-1), and 66 kg organic C ha(-1) from Lawless. In Retreat Valley, 33% of the N, 86% of the P, and 65% of the organic C was in particulate forms resulting from erosion; and 45% of the N was nitrate. In Lawless, 82% of the N, 76% of the P, and 92% of the organic C was dissolved. Of the dissolved N, approximately 93% was organic. Concentrations of P in both streams, and dissolved organic C in Lawless, exceeded desirable limits. A combination of management options, including management of grazing and fertilizer application, soil amendment, and subsurface drainage, could lead to reductions in nutrient exports.

AB Soil erosion has been shown to result in decreased crop yields and reduced agricultural sustainability (Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station Technical Bulletin, 1989; Littleboy et al., 1992; and Craft et al., 1992). To address the problems associated with soil erosion, Congress passed the Food Security Act in 1985. To comply with this law, farmers must implement conservation plans on highly erodible land to ''significantly reduce'' erosion rates.
   One widely used method of soil conservation is no-tillage agriculture. But water runoff is reduced under conservation tillage and infiltration increases, possibly resulting in more pesticide movement through the unsaturated zone into the groundwater (Gish et al., 1991 and Donigian and Carsel, 1987). Most research suggests that pesticide sorption to soil is primarily a function of pesticide partitioning into the soil organic matter rather than adsorption into the total soil mass (Karickoff et al., 1979). The addition of commercially composted yard waste when mixed with soil to increase the organic carbon content and adding to soil surface to reduce erosion and water runoff may reduce pesticide loading to groundwater compared to no-till.
   Surface applied organic mulches in general have been shown to reduce soil erosion (Adams, 1966; Kramer and Meyer, 1969; and Vleeschauwer et al., 1978). Yard waste compost in particular has been shown to reduce erosion when surface applied (Ettlin and Stewart, 1993). Since beneficial uses are needed for yard waste compost (BioCycle Guide to Yard Waste Composting, 1989a and 1989b), adding compost to high value horticultural fields should provide a beneficial use for an ever increasing waste product.
   Research comparing pesticide runoff in no-till versus conventional-till have been mixed. Kenimer et al. (1987) concluded that no-till may reduce pesticide loading to surface water while Sauer and Daniel (1987) reported no significant differences. Both reported that any reduction in pesticide runoff is due to reduced water runoff (pesticide runoff concentration was found to be larger in no-till). A compost amended soil should also show the benefit of reduced runoff compared to conventional-till and may show reduced pesticide runoff concentration compared to no-till due to pesticide sorption to organic carbon.
   Metribuzin [4-amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-(methylthio)-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one] has the potential to be transported into the environment(USEPA, 1992, exhibit 4-1 and USEPA, 1985) and it is used to control broadleaf weeds in tomato production (University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service, 1992). The use of yard waste compost to reduce erosion will be beneficial in horticulture due to the value and scale of production.
   The objectives of this research were to study the influence of three soil treatments: 1) yard waste compost amended soil with compost added to soil surface after rototilling, CA; 2) no-till, NT and; 3) conventional-till, CT on metribuzin concentration and loading to surface water via runoff and in sediment

AB Crop residue management is a key consideration when attempting to optimize fertility in conservation tillage systems. Major factors affecting the impact of crop residues on nutrient availability include the chemical composition of the residue [e.g. carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio], residue placement, fertilizer placement in relation to residue and time. Greater surface accumulation of crop residues in reduced and no-till systems tends to slow decomposition of N-poor residues such as cereal straw, and crop N supply during the current year can be reduced by immobilization if the straw is incorporated close to the time of high crop demand. Similarly, placement of fertilizer directly in the surface straw residue can reduce fertilizer use efficiency due to greater immobilization. Greater immobilization in reduced and no-till systems can enhance the conservation of soil and fertilizer N in the long term, with higher initial N fertilizer requirements decreasing over time because of 1) reduced losses by erosion and 2) the build-up of a larger poor of readily mineralizable organic N. For N-rich residues, such as legumes, volatilization losses may be greater when these residues are left on the surface than when incorporated into soil. Leaching of soluble phosphorus and sulfur compounds from standing and surface-placed crop residues into the mineral soil below may be a significant pathway for recycling of these elements in no-till systems. Greater coverage of the soil surface by crop residues can increase soil moisture and affect soil biological activity related to nutrient turnover. Future research should address how above and below-ground decomposition processes differ for a wider range of crop residues and nutrients, emphasizing both short and long-term nutrient recycling.

AB Soil conservation and sustainability concerns, and a lack of markets for crop residues, have left producers with few alternatives for cereal residue export beyond cattle feed or livestock bedding. With the increasing producer use of minimum and zero-tillage systems, the management of crop residues has become an important issue. Opportunities for residue removal may exist provided markets are developed for the material and long-term soil sustainability concerns are addressed.
   Recent research on the effect-of residue removal in Saskatchewan has shown that there is little or no impact on soil organic matter provided adequate fertilization is practised and tillage is reduced. Assuming that 750 kg ha(-1) of retained residue is adequate for erosion protection in reduced tillage systems, significant quantities of residues may be available for export from the Black Soil zone. The economic returns to producers are such that residue export is an attractive diversification option.

AB We used palaeolimnological techniques to examine effects of Holocene climate change and human influence on lakes of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The three study lakes are located along a west-east transect that represents a gradient of increasing modern precipitation and density of former Maya settlement. At Lake Coba, an 880-cm sediment core yields a complete record of lacustrine sedimentation that began when the lake first filled similar to 8000 BP as groundwater level rose in response to rising sea level and increased precipitation. Diatom, ostracod, and delta(18)O evidence indicate that Lake Coba was initially shallow and saline. Coba, presently in the region of greatest rainfall, showed more episodic water-level changes than Lake San Jose Chulchaca or Lake Sayaucil. High lake level and fresh water were evident at 440 cm (similar to 2600 BP), followed by a decline in water levels and an increase in total ionic salinity to the present time. In a 613-cm core from Sayaucil, in the intermediate precipitation zone, total salinity was high between 600 and 400 cm (similar to 3050 and 2000 BP), followed by consistently higher water levels. Salinity was high in the lower portion of a 110-cm San Jose Chulchaca core (beginning similar to 1860 BP), followed by a gradual and consistent freshening of water to the present time.
   Trophic state changes and human influence on lakes were evaluated using diatom, delta(18)O, total P, sedimentary organic matter, and preliminary pollen data. Maximal human disturbance at Lake Coba, a densely settled Maya urban site, occurred during a deep-water event at 440 cm, followed by a decline in human influence and trophic state to the present time. Trophic state and linear sedimentation rates in Sayaucil increased significantly above 400 cm (after similar to 2000 BP), probably associated with initial Maya settlement near Xtojil and subsequent small-scale farming. Limnological disturbance may have preceded the period of maximal human occupation because initial land clearance and consequent soil erosion probably affected water quality substantially. San Jose Chulchaca lacks archaeological evidence of human occupation in the drainage, and shows gradual changes in trophic state not caused by human disturbance. With the exception of a C-14 date on wood from the base of the Coba core, C-14 dates and chronologies may be artificially old as a consequence of hard-water-lake error. Trophic state changes in the study lakes were generally consistent with known patterns of human settlement and population change. Late-Holocene water-level fluctuations were most pronounced in Lake Coba in eastern Yucatan, where modern rainfall is currently greatest, but lake level is generally lower than during much of the past. Lake level was relatively constant in Sayaucil in the central peninsula, whereas lake level in San Jose Chulchaca in the arid western portion of the peninsula increased gradually over time.

AB Conversion to conservation tillage systems increases soil C content by reducing soil erosion and the rate of organic matter oxidation, We hypothesized that these effects could impact soil emission of CO2, This study (i) determined if CO2 emissions were reduced in the first years after conversion to no-tillage (NT) relative to conventional tillage (CT), (ii) evaluated whether differences in soil CO2 emissions between tillage treatments were related to soil temperature differences, and (iii) determined if soil CO2 emission measurements provided an early estimate of soil management practice impact on soil organic C, In 1992 and 1993, CT and NT plots were planted to small-grain cereals in Ottawa, Ontario, on a Dalhousie silt loam (mixed, mesic, Typic Endoaquoll). Fluxes were measured using closed chambers connected to a portable CO2 analyzer, During growing season 1992, the CO2 emissions varied from 0.05 to 0.18 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) with an average of 0.12 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for CT and of 0.10 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for NT. In 1993, the CO2 emissions varied from 0.06 to 0.35 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) with an average of 0.15 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in both tillage treatments, Differences in soil CO2 fluxes between treatments were related to differences in soil temperature (r(2) = 0.62), giving an estimate of 75 g C m(-2) yr(-1) difference in organic C transfers to the atmosphere between CT and NT. These results were validated using an independent estimation derived from long-term field experiments, Thus, soil CO2 flux measurements using dynamic closed chambers can provide early estimates of soil management impacts on soil organic C.

TI Interrelationships between land abandonment and land degradation: A case
   from the Ecuadorian Andes
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English

ID SPANISH PYRENEES; SEDIMENT YIELD; DRAINAGE-BASIN; SOIL-EROSION
AB Although accelerated rainfall runoff and soil erosion in inhabited mountain regions are often linked to cultivation practices on steep hillsides, fields that have been abandoned can pose an even greater risk of rapid runoff and soil erosion. This paper presents new evidence of land degradation resulting from land abandonment in the Ecuadorian Andes and examines the Andean case in light of recent research on land abandonment from the Pyrenees and Himalaya. The Ecuadorian data, based on 109 field rainfall simulation experiments, indicate that runoff and erosion rates on abandoned/fallow fields are significantly higher than those of cultivated lands. Analyses of total percent carbon show abandoned/fallow field soil samples to contain significantly less organic matter than those under other land uses. Continued degradation and high runoff coefficients in abandoned/fallow fields in both the Andes and the Pyrenees are linked to the ongoing, informal use of these lands for grazing. Active management strategies are required to reverse the resulting scenario of increasing land degradation.

DE degraded Alfisols; subhumid Alfisols; sustainable management practices
AB The subhumid zone Alfisols of Nigeria are fragile, dominated by low-activity clays,; and have inherently moderate to low fertility status. Following intensive use of the soils for crop and livestock production, the soils are being degraded by soil erosion, drought, complete removal of both crop and residues, improper management practices, and overgrazing. The present investigation was aimed at defining the soil properties and arresting their continued degradation. The study area is located in the savanna zone, near Kaduna, Nigeria. The study involved a reconnaissance survey at which four soil units were delineated. Typical profiles were studied in detail, characterized in the field and in samples obtained for physical or chemical analysis. The upland soils (crest to upper, upper to middle, and middle to lower slope positions) have shallow Ap, sandy clay loam and clay loam texture, and are plinthic and mottled in the subsoil horizons. The valley basin soils are loam, have a moderately thick surface horizon, are flooded at a shallow depth of 50 cm, and are mottled even at the surface horizons. Acidity of the upland soils is in the extremely acid range (pH 4.4.-4.8). In the valley basin, soil acidity is in the strongly acid range (pH 5.0-5.1). Organic carbon and total nitrogen values of the soils are generally moderate at the surface but decrease to low and very low values in the subsurface horizons. Cation exchange capacities of the soils are adequate to control leaching losses of soil nutrients, especially at the surface horizons.

AB The amounts and types of extractable hydrocarbon components in sediment cores from the Rochester Basin of eastern Lake Ontario provide a record of environmental changes that have accompanied the settlement and population growth of the surrounding land areas. Sediments deposited prior to the mid-1800s contain low concentrations of hydrocarbons that are dominated by land-plant wax components. Concentrations begin to rise in the late 1800s as erosion of soil and nutrients from watershed areas accelerated. This pattern continues into modern times. Episodes of enhanced aquatic productivity are sometimes recorded in twentieth-century sediments by the dominance of algal hydrocarbons, but land-plant components typically predominate. Petroleum residues begin to appear in sediments deposited in the late 1800's but remain minor constituents of the hydrocarbon contents of modern sediments in the Rochester Basin.

AB Five riparian herbaceous plants, Leonotis nepetaefolia, Cassia tora, Ageratum conyzoides, Parthenium hysterophorus and Sida acuta, dominant on the banks of the Rihand river at Renukoot (India), were selected to assess experimentally their quantitative role in conserving organic-C, Na, K and Ca. Young seedlings from the river bank were planted on sloping experimental plots made of alluvial soil. Simulated rainfall totalling 42.5 mm was applied at 300 mm h(-1) on five vegetated and one bare plots. Runoff water and eroded soil were collected from each experimental plot in artificial reservoirs and their quantities were measured. The soil conservation value of the five selected species ranged between 33 and 84% while the water conservation value varied between 19 and 50%. The overall nutrient conservation value, based on the losses in runoff water and eroded soil taken together, varied from 30 to 83% for organic-C, 19 to 78% for Na, 13 to 72% for K and 29 to 52% for Ca under different species. Loss of these four nutrients in response to 42.5 mm simulated rainfall was much higher than their input through rainfall. Loss value for the nutrients were in following order: organic-C > Ca > K > Na. The fraction of organic-C transported down the slope was higher in eroded soil (averaging 73%) and of exchangeable bases in runoff water (averaging 86% for Na, 82% for K and 90% for Ca). Flow-weighted concentrations of all the studied nutrients were consistently greater from bare stands. Number of fine roots was found to play greater role in the case of organic-C (92%; p < 0.01) and Na (70%; p < 0.05) runoff and their conservation by different plant species but canopy cover played greater role for K (58%; p < 0.08) and Ca (90%; p < 0.01).

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIOXIDE; CO2
AB Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally. The Climate Change Action Plan commits the USA to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 106 x 10(6) Mg C yr(-1) by the year 2000. One suggestion for reducing net emissions is to convert marginal grass pastures to pine (Pinus spp.) plantations in the South-Central USA. We used the Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model to estimate the amount of atmospheric C that could be sequestered by this suggested change in land use. Carbon flow dynamics at each of 100 randomly selected sites were simulated for 50 yr under two assumptions: (i) continuous pasture for 50 yr or (ii) pine plantations harvested every 25 yr. Carbon sequestered by conversion to pine plantations was calculated as the net change in off-site storage (i.e., in long-lived products and landfills), plus the change in soil organic C, plus (for the first harvest period) stand establishment. Average C-sequestration (+/-SE) was 40 +/- 2 and 18 +/- 2 Mg C ha(-1) for the first and second 25-yr harvest periods, respectively, In contrast, sequestration would have been 8.3 +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) as soil organic C if the sites had been left in continuous pasture for 50 yr, or 3 Mg C ha(-1) after correcting for release of C during manufacture of N-fertilizer. Extrapolated to the region, conversion of 3.6 x 10(6) ha of marginal grass pasture to pine plantations could sequester 5.6 x 10(6) C yr(-1) for the first 25 yr and 1.1 x 10(6) Mg for the second 25 yr. If all types of marginal agricultural land in the region (4.6 x 10(6) ha) were converted to forestry, the corresponding sequestration rates would be 7.4 x 10(6) and 1.4 x 10(6) Mg C yr(-1). In contrast, maintaining the land in continuous pasture would sequester 0.3 x 10(6) Mg C yr(-1).

ID SOIL
AB There is a comparatively large dry aeolian deposition in Negev Desert. The aim of this study was to quantify the contribution of this deposition and of deposited C and N pools. Amounts of aeolian dry deposition and airborne particle concentration near the ground were measured. Total N and dissolvable organic C were determined in the deposited soil surface layer and in airborne particles. The annual mean airborne particle concentration during 3 years varied from 100 to 113 mu g m(-3). The deposited airborne particle accumulation (difference between the total deposition and deflation-erosion) varied from 110 to 220 g m(-1) yr(-1) at the two sites studied. The C and N content in the airborne particles and in the dry deposit was significantly higher in the loessical site than in the lithosol site. Considering the differences in the amounts of total dry deposition and the deposited C and N, it becomes possible to address the ecological role of the dry deposition in the ecosystem.

AB Stable oxygen and carbon isotope data from a lacustrine sequence at Graenge, southeast Denmark, revealed distinct environmental changes related to Late Weichselian climatic development in the region. Comparison of isotopic records obtained from sedimentary carbonates and freshwater molluscs enabled reconstruction of changes in the lacustrine environment. The degree of thermal and chemical stratification of the lake was evaluated and supported by pollen data from an earlier study of the site. During the Allerod interstadial, dimictic and stagnant conditions characterized the lake, whereas the stratification was disturbed during the Younger Dryas stadial probably as a result of deforestation and increased wind impact. The origin of sedimentary carbonates was examined by mineralogic and morphologic studies. A considerable input of clastics and detrital carbonates, associated with pronounced enrichment of O-18 and C-13, was recorded in the Younger Dryas sediments indicating soil degradation and increased erosion. A climatic warming preceding the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary is clearly reflected in the different stable isotope records and in the lithostratigraphy.

AB For a large set of major world rivers we established the empirical relations existing between the observed organic carbon fluxes and the climatic, biologic, and geomorphologic patterns characterizing the river basins. These characteristics were extracted from various ecological databases. The corresponding carbon fluxes were taken from the literature. Dissolved organic carbon fluxes are mainly related to drainage intensity, basin slope, and the amount of carbon stored in soils. Particulate organic carbon fluxes are calculated as a function of sediment fluxes, which depend principally upon drainage intensity, rainfall intensity, and basin slope. Although the drainage intensity is mainly related to the amount of precipitation and to mean temperature in the basin, slope is also retained as one of the controlling factors. Our empirical models result in a total organic carbon flux to the oceans of about 0.38 Gt per year globally. About 0.21 Gt carbon (Gt C) enter the oceans in dissolved form and about 0.17 Gt C in particulate form, We further regionalize fluxes with respect to major climates, different continents, and different ocean basins. About 45% of the organic carbon is discharged from tropical wet regions. The major part of the dissolved organic carbon is discharged into the Atlantic Ocean, while the bulk of the particulate organic carbon is discharged into the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

AB The presence of native prairies in the Lower Wisconsin River valley that have not been cropped affords a mean of comparison across undisturbed and managed ecosystems. A native prairie soil and a prairie converted to corn (Zea mays L.) and red pine (Pinus resinosa Aiton) plantations were studied to determine the influence of vegetation on soil-forming processes in the sandy landscape of the Lower Wisconsin River valley. Effects of afforestation and cultivation were determined by separating organic matter among particle-size and chemical fractions, differentiating among forms of extractable Fe and Al, and measuring dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Fe and Al in bulk precipitation, throughfall, and soil solutions at three depths. The soil under native prairie vegetation showed distinctive horizonation, including an umbric epipedon formed by melanization. Thickness of the A horizon was significantly less in the forested and cultivated soils than in the prairie soil. Greater amounts of the floatable fraction of organic C, fulvic acids, and Fe-organic complexes were present in the forested soils than in the prairie soil. Carbon concentration in the A horizon of the cultivated soil was significantly lower than in the prairie and forested soils, due to losses by erosion, decomposition, and DOC leaching. In the cultivated soil, the floatable and humin fractions showed the greatest decrease in C concentration compared with the prairie soil. Analysis of the solution data indicated leaching of soluble Pe-organic complexes under coniferous and corn vegetation, suggesting that afforestation and cultivation initiated incipient podzolization.

AB The paper examines the relationships between soil aggregate stability, selected soil properties and land use in central Spain. Aggregate stability indices derived from three procedures were found to be significantly (p > 0.01) correlated with each other as well as with clay content, organic carbon and a range of water-soluble salts. Soils with a higher clay content have a lower aggregate stability. It appears that the presence of expandable clays has a major negative influence, although this impact is strongly modified by recent land-use history and contemporary land-management practices. Agricultural land, abandoned in the 1940s, was subsequently invaded by Cistus matorral or planted with Pinus. The most stable aggregates occur under matorral and may represent a lag of more resistant aggregates surviving past land-use-related erosional processes. Comparisons with aggregates under Pinus however suggest that hydrophobic substances from the Cistus may have increased aggregate stability. Aggregates from areas remaining in cultivation are the least resistant although the stability envelope overlaps with areas under Pinus. These differences may be related to cultivation practices whereby clay-rich subsurface horizons characterized by higher proportions of expandable clays are drawn to the surface, and to enhancement of aggregate stability under forest by fungal hyphae.

AB A field experiment was carried out to evaluate the growth response of Pinus halepensis seedlings inoculated with Pisolithus arhizus and planted in a terraced rangeland amended with urban solid refuse. The application of the organic amendment mediated a significant increase in soil fertility and soil water content. Twenty seven months after planting seedling survival rates did not differ significantly among treatments and were above 95% in all cases. Growth of I! halepensis was significantly (p<0.01) enhanced by the refuse application independently of their mycorrhizal status at the beginning of the experiment. A multiple regression analysis including available soil P concentration and sorptivity as independent variables explained up to 60% of the variance in pine growth observed across treatments. Inoculation with Ii arhizus also significantly (p<0.01) enhanced pine growth with repect to the controls grown in both amended and nonamended plots. It was conduded that the combination of soil terracing, refuse amendment and I! arhizus inoculation significantly improved the performance of Pinus halepensis, and this methodology could be successfully applied in afforestation programmes in semiarid and degraded sites.

AB Chemical properties and nutrient availability were measured in soil profiles of fire-prone, semiarid, Mediterranean-type shrublands in Sierra de Almijara (SE Spain). The area is steep and has a xeric moisture regime. In such conditions, soils developed on kakiritized (sugarlike microstructure) dolomitic marble have distinctive features such as a very coarse texture, extremely high carbonate content, and low nutrient availability. These soils support site-specific shrubland communities with many dolomitophile plant endemisms. During the last decades, the area has been subjected to a high fire frequency and intensive erosion, causing deforestation and soil degradation. To assess the problem, we chose a four-stage chronosequence representative of these changes, which included examples ranging from a long-unburned, dense, mature garigue stand, to an open, frequently burned, regenerating, gorse scrubland. The linear increase in the fire frequency along the chronosequence was associated to a sharp depletion of soil-available nutrients, namely, exchangeable cations, extractable mineral N, and especially NaHCO3-extractable inorganic P. The NH4+/NO3- ratio decreased through the sequence. Organic matter contents were >10%, and total N concentrations were >4 mg N g(-1) in surface soils of the long-unburned garigue site, which contrasted with values of <4% and 1 mg N g(-1), respectively, in the most frequently burned, regenerating scrubland site. This decline of available nutrients is related to the slow recovery of the original garigue vegetation, or even substitution by other more degraded vegetation formations, that is observed in eroded sites, as well as with the lack of successful reforestation programs currently under way at the study site.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of coffee tree population density on soil fertility levels after fourteen years of a field experiment. A field trial was established in 1977 at Londrina, State of Parana, Brazil, with four commercial coffee cultivars (Catuai Amarelo, Acaia, Icatu and Mundo Novo) in the following population densities : 893, 1020, 1190, 1429, 1786, 2381, 3571 and 7143 holes / ha with 2 trees / hole. In 1991 soil samples were collected from 0 to 20 cm soil depth from each plot for chemical analysis. Increasing plant population per unity of area increased soil pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, available P and organic carbon, and decreased exchangeable Al. These changes in soil fertility were greater under Catuai Amarelo than any other coffee cultivars. Increasing soil surface cover by tree canopy, decresing soil erosion, increasing residue management, decreasing nutrient depletion by leaching and improving nutrient cycling were found to be the possible mechanisms envolved in soil chemical improvement with increasing coffee tree population density.

AB A simple method was developed for estimating the carbon concentration of fulvic acid from soil extracts at pH 2. Visible absorbance (410 nm) was measured in 20 samples of fulvic acids from different regions of Argentina. Linear regression analysis of absorbance as a function of carbon concentration yielded a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.983**). The proposed method is expected to be useful in assessing changes in organic matter content as a result of different tillage systems, erosion, plant residues, etc.

AB Twenty-one severely eroded soils of SE Spain (Torriorthent xeric soils) were studied. These soils form a fragile system characterized by soils with a low density of plant cover (<5%), are loamy and occur in a semiarid climate. The soils formerly were used for agricultural purposes but were abandoned al least 15 years ago. These eroded soils had a low total organic carbon content, and their humic substances, humic acid carbon, and carbohydrates were lower compared with soils that had never been cultivated (natural soils). The variables in which the effects of erosion were particularly noted were those related with the active organic matter (respiration and water-soluble organic matter). Those eroded soils with higher salt content showed lower organic matter and carbohydrate contents. Only total nitrogen was correlated with the carbon fractions in the eroded soils.

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

AB The soils of the mountains and plains of Central Asia can be grouped into three formations in relation to the total reserves and the ratio between organic and mineral carbonic compounds in them: (1) carbonate-carbonic, (2) organic-carbonate-carbonic, and (3) highly organic-carbonic. A wealth of pedogenic carbonates from topsoils of arid plain territories is involved in eolian migration due to the activity of deflation processes. Erosion and deflation of soils within subarid foothills and low mountains provide for eolian and water migration of pedo- and lithogenic carbonates as well as of humus-enriched fine earth. Erosion and cryogenic deflation of high mountain soils in humid regions attributes to the runoff of humus- and silica-enriched substances in mountain rivers. Sediments suspended in waters of mountain rivers and irrigation channels are deposited on plain in the form of modern alluvial and irrigation sediments that contain twice as much humus as background Gray-Brown and Takyr-like desert soils.

TI Impacts of climate change on soils and land systems in New Zealand
SO GREENHOUSE: COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Proceedings Paper
CT Meeting on Greenhouse - Coping with Climate Change (GREENHOUSE 94)
CY OCT 10-14, 1994
CL WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND
SP Austr & New Zealand Environm & Conservat Council
AB About 65% of New Zealand's economy is based on its natural and managed land systems and soils. Present understanding of their relative sensitivity to climate change is generally poor and largely qualitative. This paper examines the possible impacts of an enhanced greenhouse effect, with particular emphasis being given to identifying the most sensitive land systems and soils. A scenario of climate change, based on the IS92a emissions scenario of the IPCC, is used.
   The sensitivity of land systems is examined in two ways, Firstly, a first-order indication of how agroecosystems might respond to climate change is illustrated by assessing possible spatial changes in grain maize suitability. Secondly, susceptibility of land to erosion, with possible concomitant losses in productivity is assessed against changes in precipitation. The analysis suggested only small changes in erosion severity appear likely except in critical areas where a substantial increase could result from increases in storm frequency and intensity.
   In evaluating the sensitivity of soils, the emphasis is on soil organic matter. Soil organic matter, which stabilises topsoils and stores most of the nutrients, is critically important for the sustainability of land systems. Spatially referenced data for land use, soil carbon and climate are used in a model to indicate the possible responses of organic matter to climate change for the major ecosystems of New Zealand. Reductions in soil carbon of about 5-6% per degree temperature increase were generally expected in the absence of effects from carbon dioxide fertilization and increased nutrient availability. Soils likely to reach critical minimum-threshold concentrations of organic matter over the next 60 years are identified.

ID PIEDMONT SOILS; EROSION; PRODUCTIVITY; AFRICA
AB Erosion-productivity experiments were conducted in the Kilimanjaro, Tanga, and Morogoro ecoregions for seven predominant soils of these areas. Decrease in topsoil thickness adversely affected a number of soil properties and reduced maize grain yield. Among the most important effects were diminution of soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, total soil N (TSN), available P, available water capacity (AWC), and water saturation percentage. The magnitude of effects differed between soils and ecoregions. Maize grain yield was positively and significantly correlated with topsoil thickness, SOC, total N, CEC, and AWC. Maize grain yield declined at the rate of 38.5, 55.0 and 87.7 kg per cm decrease in topsoil thickness in the Kilimanjaro, Tanga and Morogoro ecoregions, respectively.

AB In this study, the soils on the steeplands of Sabacan, Himaya, and San Jose, and on the uplands and alluvial areas of Musuan, were mapped, characterized morphologically and chemically, and classified based on the USDA Soil Taxonomy, The mineralogy of the various soil horizons has been determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   The soils in the steepland and upland areas are classified as Typic Hapludalfs and Lithic Dystropepts, The floodplain is occupied by Typic Tropaquepts, The pH of the Ap horizons is moderately acid in Typic Hapludalfs and Typic Dystropepts and strongly acid in Typic Tropaquepts, The apparent cation exchange capacity is very high in these soils, characterized by low contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen, a very low available phosphorus and low base status.
   XRD analysis showed that gibbsite, quartz, halloysite and hydroxy interlayered 2:1 minerals are present in the clay fraction of all soils, TEM showed goethite as acicular crystals extending into pores like needles and lepidocrocite as highly elongated flakes found abundant in the sub-soils of Typic Tropaquepts.
   Typic Hapludalfs are deep, well-drained soils suitable for upland cultivation, Use of light implements would help minimize soil compaction during land preparation, and contour plowing would alleviate soil erosion hazards on these soils, The coarse-textured Lithic Dystropepts, which have a coherent underlying hard rock material at 50 cm of the mineral surface, would require proper drainage, A clayey texture and a massive structure with redoximorphic conditions pose aeration problems in the Typic Tropaquepts, These soils could best be utilized for lowland rice cultivation.

AB The effectiveness of crop residues to protect the soil surface and reduce soil erosion decreases as residues decompose. The rate of residue decomposition is directly related to the temperature and moisture regimes of the residues. Predicting changes in residue mass, orientation, and soil cover requires the use of functions that relate changes in decomposition rates to changes in the temperature and water regimes. Temperature and water functions used in the residue decomposition submodel of the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) were evaluated for their effects on predictions of residue decomposition. A precipitation function (PC) was found to produce relatively more accurate estimates of decomposition than a near surface soil water content function (SWC) for describing water regime effects. The estimated accuracies of the two functions were similar when bias in the estimation was considered. Predictions made with PC had estimated accuracies of +/-11.4, 14.5, 13.5% for alfalfa, sorghum and wheat, respectively, while those made with SWC had estimated accuracies of +/-13.8, 16.2, and 16.9%, respectively. Three temperature functions were compared for use in predicting residue decomposition over a range of locations and crops. There was little difference between the temperature functions over all the locations but, for several locations, one function overpredicted decomposition more often than the other two functions. Accuracies ranged from +/-4 to +/-51% of the observed values. The highest values were obtained at one location, and all three temperature functions produced similar high values. Over most of the data, estimated accuracies were generally between +/-15 and +/-25%. The prediction intervals were similar to those observed for decomposition of surface-placed residues. This evaluation indicates that the temperature and water functions used in the WEPS decomposition submodel will give seasonable estimates of mass loss from surface residues using easy-to-obtain weather data.

AB A characterization of eroded soil properties, especially size, is required for proper usage of modern process-based soil erosion models. In a study addressing reclaimed mine land erodibility, over 350 measured eroded aggregate size distributions were collected from erosion plots created on reclaimed and nearby unmined soils at three separate strip mine sites. The experimental design allowed for a comparison of eroded aggregate size distributions as a function of land slope, run sequence, and reclamation treatment. No influence of slope was apparent, as distributions collected from plots constructed at 6% slope were coarser than those collected from 18% slope, but finer than those collected from 12%. Samples collected during extra inflow runs, in which runoff rates, flow velocity, and rill erosion were greatest, had coarser distributions than samples collected during rainfall only runs, which tended to have similar distributions. Distributions from reclaimed topsoil treatments were similar to nearby unmined soils and were distinct from subsoil reclamation treatments. At two sires, topsoil treatments had coarser distributions, while the converse was true at the third.
   Distributions taken from topsoil and unmined soil treatments were used to develop five regression equations to predict the percentage of total eroded soil mass falling into each of five size classes-clay, silt, and three sand sizes. A stepwise, multivariate regression technique was used to select the best independent variables from 30 soil parameters. Independent variables that proved to be significant in at least one equation include primary particle and water stable aggregate size distributions, bulk density, organic carbon, and soil moisture. The number of significant independent variables ranges from II to 15 and correlation coefficients (R(2)) range from 0.77 to 0.53, which is a general improvement over previously published prediction methods.

AB Raised wide beds have been proposed as a conservation tillage practice for reducing erosion losses in vertisols, but few measurements of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses have been reported. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of tillage systems and fertilizer N application methods on sediment and nutrient losses associated with interrill runoff. Simulated rainfall events (125 mm h(-1) until 30 min of runoff had occurred) were applied to raised wide beds (0.15 m high and 1.5 m wide with 0.5-m-wide furrows) on a Houston Black clay (fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellusterts) which had been managed with either a no-till or a chisel-till tillage system. Three simulated methods of applying fertilizer N (surface band, coulter-nozzle, or spoke wheel simulated field practices) were compared in a split plot experimental design with four replications. Total N and P losses, as well as fertilizer N losses, in both sediment and solution from interrill runoff were determined from 1 m(2) plots. While no P was applied in fertilizer, greater P losses were observed with the chisel-till compared to no-till. While N losses in runoff were relatively low, fertilizer N application with surface banding or the coulter-nozzle applicator in no-till had greater total N and fertilizer N losses. Under relatively wet soil water conditions, respective losses of total inorganic N and fertilizer N in solution were greater from no-till with 4.0 and 2.0 kg N ha(-1) lost, as compared to 0.2 and 0.1 kg N ha(-1) lost from chisel-till per rainfall event. Losses of N in sediment were greatest in chisel-till, with 2.1 and 0.03 kg N ha(-1) lost from chisel-till, as compared to 0.6 and 0.01 kg N ha(-1) lost from no-till, of total N and fertilizer N per rainfall event, respectively The greatest N losses during the runoff event was observed with the surface banded and coulter-nozzle fertilizer application methods in no-till due to increased fertilizer N losses.

AB Land use activities, particularly related to agriculture and forestry can have considerable impact on the biological health of soils. In the UK some soils are poor in soil organic matter and it has been suggested that these soils are vulnerable to inappropriate farming activities. Existing monitoring of soil biological health appears limited and poorly co-ordinated. To address this problem the agro-ecosystem is conceived as a three dimensional structure in which the distribution of carbon plays a central role. Issues associated with the construction of a monitoring framework to provide policy relevant information on soil biological health are discussed and examples of techniques which may usefully be incorporated in such a framework are presented. In conclusion an action plan for monitoring soil biological health is proposed which includes the integration of experimental, modelling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques so that information can be provided at both a national and local scale.

AB Soil erosion and runoff were monitored from 1988 to 1990 on a Miamian soil (Typic Hapludalf) of 5-6 per cent slope using field runoff plots. Four treatments were studied: (i) disk-plough up and down the slope to 0.3 m depth (DP); (ii) disk-plough up and down the slope followed by a protective netting (PN); (iii) uncultivated fallow without any vegetation followed by surface soil removal (R); (iv) uncultivated fallow with natural vegetation followed by ploughing (F). Mean annual runoff losses were 6, 114 and 128 mm, or 4, 20 and 18 per cent of the rainfall, and mean annual soil losses were 1.2, 85.0 and 64.0 Mg ha(-1) in 1988, 1989 and 1990, respectively. Mean runoff amounts were 26, 69, 116 and 118 mm and mean annual soil losses were 04, 23.2, 58.6 and 118 Mg ha(-1) for the F, PN, DP and R treatments, respectively. In comparison with DP, PN decreased annual runoff by 40.3 per cent and annual soil loss by 79.5 per cent. The high mean soil loss for the R treatment was due to erosion following soil removal. An additional 2920 Mg ha(-1) of surface soil was removed from the R treatment in May 1990. The F treatment reduced runoff by 78, 77 and 62 per cent and reduced soil loss by 99.7, 99.4 and 98.4 per cent compared with the R, DP and PN treatments, respectively. Mean losses of K, Ca, Mg and P were 1.3, 4, 1 and 0.1 kg ha(-1), respectively for F, 3, 16, 5 and 0.3 kg ha(-1), respectively, for PN, 5, 31, 1 and 0.6 kg ha(-1), respectively, for DP, and 3, 32, 12 and 0.4 kg ha(-1), respectively, for R. Soil and nutrient losses for each treatment were in the order R > DP > PN > F. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content was significantly affected by soil erosion and management treatments, and ranged from 0.98 per cent for the R treatment to 2.3 per cent for the F treatment. Soil surface removal for the R treatment in 1990 reduced water-stable aggregates (WSA) by 9.0 per cent, SOC by 0.6 per cent, and clay content of the uppermost 0-50 mm depth by about 7.0 per cent. Mean total porosity (f(t)) ranged from 0.43 for the F to 0.52 for the DP treatment. Cumulative infiltration for 3 h ranged from 13 cm for R to 34 cm for PN, with corresponding infiltration rates of 4cm h(-1) and 13 cm h(-1), respectively. Regardless of the treatment, there were also temporal changes in soil properties. In comparison with 1988, measurements made in 1990 showed a significant decrease in WSA of 21.3 per cent, an increase in clay content of 2.8 per cent, and a decrease in SOC of 0.39 per cent. Runoff and soil losses were significantly correlated with the mean weight diameter (MWD), SOC, bulk density (rho(b)) and available water capacity (AWC). Plant height measured 8 weeks after planting (WAP) for the R treatment was reduced by 33.3 per cent, 33.0 per cent and 29.0 per cent compared withh DP, PN and F, respectively. Nitrogen uptake by maize plants (Zea mays L.) 10 WAP for the R treatment was lower by 15 per cent, 8 per cent, and 6 per cent compared with the DP, PN and F treatments, respectively, while P uptake was lower by 33 per cent, 32 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, compared with the same treatments. Grain yield was 9.78 Mg ha(-1) for PN, 9.76 Mg ha(-1) for DP, 8.64 Mg ha(-1) for F and 6.60 Mg ha(-1) for R during the 1990 crop season. Grain yield was reduced by about 32.4 per cent in the R treatment compared with the PN treatment, representing a maize grain yield reduction of 158 kg ha(-1) for each centimeter of soil lost.

AB An experiment was conducted during summer, 1992, in a protected bay of the La Grande-2 reservoir (northern Quebec) to evaluate the role of erosional processes in the transfer of mercury from a flooded soil to the water column. Up to 57% of the organic carbon, approximately 4% of the inorganic mercury, and nearly 71% of the methylmercury from the humic horizon of a flooded podzol were transferred to the water column and transported outside the experimental perimeter in the form of particulate matter after one resuspension event. In contrast, total dissolved mercury concentrations in the water column decreased during the resuspension event as a result of scavenging by suspended particles. We postulate that most of the methylmercury produced in the submerged soils is associated with fine-grained organic particles that remain in suspension for some time before flocculating and accumulating at the sediment-water interface. We suspect that these particles are a potential food source and can be readily ingested by pelagic and benthic detritus-feeders as well as trapped by periphyton. Resuspension and erosion processes along the exposed shores of a recently impounded reservoir may thus accelerate the transfer of mercury, primarily as methylmercury, from flooded soils to predatory fish.

AB Assessments of management-induced changes in soil organic matter depend on the methods used to calculate the quantities of organic C and N stored in soils. Chemical analyses in the laboratory indicate the concentrations of elements in soils, but the thickness and bulk density of the soil layers in the field must be considered to estimate the quantities of elements per unit area. Conventional methods that calculate organic matter storage as the product of concentration, bulk density and thickness do not fully account for variations in soil mass. Comparisons between the quantities of organic C, N, P and S in Gray Luvisol soils under native aspen forest and various cropping systems were hampered by differences in the mass of soil under consideration. The influence of these differences was eliminated by calculating the masses of C, N, P and S in an ''equivalent soil mass'' (i.e. the mass of soil in a standard or reference surface layer). Reassessment of previously published data also indicated that estimates of organic matter storage depended on soil mass. Appraisals of organic matter depletion or accumulation usually were different for comparisons among element masses in an equivalent soil mass than for comparisons among element masses in genetic horizons or in fixed sampling depths. Unless soil erosion or deposition had altered the mass of topsoil per unit area, comparisons among unequal soil masses were unjustified and erroneous. For management-induced changes in soil organic matter and nutrient storage to be assessed reliably, the masses of soil being compared must be equivalent.

AB The effects of management practices on erosion and crop productivity for different agro-ecosystems in Canada are largely unknown. A study was conducted to examine the effects of management on soil loss and wheat yield in long-term research plots, established in western Canada. Soil erosion was measured using the Cs-137 technique. Under conventional tillage, topsoil was lost at a rate of 2-37 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Equivalent loss in topsoil thickness ranged between 0.02 and 0.28 cm yr(-1). Soil losses were highest in 2-yr wheat-fallow crop rotations. Continuous wheat, 5-yr cereal-hay rotations, and plots amended with manure reduced soil losses and maintained thicker topsoils. At Ellerslie, Alberta, there was no measurable soil loss from a Black Chemozemic cropped to continuous barley under zero tillage. Decrease in annual wheat yield averaged 106 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) topsoil loss in the Brown Chernozemic and 117 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) topsoil loss in the Gray Luvisol.

AB Accelerated erosion can have adverse effects on soil properties and crop yield. Therefore, an on-farm evaluation of the effects of past soil erosion on productivity was done for a Miamian soil (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) in central Ohio in 1991. Three levels of soil erosion identified by a field survey and topsoil depth included slight (20-25 cm topsoil depth), moderate (15-20 cm) and severe erosion (10-15 cm). Soybean yield and soil properties under these conditions were compared with those for uneroded soil (wooded conditions with topsoil of 25-30 cm depth) and for deposition sites (30-35 cm depth). Soil properties measured included bulk density, particle density, organic carbon contents, infiltration capacity, and moisture retention at different suctions. Bulk density of 0 to 10 cm depth was significantly low in uneroded control (1.20 Mg/m(3)). High bulk density of 1.45 to 1.49 Mg/m(3) was observed in moderately and severely eroded phases. The moisture retention at 0.03 MPa (0.47 V/V) was the highest in uneroded control. The highest available water capacity of the 0 to 10 cm layer (0.16 to 0.17 V/V) was observed for wooded control and slight erosion phase. Total aggregation was also the least on slightly eroded phase. Soil organic carbon content did not differ among three erosional phases with a 0 to 10 cm depth mean value of 1.03% compared with 1.83% for deposition and 2.93% for wooded soils. Similar trends were observed for the 10 to 20 cm depth. Concentrations of exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg and total CEC increased with increasing degree of erosion for both depths. There were no differences in CEC of the 0 to 10 cm depth for severely eroded and wooded soils. The rainfall received during 1991 was below normal. There were no differences in soybean yield among slight, moderate and severely eroded phases. Because of severe crusting and drought stress, crop stand was poor on slightly eroded plateau soils. Adverse soil physical conditions, low soil organic carbon content, severe crusting, and drought were likely responsible factors for low yields on slightly eroded plateau soils. Soybean grain yield was 1.5 Mg/ha for slight erosion, 1.4 Mg/ha for moderate erosion, 1.6 Mg/ha for severe erosion, and 3.1 Mg/ha for deposition

AB Soils of northeastern Nigeria (subject to wind erosion) were studied for erodibility. Samples of the surface soil were analyzed to determine the percentages of sand, silt, clay, organic carbon, and calcium carbonate and the aggregate stability and size distribution. The intrinsic and dynamic soil properties contributed to the erodibility of the soils. The sandy northern part of the study area had higher percentages of fine sand and lower percentages of silt, clay, and organic carbon, quite variable amounts of calcium carbonate, and lower aggregate stability and size distribution in comparison with the southern half of the study area. Soils in the south were more stable, with larger nonerodible size distribution and 50% less wind-erodible fraction than the north. The computed soil-erodible fraction from soil properties was highly correlated (r = 0.89, p < 0.01) with the measured erodible fraction. This implies that soil erodibility can be computed from the soil's physical and chemical properties for northeastern Nigeria when a standard compact rotary sieve is not available.

AB The dynamics of soil organic C after a change in cropping practice are important in defining the potential impact of the new practice on soil behavior and net CO2 exchange. Our objective was to determine the duration and magnitude of a shift in soil organic C after a change in summer fallow frequency in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) systems. Total organic and light-fraction C in continuous wheat (W), fallow-wheat-wheat (FWW), and fallow-wheat (FW) treatments were determined in soil samples collected periodically from 1954 to 1992 from a long-term spring wheat study located in the northern Great Plains. Organic C concentrations in the 0- to 15-cm depth were 11% lower in the FW and FWW treatments than in the W treatment from 1967 to 1992. Organic C concentrations in the 15- to 30-cm depth were not affected by treatment, but varied among sampling years due to differences in effective sampling depth. Light-fraction C concentrations were 38% lower in the FW and FWW treatments than in the W treatment from 1967 to 1992. Reduced light-fraction C accounted for about one-third of the decrease in total organic C due to inclusion of fallow in the crop rotation. The negative influence of fallow was primarily due to enhanced decomposition in the fallow year. We conclude that most losses of soil organic C due to introduction of a falloff system occur within two decades, and that further loss of organic C is negligible provided soil erosion is minimal.

AB Four plots from a mixed conifer forest were similarly cleared, burned, and replanted at various times over 17 years; a plot logged 79 years before sampling was used as a control. The plots had similar slope (2 to 15%, midslope position), aspect (south to southeast), and soil type (Holland series: mesic Haploxeralf; a Gray Brown Luvisol in the Canadian classification system). Twenty sites at each plot were sampled volumetrically by horizon to 20 cm below the organic - mineral soil boundary. Samples were analyzed for bulk density, organic C, and total N. There was an initial loss (15%) of organic C from the soil within 1 to 7 years, likely the result of oxidation (burning and decomposition) and erosion. For 17 years of forest regrowth, the soil continued to lose C (another 15%), probably owing to decomposition of slash material and possibly erosion, despite the slight accumulation of new litter and roots. After 80 years of regrowth, rates of carbon accumulation exceeded fates of loss, but carbon storage had declined and was not likely to recover to preharvest levels. Timber harvest and site preparation dramatically altered soil C and N distribution, in which C/N ratios after site preparation were initially high throughout the upper 20 cm. Subsequently, C/N ratios became lower with depth and with recovery age. Although stocks of C and N varied considerably among the plots and did not change consistently as a function of recovery age, the C/N ratios did vary systematically with recovery age. We hypothesize that the amount of C ultimately stored in the soil at steady state depends largely on N reserves and potentials, which appear to vary with erosion, intensity of burning, and site treatment.

AB Maintaining soil stability and normal water and nutrient cycles in desert systems is critical to avoiding desertification. These particular ecosystem processes are threatened by trampling of livestock and people, and by off-road vehicle use. Soil compaction and disruption of cryptobiotic soil surfaces (composed of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses) can result in decreased water availability to vascular plants through decreased water infiltration and increased albedo with possible decreased precipitation. Surface disturbance may also cause accelerated soil loss through wind and water erosion and decreased diversity and abundance of soil biota. In addition, nutrient cycles can be altered through lowered nitrogen and carbon inputs and slowed decomposition of soil organic matter, resulting in lower nutrient levels in associated vascular plants. Some cold desert systems may be especially susceptible to these disruptions due to the paucity of surface-rooting vascular plants for soil stabilization, fewer nitrogen-fixing higher plants, and lower soil temperatures, which slow nutrient cycles. Desert soils may recover slowly from surface disturbances, resulting in increased vulnerability to desertification. Recovery from compaction and decreased soil stability is estimated to take several hundred years. Re-establishment rates for soil bacterial and fungal populations are not known. The nitrogen fixation capability of soil requires at least 50 years to recover. Recovery of crusts can be hampered by large amounts of moving sediment, and re-establishment can be extremely difficult in some areas. Given the sensitivity of these resources and slow recovery times, desertification threatens million of hectares of semiarid lands in the United States.

TI PALEOSOLS IN LATE QUATERNARY COLLUVIUM, NORTHERN KWAZULU-NATAL,

LA English
DT Article
AB Evidence of Late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironmental change in the northern hinterland of the KwaZulu-Natal province, eastern South Africa, is preserved within a widespread sequence of colluvium and intercalated palaeosols, comprising the Masotcheni Formation. Palaeosol profile characteristics and micromorphological features are described for the full stratigraphic succession, preserved at the St Paul's donga reference site and other comparative exposures, permitting the interpretation of pedogenic processes active on hillslopes during the polycyclic accretion of colluvial sediments blanketing many hillslopes in the region. The importance of soil erosion and the transport of pre-weathered sediment and pedorelict aggregates is highlighted. The 'eluilluviation' particle translocation process, commonly synchronous with periodic Fe mobilization and reprecipitation,was active at differing intensities in all of the palaeosols studied. The palaeoclimatic implications of the aforementioned processes during the past similar to 120 ka are placed in chronological context using a series of radiocarbon dates from palaeosol organic matter and soil carbonates and infra red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating of the parent colluvium. The dating framework permits generalized interpretation of the periodicity of erosional and colluvial events as well as the period of existence of palaeosol landsurfaces, which is of relevance when interpreting the age of similar soils on the current landsurface.

AB Fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems may be responsible for declines in soil organic matter and degradation of soil physical properties. A change to annual cropping may improve or at least maintain soil properties. Tillage and crop sequence effects on soil properties and water infiltration were tested after 9 yr of cropping on a Dooley sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiborolls) derived in glacial till. Annual cropping tillage of fall sweep and spring disk (AWFST), and no tillage (AWNT) were compared with conventional tillage in wheat-fallow (FWCT) as the control. Statistical design was a randomized complete block with four replications, Soil samples were taken at 0.03-m increments to a depth of 0.3 m and were used to measure organic carbon (OC), pH, bulk density (BD), and particle size. Point resistance was measured in 0.02-m increments, Water infiltration into dry and wet soil was measured using a rainfall simulator, Maximum soil BD was 1.61 Mg m(-3) on FWCT and 1.56 Mg m(-3) on AWNT. Soil BD was not changed by one winter of freezing and thawing. Maximum point resistance was 2.2 MPa on FWCT and 1.7 MPa on AWNT. Cumulative 3-h infiltration into dry soil was 52 mm for FWCT and 69 mm for AWNT. Final infiltration rate into wet soil was 5 mm h(-1) for FWCT and 6 mm h(-1) for AWNT. There was a significant difference in the depth distribution of OC between annual crop and FWCT treatments. Mass of OC in the top 0.09 m of soil was 1.65 kg m(-2) on annual crop treatments and 1.45 kg m(-2) on FWCT, Greater amounts of OC on the annual crop treatments compared with the FWCT attest to the beneficial aspect of annual cropping in maintaining a level of soil quality that is greater than FWCT. From a soil conservation perspective, no-tillage has an additional advantage because surface cover is maintained throughout the year, thereby reducing the potential for soil erosion.

AB In the Sierra de Carrascoy (Murcia, southeastern Spain), ilimerized soils appear locally with different characteristics from those of the dominant soils. These ilimerized soils are relicts of more stable geomorphological surfaces. Four representative profiles were studied for evaluating their pedogenetic processes and to classify them typologically, Analytical determinations were made of organic carbon, total nitrogen, calcium carbonate equivalent, pH, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, and particle size. Determinations were made of free iron oxide extracted with sodic hydrosulfite, and total iron, silicon, and aluminum oxides, The profiles are of a A-Bt-Ck or A-Bt-R type with a pronounced reddish color (2,5YR or 5YR). The soils have art average organic matter content of 19.6-44.5 g kg(-1) in the surface horizons and, in general, are totally decarbonated. The cation exchange capacity is highest in the argillic horizons (16.9-25.0 cmol(c) kg(-1)), and their electrical conductivity is generally low. They have a Bt horizon (40.2-62.8% clay), a relict of an ancient pedogenesis where cutans, retraction cracks, and slickensides are visible, The ratio of free Fe2O3 to total Fe2O3 is highest in these argilluviation horizons, These soils indicate that different climatological conditions existed in the past, which made decarbonatization, rubefaction, and argilluviation possible. More recent processes of erosion and/or accumulation and recarbonatization have acted on these paleosols (classified as Xerollic Paleargids and Calcic Rhodoxeralfs).

AB Soil-surface seals and crusts resulting from aggregate breakdown reduce the soil infiltration rate and may induce erosion by increasing runoff. The cultivated loess areas of northwestern Europe are particularly prone to these processes.
   Surface samples of ten tilled silty loamy loess soils, ranging in clay content from 120 to 350 g kg(-1) and in organic carbon from 10 to 20 g kg-1, were packed into 0.5 m(2) plots with 5% slopes and subjected to simulated rainfall applied at 30 mm h(-1). The 120 minutes rainfall events were applied to initially field-moist soil, air-dried soil and rewetted soil to investigate the effect of soil moisture content prior to rainfall. Runoff and eroded sediments were collected at 5 minutes intervals. Aggregate stability of the soils was assessed by measuring particle-size distribution after different treatments.
   All soils formed seals. Runoff rates were between 70 and 90% by the end of the rainfall event for field-moist plots. There were large differences between soil runoff rates for the air-dried and rewetted plots. Interrill erosion was associated with runoff, and sediment concentration in runoff readily reached a steady-state value. Measurements of aggregate stability for various treatments were in good agreement with sealing, runoff and erosion responses to rainfall. Runoff and erosion were lower for air-dried plots than for field-moist plots, and were either intermediate or lowest for rewetted plots, depending on soil characteristics. Soils with a high clay content had the lowest erosion rate when they were rewetted, whereas the soil with a high organic-carbon content had the lowest erosion rate in air-dry conditions. The results indicate the complexity of the effect of initial moisture content, and the interactions between soil properties and climate.

AB This paper introduces digital processing of back-scattered electron (BSE) imagery as a microscopic approach to measure porosity from in situ dissolution of minerals. Four case studies exemplify this technique. Cases 1 and 2 explore the initiation and maintenance of weathering forms. In case 1, alveoli start in the Sedona area of Arizona when sandstone porosity exceeds approximately 32%. This threshold is probably the point at which intergrain cohesion is reduced enough for shear stresses to erode grains. Case 2 examines the maintenance of gnamma pits and polygonal cracks on a basalt boulder on the island of Maui, Hawaii. Rock dissolution progresses while the surface of the rock is preserved under coatings of silica glaze. When a porosity of approximately 37%-47% is reached, the weathering rind losses cohesion and spalls. Then, the protective silica glaze starts to accrete again, and another cycle begins.
   Cases 3 and 4 involve measuring rates of dissolution over thousands of years. Case 3 concerns rock dissolution in weathering rinds formed on ventifacted aplite boulders. Weathering rinds lost mass for the last 14 k.y. at a rate of 40 +/- 15 g/m2/k.y., and for the last 17 k.y. at a rate of 43 +/- 16 g/m2/k.y. Dissolution rates increased over time to 67 +/- 23 g/m2/k.y. for the last 60-65 k.y. Case 4 addresses the classic topic of which variable is most important in chemical weathering: temperature, precipitation, or microenvironment. In situ measurements of plagioclase dissolution in approximately 3-k.y.-old basalt flows reveal that warmer temperatures enhance rates of plagioclase dissolution by about 0.07%/degrees-C, when precipitation and microenvironment are controlled. Plagioclase dissolution increases as precipitation increases at higher elevations, even though temperature decreases. However, microenvironment is a more important control on plagioclase dissolution; organic-rich positions (under lichens) weather two to seven times faster than adjacent organic-poor positions away from epilithic organisms and rock coatings.
   Rates of rock weathering are often established indirectly, by measuring the erosion of weathered material. In contrast, this microscopic method measures only in situ weathering. Conventional measures of rock weathering usually involve units, for example, depth of weathering pits or thickness of weathering rinds, that are not readily comparable to other data. In contrast, cases 3 and 4 illustrate that in situ measurements of rock and mineral porosity can yield data on mass weathered per unit area over time. This information is comparable to mass balance approaches in watershed- and soil-based weathering research.

TI THE EFFECT OF SHELTERBELTS ON EROSION AND SOIL PROPERTIES
SO SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
ID LANDFORM CLASSIFICATION; SASKATCHEWAN; CESIUM-137
AB Shelterbelt planting is often recommended as a means to reduce wind erosion. Six sheltered and three unsheltered fields representing moderately coarse to moderately fine textured soils were sampled along transects to determine the effects of the belts on soil wind erosion and soil properties. Cs-137 measurements indicated that shelterbelts about 6 m tall and 200 m apart considerably reduced off-field soil losses from moderately coarse and medium textured soils. Off-field soil losses from unsheltered moderately fine textured soils were low and similar to those from sheltered fields. Shelterbelts did not prevent in-field redistribution, and soil deposition was evident out from the shelterbelts for about 20 m. Organic C and 15-bar water content were increased, and bulk density decreased, in a strip about 10 m wide adjacent to the belts. Increased biomass production from the shelterbelt and its grass edge are probably the main cause for the increased organic C content. Decreased bulk electrical conductivity indicated increased leaching out to about 15 m from the belt. Leaching has also decreased the pH of the surface soil but has not affected the depth to carbonates.

AB Information on spatial distribution of soil properties in a landscape is not only required for soil mapping and classification but also for soil management. Spatial patterns of soil properties in a landscape are the results of systematic variations in pedogenic processes controlled by environmental factors of which landscape position is important. In northeast Brazil, Lithosols (Ustorthents) whose surface horizons are directly underlain by lithic or paralithic contacts occupy upper slope positions with steep gradient; the Cambisols (Ustropepts) occupy the mid- and lower slope positions. In some cases Non-Calcic Brown soils/Planosol (Haplustalfs) occupy lower slopes. We examined the properties of two contiguous hillslopes in granitic and gneissic saprolite to determine whether there were any systematic variations among landscape positions and to interpret pedogenesis in the hillslopes. Particle size distribution, and the Ti content of sand plus silt and saprolite showed that the two hillslopes were formed on different parent materials. At Site 1, soil property variations along the slope, measured by standard deviation from the means, were attributed to variability in parent material rather than to landscape position. Except for solum thickness, which increased systematically downslope, variations in sand, clay, ECEC and pH were not related to landscape position. Increasing solum thickness downslope was explained by the effect of erosion on the upper, and deposition at the lower slopes. Silt and organic carbon contents at Site 1, and Fe-o and Fe-d contents at Site 2 significantly decreased downslope. One possible explanation for this trend, in addition to erosion and deposition, is the effect of slash and burn agriculture on the lower slopes, and the changes in redox conditions caused by periodic waterlogging.

AB We describe a fully automatic image analysis system capable of measuring cell numbers, volumes, lengths, and widths of bacteria in soil smears, The system also determines the number of cells in agglomerates and thus provides the frequency of dividing cells (FDC). Images are acquired from a confocal laser scanning microscope. The grey images are smoothed by convolution and by morphological erosion and dilation to remove noise. The background is equalized by flooding holes in the image and is then subtracted by two top hat transforms, Finally, the grey image is sharpened by delineation, and all particles above a fixed threshold are detected. The number of cells in each detected particle is determined by counting the number of local grey-level maxima in the particle, Thus, up to 1,500 cells in 10 fields of view in a soil smear are analyzed in 30 min without human intervention, Automatic counts of cell numbers and FDC were similar to visual counts in field samples, In microcosms, automatic measurements showed significant increases in cell numbers, FDC, mean cell volume, and length-to-width ratio after amendment of the soil, Volumes of fluorescent microspheres were measured with good approximation, but the absolute values obtained were strongly affected by the settings of the detector sensitivity. Independent measurements of bacterial cell numbers and volumes by image analysis and of cell carbon by a total organic carbon analyzer yielded an average specific carbon content of 200 fg of C mu m(-3), which indicates that our volume estimates are reasonable.

DE AUSTRALIA; MINE REHABILITATION; MINE SPOIL REVEGETATION; OPENCAST MINING
AB Legislation requiring the rehabilitation of new opencast coal mines came into effect in New South Wales, Australia, in 1973.  Mining companies now stockpile original topsoil which is later spread with fertilizer over re-shaped overburden and waste carbonaceous material.  Problems in successfully revegetating new surfaces are exacerbated by the thinness and infertility of natural soils, which are deficient in phosphorus and moderately acid.  Revegetation has not been successful on untreated mine waste and overburden.  This study provides a general overview of some aspects of post-rehabilitation soil chemistry and vegetation on these soils.  A limited number of samples, collected from three mine sites having different rainfall and varying ages of rehabilitated areas, were tested for pH, EC, organic carbon, total phosphorus and available aluminium.  Rehabilitated areas were all characterised by very low levels of total phosphorus, neutral pH, and variable and relatively low organic carbon, and some showed aluminium toxicity.  Heavy application of gypsum at one of the steeper sites was associated with acid pH, high EC values, low total P, Al toxicity, some soil erosion and little plant cover.  Except for this site, the variable vegetation cover at the sites studied seemed adequate for long-term re-establishment, despite serious weed invasion at some non-studied sites, soil loss on newly re-formed surfaces, and generally poor natural and rehabilitated soils.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the effect of long-term cultivation on clay dispersibility of four aggregate size fractions (2.0-9.5 mm, 0.85-2.0 mm, 0.25-0.85 mm, and <0.25 mm) obtained from a Chernozemic soil by comparing two cultivated sites with an adjacent native prairie site. Aggregate size fractions (ASF) were subjected to increasing levels of ultrasonic energy and the amount of clay dispersed at each energy level was determined. Organic carbon, hexose carbon, soluble hexose C, total clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable cations were measured for each ASF. Clay contained within prairie aggregates was held much more strongly within the aggregate and therefore showed greater stability towards dispersion by ultrasonic vibration. More energy was required to disperse one-half of the ASF clay under prairie than under cultivated soils (228-425, and 95-229 kl L(-1) for prairie and cultivated macroaggregates, respectively; 370-433, and 249-334 kj L(-1) for prairie and cultivated microaggregates, respectively). Clay dispersibility was significantly correlated with organic C, hexose C, soluble hexose C, non-hexose C, CEC, and exchangeable Ca and Mg but was not correlated with total ASF clay. Long-term cultivation of this soil resulted in a decrease in the energy required to disperse an equivalent proportion of clay from aggregates relative to that of the grassland soil. Thus, cultivation of these soils has resulted in aggregates which are more susceptible to clay dispersion and therefore prone to water erosion and surface crusting.

AB To interpret climatic signatures from magnetic susceptibility (MS) in the Barton County loess-soil sequence, central Kansas, we tested the influence of particle size and carbonate concentration on magnetic susceptibility. First, sand, silt and clay were separated and MS was then measured on each of the three size fractions. To assess the influence of chemical treatments and carbonate on MS signals, the chemical agents used to remove carbonate, organic matter and free iron oxides were applied to another set of samples and MS was measured before and after each of the treatments. The results show that the bulk MS differentiates among stratigraphic units, but the environmental interpretation is far from straightforward. Soils have stronger MS signals than the loess units in the upper portion, while the carbonate-rich soils have weaker MS signals in the lower portion due to the MS dilution effect of carbonate. Sand MS peaks in Bignell Loess, Peoria loess and LL1 may suggest that in loess units fewer sand-sized magnetic minerals were changed by weathering processes into clay-sized magnetic minerals than in soils. A low bulk MS at the bottom of the reddish pedocomplex to the bottom of LS1 is attributable to a combination of a high sand content and a high carbonate concentration. The silt MS peak in the Barton sand might have been derived from the parent materials. Comparing with mineralogic and chemical indices, clay MS might be closer to being a proxy of weathering intensity. Although clay MS dominates the bulk MS signals, silt MS and sand MS affect the bulk MS signals in two ways: (1) changes in the percentages of silt and sand, and (2) mineralogical variations in silt MS and sand MS from one stratigraphic unit to another. This study demonstrates that 40% of the variation in the bulk MS is accounted for by the clay MS and 56% of the variation by the silt MS and clay MS together. After adding the sand MS, 66% of the variation is accounted for. If diamagnetic carbonate is taken into consideration, 76% of the variation in bulk MS is accounted for by the MS of the three size fractions and the MS dilute effect of carbonate.

AB Effects of millet stover residue (0,500, and 2000 kg ha-1) on wind erosion and surface soil properties were determined from 1991 to 1993 at teh ICRISAT Sahelian Center in Niger, West Africa. Soil flux 0.1 m above the ground was significantly reduced with 2000 kg ha-1 residue but not with 500 kg ha-1. Topographic measurements indicated that soil removed from the soil surface was less with either residue level than in the control. After 2 y, the soil surface (0-0.01 m) of both residue treatments had less coarse sand than the control, but more fine sand and clay, more organic carbon and an increased cation exchange capacity. The organic-C content of blown material was greater than that of surface soil. An amount of 500 kg ha-1 residue can be considered useful for soil conservation, but 2000 kg ha-1 are required for a significant reduction of soil flux caused during severe wind erosion events.

AB The beneficial effect of organic matter on soil aggregate stability is well documented. Alley cropping has been suggested as a possible alternative to maintain soil organic matter content in cropping systems without fallowing the land. The objective of this study was to asses the effect of alley cropping on dry and wet soil aggregate stability on land degraded by shifting cultivation. The aggregate size distribution by dry sieving, aggregate stability by wet sieving, soil organic Carbon content and soil bulk density were measured following two and three years of alley cropping with Gliricedia (Gliricidia sepium) and Pigeon pea (Cajanas cajan) in a tropical Rhodustalf. Alley cropping increased the mean aggregate diameter and water stability of soil aggregates. The mean aggregate diameter obtained from dry sieving increased from 1.3 mm of the control to 2.68 and 3.11 mm after three years in Pigeon pea and Gliricidia alley cropped plots, respectively. This is an indication of resistance to wind erosion in alley cropped plots. The wet aggregate stability which shows the resistance to erosion by water also increased in alley cropped plots. These increases were significant after three years of hedge row establishment. The increase in soil organic C in alley cropped plots contributed to the higher dry and wet aggregate stability, and decreased soil bulk density. The improvement was higher in plots alley cropped with Gliricidia than Pigeon pea. This study shows the importance of ally cropping in increasing aggregate stability of degraded sandy soils which in return reduce erosion by wind and water.

AB Soil organic matter and the abundance of subterranean termites were measured at 89 locations spaced at 30-m intervals from the bottom to the top of a small desert watershed. There was no correlation between soil organic matter content and topographic position on the watershed. Analysis by autocorrelogram demonstrated that the soil organic matter content was randomly distributed on the watershed. There was a highly significant negative correlation between termite abundance and soil organic matter, r = -0.97. Soils characterized by horizon in soil pits within each vegetation type (soil type) showed some relationships to erosion-deposition areas on the watershed, with surface organic matter contents varying between 3.4% in the playa basin where termites were absent to 0.4% in a sparse shrubland on erosional soils. In the northern Chihuahuan Desert, subterranean termites appear to be responsible for most of the variation in soil organic matter.

AB The main soil chemical constraints on agricultural production systems in the Amazon include soil acidity, phosphorus (P) deficiency, and low effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). About 80% of the Amazon has acid soils with pH values of less than 5.3 in the topsoil. Associated with soil acidity, is the problem of aluminum toxicity and phosphorus deficiency. The low soil ECEC of most Amazonian soils is also a major soil chemical constraint to plant productivity since the leaching of mobile nutrients (such as potassium) increases as ECEC decreases. Agroforestry systems have the potential to control erosion, maintain soil organic matter and soil physical properties, augment nitrogen fixation, and promote efficient cycling of the scarce nutrients in Amazonian soils. The rationale for supposing that agroforestry systems can alleviate the soil chemical constraints to food and fibre production is that the nutrient exports via the harvest of crop and animal products, erosion, leaching, volatilization, and the deterioration in soil physical properties due to cropping or grazing can be counteracted by the tree component via: 1) nutrient uptake by deep rooted trees allowing for capture and surface deposition via tree litter, of nutrients beyond the reach of crop roots (more efficient nutrient cycling), 2) increased amounts of organic (shoot and root) inputs to the soil help to maintain soil organic matter and thus improve soil structure and nutrient status, and 3) increased nutrient additions to the soil via nitrogen fixation.

AB Soils of the Argentine humid pampa region are usually weakly structured due to its high silt content. Selecting crop sequence or tillage systems are an alternative in small farms for the protection of the soil against physical degradation and erosion given that conservation practices, grass meadows, and fertilizers are expensive and therefore rarely used. Evaluation of selected soil properties was conducted on soil sampled from a long-term tillage experiment with continuous soybean established in 1975 on a Typic Argiudoll silty loam soil in Argentina. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage with moldboard plow (CT), chisel plow (CP), and no till (NT). A comparison with continuous corn under NT was also carried out. Sampling was performed after the emergence of both crops in 1990. Tillage and cropping treatments affected properties related to soil slacking and dispersion to a greater extent than they did on aggregate size distribution. According to the De Leenheer and De Boodt index, aggregate stability within soybean soil classified as bad for CT, unsatisfactory for CP, and very good for NT, whereas the soil with corn under NT classified as excellent. The no tillage treatment within soybean had significantly more organic carbon in the 0-5 cm depth than CP or CT. Soil respiration was significantly higher in NT than in CT in the surface layer, while CT showed higher values in the 10-15 cm depth. Tillage treatments did not significantly affect microbial biomass under soybean cropping. The effect of monoculture corn versus monoculture soybean under NT on soil respiration, biomass and organic carbon was not significant. Soil pH in the 0-5 cm depth under soybean was in the order NT > CP > CT, whereas the soil with corn under NT was more acid than the soybean soil (P=0.05). Cation exchange capacity and exchangeable bases followed a similar trend. Organic carbon (0-5 cm depth) and aggregate stability were significantly correlated when samples from all treatments were considered.

AB This research was designed to identify relationships between T-4464 buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) survival and climatic and soil characteristics.  At 167 buffelgrass seeding sites in North America we collected climatic and soils data where the grass:  1) persisted over time and increased in area covered (spreads), 2) persisted over time but does not increase in area covered (persists), and 3) declined over time and all plants eventually died (dies).  At 30 sites in Kenya we collected climatic and soils data in the area where T-4464 seed was originally collected.  Only total soil nitrogen and organic carbon differed among survival regimes.  Total soil nitrogen and organic carbon concentrations were least where buffelgrass spreads, intermediate where the grass persists and greatest where the grass dies.  To predict buffelgrass survival among the 3 survival regimes, and between areas where the grass spreads or dies, we used discriminant function analyses.  A model including organic carbon, total soil nitrogen, sand, clay, potassium and cation exchange capacity correctly classified 78% (r2 = 0.8) of the seeding sites in the 3 survival regimes.  A model including sand, total soil nitrogen, calcium, mean minimum temperature in the coldest month, annual precipitation and winter precipitation correctly classified 88% (r2 = 0.8) of the seeding sites between spreads and dies.  Survival regime selection prior to brush control, seedbed preparation and sowing will reduce planting failure probabilities, soil erosion and economic losses, and enhance long-term beef production.

ID GRASS BARRIERS
AB Tall wheatgrass barriers have been successfully tested in the northern Great Plains for wind erosion control and plant protection.  Our objective was to document the passive formation of hillside terraces occasioned by grass barriers on a variable 2 to 4% west to east slope.  Eleven double-row tall wheatgrass [Elytrigia elongata (Host) Nevski] barriers with 10 15-m-wide cropping intervals 530 m long were established in 1967 on a Williams loam (fine-loamy mixed, Typic Argiboroll) 11 km north of Culberton, Montana.  The barriers were oriented north and south in traditional field orientation.  In 1991 we established four transects 15 m apart across the barrier system and designated five sampling points along the transects in each cropping interval for a total of 200 sampling points.  To avoid confounding by slopes parallel to the barriers, we selected a segment of the barrier system on a near 0% north to south slope for the measurements.  Elevation was determined at each point, and soil cores were taken to a depth of about 90 cm to determine depth to CaCO3 layer, and to determine total and organic carbon by 5 cm increments.  A stair-step pattern, with a maximum drop of 30 cm from one grass barrier to an adjacent cropping interval, was documented.  Depth to CaCO3 and organic carbon concentration increased downslope between barriers, showing soil movement.  Grass barriers may serve as a substitute for mechanically built terraces.

AB An on-farm study was conducted on 4 sites (A, B, C and D) in Ohio to compare soil properties of the surface horizon of an uncultivated and non-eroded (NE) wooded soil with those of cultivated and eroded soils for the same series. Cultivated soil comprised of slight (S), moderate (M), severely (SV) eroded phases on upper landscape position and depositional (DP) phase on the foot slopes. There were significant differences in soil properties of surface horizon of the non-cultivated location (wooded site) compared with the cultivated locations. Mean soil bulk density of the NE sites was 1.03 Mg/m(3) compared with 1.40 Mg/m(3) for cultivated land. Among different erosion phases on cultivated land, the highest mean bulk density of 1.45 Mg/m(3) was observed on SV phases and the lowest bulk density of 1.33 Mg/m(3) on DP phases. Mean total porosity was 64.9% for NE sites compared with that of 46.7% for all cultivated sites. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) was highly variable and did not follow a consistent trend with regard to erosional phases. In general, however, laboratory measured K-s was significantly higher for NE sites than cultivated sites, e.g., 24.6 cm/hr vs. 5.29 cm/hr. Available water capacity (AWC) decreased with increasing severity of erosion among cultivated phases. The mean AWC was 0.33 (volumetric fraction) for NE, 0.23 for Df, 0.22 for S, 0.20 for M, and 0.19 for SV phase, Percentage water stable aggregation (WSA) and mean weight diameter (MWD) were generally high for NE and SV phases. Mean soil organic carbon (SOC) was 3.47% for NE, 1.13% for S, 0.98% for M, 0.97% for SV, and 1.45% for DP phases. Mean pH was 6.5 for NE, 6.4 for S 6.1 for M, 7.2 for SV and 6.8 for DP phase. The available P was significantly lower on NE compare with cultivated land for sites A and C. The mean P content for soil at site A was 16 kg/ha for NE, 41 kg/ha for S, 46 kg/ha for M, 32 kg/ha for SV, and 59 kg/ha for DP phase. Mean CEC was 12 cmol/kg for NE, 11 for S, 12 for M, 16 for SV, and 12 for DP phase.

ID PLATEAU; EPISODE
AB A 38-m well section near Lanzhou at the semiarid western margin of the Loess Plateau, China, contained a continuous, high-resolution loess-paleosol sequence spanning the last 130,000 yr. Depth functions of micromorphological features, magnetic susceptibility, calcium carbonate, organic carbon, and median grain size provide the basis for pedosedimentary and associated paleoenvironmental reconstructions of three paleosol complexes (S1, Sm, and S0). Each pedosedimentary stage reflects the interaction of changing intensities of controlling monsoonal forces. Three periods of reduced dust inputs and enhanced pedogenic activity, notably bioturbation and weak leaching, can be identified from within the S1 pedocomplex. These ''soil-forming intervals'' were separated by phases of varying land surface instability characterized by arid dust deposition, semiarid accretionary pedogenesis, water reworking, and crust formation, or even freeze-thaw modification. The Sm pedocomplex represents an interval of relatively rapid dust accumulation with only minimal syndepositional modification and minor pedogenic alteration at ephemeral land surfaces. The S0 pedocomplex is clearly more pedogenically developed, although erosion, reworking, and mixing by water have partly homogenized the property depth functions. (C) 1995 University of Washington.

ID PALEOSOLS
AB Hillslope deposits in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa are incised by gullies (dongas) which expose sequences of buried palaeosols developed within a succession of discontinuity-bounded colluvial sedimentary units.  Infilled and buried palaeogully topography attests to at least four geomorphic cycles, comprising gully cut-and-fill and palaeosol formation, on hillslopes in the region during the past 135 ka.  Past attempts at dating colluvial stratigraphic units were limited to radiocarbon dating of associated palaeosol organic matter and authigenic soil carbonates.  This study presents a preliminary set of Infra Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) age determinations pertaining to deposition of the succession of colluvial units infilling and burying palaeogullies at several sites of stratigraphic, geochronological and palaeo-environmental importance in the region.  Interpretation of the IRSL and C-14 dates in the context of cyclical hillslope processes suggests that past episodes of palaeogully erosion and infill were not synchronous and individual palaeosol landsurfaces were diachronous during the late Pleistocene.

AB Logging operations can cause soil profile disturbance and compaction. Soil profile disturbance and compaction change soil physical properties, which may reduce site productivity, increase soil erosion and degrade catchment water quality. This study was undertaken to measure the effect of logging on physical properties of the 0-100 mm surface soil in the Victorian Central Highlands, southeastern Australia. Soil physical properties were measured in the snig tracks, log landings, general logging areas (disturbed areas which were not occupied by snig tracks or log landings) and undisturbed areas. Within the general logging areas? measurements were made for three levels of soil profile disturbance: litter disturbed, topsoil disturbed and subsoil disturbed.
   The results indicated that logging significantly increased bulk density and decreased organic carbon and organic matter content, total porosity and macroporosity on over 72% of the coupe area. However, on 35% of the coupe area, the snig tracks, log landings and subsoil disturbed areas of the general logging area, bulk densities and macroporosities reached critical levels where tree growth could be affected. On these areas, organic carbon decreased between 27 and 66%, bulk density increased between 39 and 65% and macroporosity decreased between 58 and 88%.
   Saturated hydraulic conductivities decreased to critical levels for runoff to occur on over 72% of the coupe area (topsoil and subsoil disturbed areas of the general logging area, snig tracks and log landings). On this area, the reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity varied between 60 and 95%.

TI LANDSCAPE-SCALE CHANGES IN INDICATORS OF SOIL QUALITY DUE TO CULTIVATION
   IN SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA
SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
ID EROSION; MODEL
AB Quantitative assessments of the impact of agricultural practises on soil quality have been hindered by the lack of basic spatial units for designing landscape-scale research projects. This paper builds on the relationship which has been demonstrated to exist between small (5 m by 5 m) slope segments and soil distribution in order to define larger landform element complexes in till landscapes of southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Distinctive pedogenic regimes are associated with these complexes. These complexes were then used to stratify the landscape at four conterminous sites with different cultivation histories and to assess changes in indicators of soil quality. Soil redistribution (as assessed by Cs-137 redistribution) has had a major impact on these landscapes. The shoulder and level summit complexes have experienced continued high rates of soil loss. The shoulder complexes have lost 55% of their original soil organic carbon (a loss of 64 mg ha(-1)) over 80 years and 70% of this loss is attributable to net soil export from these positions. The portions of the footslope complexes dominated by Orthic Black Chernozemic soils initially act as sediment deposition sites in the first 22 years of cultivation, but ultimately this soil is removed from these positions and a moderate decline in soil quality occurs. The Gleysolic-dominated portions of the footslopes and the level depressional complexes occupy 15% of the landscape and are the major long-term sediment depositional sites; the biochemical indicators of soil quality (soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen) show a major and beneficial increase in these positions.

AB General guidelines to reclaim saline or sodic soils do not adequately consider variables such as pH and the presence of organic matter that are known to affect soil stability. Poor structural stability of sodic, saline-sodic, and high-pa soils adversely influences crop yields; promotes piping, tunneling, and slope erosion; and can accelerate the failure of water conveyance systems. We evaluated six soil tests, used to measure physico-chemical properties, for their suitability to evaluate the structural stability of a calcareous, saline-sodic soil under reclamation. The stability tests were wilting point, plastic limit, coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE(rod)), water content at 0.03 MPa, liquid limit, and dispersion index. The range of electrical conductivity (EC) studied was 0.5 to 20 dS m(-1), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) 0 to 400 (mmol L(-1))(0.5), and pH 8.4 to 10.5. The results obtained indicate that the amount of water necessary for a soil to how under standard conditions for the liquid limit test decreased an average of 25% when the EC decreased from 40 to 2 dS m(-1). The liquid limit and EC showed a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.785); therefore, the liquid limit was considered to be an appropriate index to evaluate the physical properties of a soil under a leaching process. Plasticity index and available cater were more useful in the evaluation of the mechanical properties of the soil when we used amendments. Liquid limit combined with the water content of the soil at 0.03 MPa was the most useful tool for evaluating soil structural stability during reclamation.

AB Adoption of reduced or no-tillage practices on a large scale depends on the maintenance of a favorable soil environment for crop growth in addition to providing a sustained protection against soil erosion. We evaluated the changes in soil aggregation status (0-5 cm) and in other physical and chemical properties (0-15 cm) of a Malmo clay loam (Typic Cryoboroll, Black Chernozemic) subjected to three tillage and residue management systems after nine years in central Alberta with a subhumid temperate climate. The soil was cropped to spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) each year. The treatments included: no tillage, straw retained on the surface; tillage, straw incorporated into surface soil; and tillage, straw removed. Tillage consisted of two rotocultivations to a depth of 10 cm, one in late fall and another in spring before seeding. In the no till + straw treatment, the crop was directly seeded with a hoe drill.
   The no till + straw treatment provided 70 to 99% residue cover, followed by till + straw (41 to 85%) and till + no straw (6 to 14%). Tillage significantly increased the soil surface roughness, while seasonal rainfall greatly reduced it. Although the no till + straw treatment had a smaller surface roughness, it would provide more effective and sustained runoff and erosion control owing to its greater residue cover and a greater amount of larger water-stable aggregates. This treatment had significantly greater organic carbon content, lower pH, lower particle density and greater electrical conductivity in the 0-5-cm soil depth interval compared with the tilled treatments. The differences among treatments became less pronounced with depth. For the surface soil of the no till + straw treatment, the proportion of wind erodible (< 1 mm) and water-slakable micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm) was also smaller, and mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter greater compared to the tilled treatments. Soil structural stability increased due to straw addition and a better aggregate size distribution occurred due to a reduction in soil disturbance.

AB A group of specialists was asked by the Environmental Protection Agency to use their judgment as to which soil variables would be most impacted by five scenarios of climatic change in deserts of North America that could occur over the next 40 years.  The following soil characteristics were evaluated in terms of their potential for change:  physical, chemical, and biological crusts; the vesicular layer; soil organic matter; organic C and N content; the C/N ratio; carbonate pool; inorganic N, P, and S; salinity levels; micro-element content; microbial community composition; free-living microbial N fixation; denitrification; ammonia volatilization; salinization rates; water infiltration; evaporation; lateral flow and leaching; wind and water erosion; and litter decomposition.  The Delphi approach was used to reach consensus on expected trends.  Computer modeling was used to integrate and project interactive changes.  We expect physical and chemical crusting, vesicularity, ammonium volatilization, soil erosion, and salt accumulation to increase and microphytic crusts to decrease under all scenarios of climatic change.  Both soil organic C and N will decline, especially under increased temperatures, whereas the C/N ratio will decline to its lowest range of possible values.  Both free and symbiotic N fixation should decline unless there is a shift to greater absolute precipitation during summers.  Only slight changes in soil P, S, and trace element contents are expected under any of the five scenarios of climatic change.  Production of litter will change relatively little, but its chemical quality will decrease and nutrient cycling will be accelerated when the vegetation shifts from perennials to annuals.  Use of the Century Model showed that soil organic matter is more sensitive to temperature changes than precipitation.  Indicators of desert ecosystem ''health'' that we identified are relatively low albedo, patchiness of plant cover and interspace (trend depends on context), changes in drainage patterns and microrelief, biological crusting, and ratios of microbial biomass C to total organic C.  Need for further research is outlined.

AB This paper presents an attempt to integrate methods of landscape regionalization and already established model approaches which describe the soil water budget, the dynamics of soluble and adsorbed substances as well as the different processes of the soil nitrogen budget. This integration leads to the Catchment Related Water & Substance Simulation System (CWSS), which gives the ability to carry out simulations for the area of small catchments. CWSS is a modular process-based system that simulates the soil water and ground water dynamics, surface runoff, soil heat budget and organic carbon and nitrogen transformation processes. It gives the ability to calculate water and substance budgets for a number of landscape cells, determined by the heterogeneity of soil conditions, elevation and landuse. Water and substance inputs into creeks, rivers and lakes concerning to the catchment area can be simulated with a high temporal resolution. There are many scientific and management applications, for which this system could be used. For example it could help address ecological issues like eutrophication, effects of global warming, water management and soil erosion. Methods of parameter estimation and procedures concerning the regional aspects of soil variability, elevation and landuse conditions are described. The combination with a geographical information system (GIS) and the deduction of input values from various data sets, which are available all over the country, are described. Some simulation results related to the catchment of Lake Belau (north Germany) will be discussed. In this area nitrate concentrations of ground water exceed the legal limit for drinking water (50 mg NO3/l) and a high degree of eutrophication characterizes the lake.

AB Ninety years after the start of the Askov long-term fertilization experiment on sandy loam, bulk soil was taken from the 0-20 cm and 30-35 cm depths of unfertilized (UNF), animal-manure (FYM) treated and mineral-fertilized (NPK) plots and analysed for textural composition, carbon content, pH, CEC, particle density and plasticity limits.  Undisturbed soil cores (100 cm3) from the 8-12 cm layer were brought to six different matric potentials and subjected to confined uniaxial compression, drop-cone penetration and annulus shear tests.  Water-retention curves based on seven matric potentials were produced for undisturbed cores from the 8-12 and 30-35 cm layers.  In the field, in situ shear strength of plough-layer soil was determined by a vane shear tester and a torsional shear box.
   FYM and NPK treatments increased the soil organic carbon content by 23 and 11% of the amount in UNF, respectively.  Corresponding increases observed in CEC were 17 and 11%.  The water content at the lower and upper plastic limits both decreased from FYM to NPK to UNF.  Soil bulk density in the 0-20 cm layer was reduced in FYM and NPK treatments relative to UNF, whereas the volume of soil pores larger than 30 mum was unaffected by past fertilization.
   Soil receiving animal manure showed the greatest soil strength when exposed to annulus shear, drop-cone penetration and confined uniaxial compression tests.  Shear strength measurements indicated that the UNF sandy loam soil reacted like a sand, the increase in soil strength upon drying primarily being due to increased internal friction.  In contrast, soil from FYM and NPK treatments showed reactions typical of a loamy soil, the increase in soil strength during drying being caused by increased cohesion in the soil matrix.  The field tests employed were unable to detect the management-induced differences in soil physical parameters found in the laboratory tests.
   This study shows that physical soil properties related to conditions for tillage and traffic, to crop development and erosion are significantly influenced by differences in soil organic matter levels resulting from contrasting methods of fertilizer management.  Exhausting a loamy soil by long-term lack of fertilizer application severely affects the physical properties of the soil.

AB Stability of aggregates at the immediate soil surface affects the detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles. The aggregate stability (expressed as mean weight diameter, MWD) and erosion rate were tested for clayey surface soils at two different water contents. The soils consisted of six Oxisols, one Ultisol, three Vertisols, one Alfisol, and one Aridisol. The MWD was determined by wet sieving of 4.76 to 8.00 aggregates, which were either air-dried (MWD(d)) or capillary prewetted at -0.5 kPa for 24 h (MWD(w)). Air-dried and prewetted (saturated from the bottom up for 2 h) soils were subjected to a 110-mm h-1 rain until a steady-state infiltration was reached. Runoff, sediment loss, and infiltration (for prewetted soil only) were monitored throughout the rain. The MWD(d) ranged from 0.18 to 4.80 mm, and the MWD(w) ranged from 0.44 to 5.66 mm. Prewetting increased the MWD for the oxidic or kaolinitic Oxisols and Ultisols and for one smectitc/kaolinitic Vertisol. The MWD(w) was positively related to CEC for highly weathered soils and negatively related for swelling soils, whereas base saturation was negatively related for both groups of soils. The DELTAMWD, which expresses the increase in stability caused primarily by a decrease in slaking, was greatest for soils rich in kaolinite and Fe and Al oxyhydroxides and low in organic carbon. The steady-state infiltration rate (I(s)) ranged from 1.8 (illitic soil) to 54.8 mm h-1 (sandy loam kaolinitic soil). The I(s) was consistently less for swelling than for highly weathered soils, and it was related to the sand/clay ratio, sand, and water retained between -33 and -1500 kPa. The increased aggregate stability with prewetting was generally not reflected in smaller amounts of erosion and runoff, possibly because of the faster rate of wetting than for the stability test, a higher water table for the prewetted soil than for the air-dried soil, and the inclusion of smaller aggregates in the erosion tests. Prewetting decreased the time to ponding for three highly weathered Oxisols and the illitic Alfisol, increased steady-state runoff rate (Q(w)) for five highly weathered soils, increased sediment loss rate (Q(s)) for the illitic and for one highly weathered soil, and increased Q(s) on a stable Oxisol. Soil textural properties (usually clay and sand/clay) and ''binding'' agents (organic carbon and Fe and Al oxyhydroxides) were the significant independent variables included in the stepwise multiple linear regressions for I(s), Q(s), and Q(w).

ID CROP PRODUCTION; ILLINOIS SOILS; TOPSOIL; THICKNESS
AB The productive capacity of a soil is often related to the chemical properties inherent in that soil. Erosion removes topsoil and exposes subsoil thereby changing the characteristic productivity of soils. An eight-state cooperative research project studied 15 soils subjected to varying degrees of natural or artificial erosion. Selected chemical properties for slightly, moderately, or severely eroded soils are reported for the Ap horizon for these soils and for depth to CaCO3 accumulation and NO3-N accumulation in the upper profile. For most soils, erosion resulted in increases in pH and exchangeable Ca++ and K+. Decreases were noted in organic carbon, depth to CaCO3 accumulation, profile NO3-N, extractable P, CEC, and DTPA extractable-Zn, Fe and Mn. Mixed results were observed for base saturation, exchangeable Mg++ and Na+, and extractable K+.

TI COMPUTING THE WIND ERODIBLE FRACTION OF SOILS
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Chepil, Woodruff, and Siddoway, developers of the wind erosion equation (WEQ), suggest that the wind erodible fraction of any soil can be determined by dry sieving a sample of the surface soil.  The data base of soil information for the wind erosion equation was primarily from the Central Great Plains.  As other areas used the WEQ, questions about the erodible fraction based on soil texture alone began to surface.  To test soils outside the Great Plains, more than 3,000 samples have been sieved to identify the relationships between the erodible fraction of soils and the physical and chemical properties of the soil.
   From these results, the erodible fraction was computed from the percentage of sand, percentage of silt, sand/clay ratio, organic carbon, and calcium carbonate.  A correlation coefficient of 0.82 was obtained between computed erodible fraction using soil physical and chemical properties with average measured erodible fraction from standard compact rotary sieving from sites with at least 20 samples.  The erodible fraction of dryland soils was reduced an average of 14% and of irrigated soils 24% with moldboard plowing.

SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION

DT Article
ID NITROGEN; YIELD; PLANT; FLOW
AB The level of organic matter or carbon in agricultural soils depends on additions from crop residues and manures and on losses from erosion and decomposition.  The supply of C to soils is dependent on biomass yields, harvest index, and the proportion of feed C retained in the manure with different crops.  A simple mathematical procedure was used to estimate quantities of C supplied to the soil with different livestock systems.  This procedure involved the partitioning of C into residue, root, and animal components.  There were uncertainties, however, about the quantities of C originating from crop roots and C losses during manure storage.  Two typical livestock farm systems were compared; a swine system emphasizing grain crops, and a dairy system with grain and forage crops each in a typical rotation.  This study revealed that manure contributes a relatively small proportion of the C to soil compared to crop roots and residue, especially in swine systems, unless straw bedding is included.  The total quantity of C supplied to the soil was generally greater with the dairy system, primarily because of the inclusion of a legume/grass crop in the rotation.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is valuable, because of both its beneficial effect on soil quality and crop productivity and its potential to sequester C. Long-term experiments provide an opportunity to identify crop management practices that enhance or degrade soil quality. This study was initiated in 1931 to determine residue management effects on crop yield and SOM (organic C and N) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow system. The soil is a coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Haploxeroll. Treatments include (units ha-1 crop-1) 22.4 Mg manure, 2.24 Mg pea vine residue, 0, 45, and 90 kg N with and without spring burning of straw, and 0 kg N with fall burning of straw. Yearly C and N inputs and removals have been determined since 1976, and calculated for prior periods. Soil C and N have been determined at almost-equal-to 11-yr intervals. Manure, which supplies 111 kg N ha-1 crop-1, has consistently produced the highest yield and maintained the highest soil C and N contents. Other treatments initially yielded from 80 to 90% of the manure treatment, but have progressively declined in direct relation to decreasing soil N content. Low-fertility treatments currently yield from 43 to 57% of the manure treatment. The change in soil C and N with time is nearly linear for all treatments, and highly correlated with residue input. Treatment effects on soil C and N have been confined to the top 30 cm of soil, but there has been a slow steady decline in C and N in the 30- to 60-cm zone that is not related to residue management.

TI METAL CONTAMINATION DUE TO MINING AND MILLING ACTIVITIES AT THE ZAWAR
   ZINC MINE, RAJASTHAN, INDIA .1. CONTAMINATION OF STREAM SEDIMENTS
SO CHEMICAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRACE-METALS; COPPER; SOILS; CADMIUM; SPECIATION
AB Ancient base-metal mining activity at Zawar has produced widespread and persistent dispersal of metals by the Tiri river, flowing past the region. With heavy input of mine and tailing water, the river sediments are enriched with heavy metals compared to the background sediments. Samples collected from the river bed have been analysed for Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Ca and Mg to recognise the extent of contamination and the geochemical process of dispersion.
   The river sediment is a mixture of natural erosional detritals, tailing discharges from the milling plant and hydrogenous precipitates. Besides the detrital carbonates derived from the dolomitic litho unit of the area, a significant amount of carbonate is likely to precipitate on the river bed due to influx of mine water. Correlation matrix and R-mode factor analyses revealed that coprecipitation of metals along with Fe-Mn-hydroxides is significant. Association of metals with the precipitated carbonates is by adsorption under alkaline to neutral pH conditions. Cu has poor association with the other heavy metals but has a strong affinity with the gross lithology of the sediments (i.e. Ca-Mg and Fe-Mn in the second factor).
   The heavy-metal concentrations are extremely variable in the sediments and have been recognised by several approaches such as: (a) extraction at pH 3; (b) total dissolution of sediment samples for bulk heavy-metal analysis; and (c) sequential chemical extraction.
   Geochemical partitioning of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd into exchangeable, carbonate, organic, multiple hydroxide and lithogenic pools (operationally defined by A. Tessier) has been brought out utilising a sequential chemical extraction scheme. Nondetrital carbonates are found to be the most efficient scavengers of Pb, Zn and Cd, whereas Cu goes for organics. The results emphasize the importance of the precipitated carbonates and organics as sinks for the heavy metals, even in presence of a high concentration of multiple hydroxides.
   Of all the metals, Cd appears to be the most mobile element and Zn has preferentially accumulated more in the sediments. The apparent mobility and potential bioavailability of the metals have been found to be in the order of Cd > Pb > Zn > Cu.

ID EROSION; SASKATCHEWAN; CS-137
AB The cumulative extent of soil redistribution by erosion and tillage was measured by comparing the Cs-137 content of a soil under intensive potato production with that of an undisturbed forest soil. Soil redistribution rates estimated from Cs-137 contents for the cultivated site varied from a loss of as high as 19.0 kg m-2 year-1 (190 t ha-1 year-1) to a gain of as much as 4.3 kg m-2 year-1 (43 t ha-1 year-1), with an average of 5.3 kg m-2 year-1 (53 t ha-1 year-1) soil loss. Measured soit Cs-137 content and calculated soil loss (and deposition) were both found to be correlated with total potato yield (P<0.01), and with tuber specific gravity (P<0.05), in the two years of yield measurements (1991 and 1992). These years had near normal growing season precipitation, but contrasting distribution patterns of precipitation during the growing season. Estimated soil loss and gain were also correlated (P<0.01) with soil organic carbon and soil phosphorus contents. It is concluded that soil redistribution within the site, caused by either water erosion or tillage, or a combination of both these processes, had a marked effect on soil productivity.

AB The influence of trees on soil characteristics beneath and around the sub-canopy area has been well established in tropical and temperature regions.  A hypothesis may be inferred which predicts an amelioration of the soil between the tree canopies as a function of increased canopy cover.  This hypothesis has been tested at two sites in open vegetation dominated by Acacia tortilis trees and shrubs.  Three different canopy cover classes were used as independent variables whereas all other soil-forming factors (Jenny, 1941) (such as climate, parent material, slope, and time) were relatively uniform within each site.  The hypothesis was refuted at one side and verified at the other by means of ANOVA and Canonical Variate Analysis.  Total nitrogen and organic carbon increased and the C/N-ratio decreased as the canopy cover increased in the latter site.  Here a lower pH (CaCl2) correlated with high organic carbon.  At the site where the hypothesis was verified the number of individual tree and shrubs was higher and the size was smaller compared to the other site.  This structural difference may influence the effect of wind erosion and is suggested as an explanation of the discrepancy in results.

TI EFFECT OF ARACHIS-PINTOI GROUNDCOVER ON PERFORMANCE OF BANANAS IN

AB Legume groundcovers have been promoted for controlling soil erosion in hillside banana plantations in northern New South Wales. An experiment was conducted at Alstonville to determine the effect of an Arachis pintoi (Pinto peanut) groundcover on banana productivity.
   The Arachis groundcover was slow to establish in the first year, but thereafter grew vigorously. While standing dry matter of groundcover was reduced at closer banana plant spacings, it was always more than adequate to control erosion. After 5.5 years many soil chemical parameters had been significantly affected by the presence of groundcover. Organic carbon concentrations to 30 cm depth were 5.6% greater on the groundcover plots (3.94 v. 3.71%), and total nitrogen was 8.5% greater (0.42 v. 0.39%). Other increases were exchangeable potassium 52%, calcium 26%, magnesium 43%, sodium 23%, electrical conductivity 24%, and pH 0.13 units. Banana leaf nutrient concentrations were not affected.
   Banana plants with groundcover produced 9% fewer bunches than their bare soil counterparts, with 4% fewer fingers per bunch. By the end of the experiment, fingers on the groundcover treatment were 9% lighter; consequently, the weight of marketable fruit (i.e. >120 g/finger) per bunch was reduced by 31% in the final year. The presence of groundcover reduced total fruit production over the whole trial by 16% and marketable fruit by 19%. In the last year of the experiment, total fruit production was reduced by 25%, and marketable fruit production by 40%. Over the whole trial, banana plants with groundcover produced 22% fewer suckers than the bare soil controls, with most of the effect occurring in the first 2 years.
   Soil temperatures at 20 cm under groundcover were as much as 0.7 degrees C cooler than the controls in October-January, but similar for the rest of the year. This effect possibly contributed to decreased yields. Although the experiment was irrigated, the irrigation was possibly inadequate for the groundcover treatment, and competition for water between the Arachis and banana plants may also have been responsible for part of the yield depression. Rats fed on the buried Arachis seed each winter.

AB The incidence and severity of water repellency was related to five soil class (FC I-V), based on the field texture and dry consistence of the soil surface horizons, derived from a soil survey near Jerramungup, Western Australia. Water repellency was most severe on the FC I soils (median clay content 1.5%), with 66% of samples having water repellency based on the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test >10 s. Corresponding values for the FC II and III soils (2.5%, 4.0% clay) were 37% and 20%. Water repellency did not occur on the most clayey FC IV (8.1% clay) and FC V (22.1% clay) soils.
   Following stratification of Ap horizon soils by 1% increments of clay content, highly significant linear relationships occurred between log [water drop penetration time (WDPT)] and log [organic carbon (OC)] for the 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4% clay classes, these respectively explaining 50, 35 and 37% of the variation in water repellency. The role of organic carbon in promoting water repellency decreases markedly with increasing clay content, with WDPT being proportional to OC4.5, OC3.9 and OC3.0 for each of these clay classes. A multivariate relationship using measures of amorphous iron, clay and organic matter explained 63% of the variation in water repellency, and this multivariate dependency provides an explanation of the poor bivariate relationships between either clay or organic carbon content and water repellency reported in previous studies.
   There is a strong geomorphic control of the clay content in the soil surface horizons. Given the effect that clay content has on water repellency, the susceptibility of soils to water repellency can be mapped across farms, with the actual expression of water repellency depending on soil organic matter content, and hence land use. Such discrimination will allow the prediction of water erosion hazard and identify soils requiring ameliorative treatments.

TI EVALUATION OF THE CS-137 TECHNIQUES FOR ESTIMATING WIND EROSION LOSSES

AB The utility of the caesium-137 (Cs-137) technique, for estimating the effects of wind erosion, was evaluated on the soils of a semi-arid agricultural area near Jerramungup, Western Australia.  The past incidence of wind erosion was estimated from field observations of soil profile morphology and an existing remote sensing study.  Erosion was limited to sandy surfaced soils (0-4% clay), with a highly significant difference (P < 0.0001) in Cs-137 values between eroded and non-eroded sandy soils, with mean values of 243+/-17 and 386+/-13 Bq m-2 respectively.  Non-eroded soils, with larger clay contents, had a mean Cs-137 content of 421+/-26 Bq m-2, however, due to considerable variation between replicate samples, this value was not significantly different from that of the non-eroded sands.  Hence, although the technique discriminates between eroded and non-eroded areas, the large variation in Cs-137 values means that from 27 to 96 replicate samples are required to provide statistically valid estimates of Cs-137 loss.
   The occurrence of around 18% of the total Cs-137 between 10 and 20 cm depth in these soils, despite cultivation being confined to the surface 9 cm, suggests that leaching of Cs-137 occurs in the sandy soils, although there was no relationship between clay content and Cs-137 value for either eroded or non-eroded soils.  In a multiple linear regression, organic carbon content and the mean grain size of the eroded soils explained 35% of the variation in Cs-137 content.  This relationship suggests that both organic carbon and Cs-137 are removed by erosion, with erosion being more prevalent on soils with a finer sand fraction.  Clay and silt contents do not vary with depth in the near-surface horizons of the eroded sandy soils, hence it is likely that wind erosion strips the entire surface horizon with its Cs-137 content, rather than selectively winnowing fine material.

AB The objective of this research was to determine the effects of tillage systems on selected chemical properties of a sloping and eroded soil which had previously been in sod. A tillage project was initiated in the spring, 1989 in southern Illinois on a soil with a root-restricting fragipan. Com (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were grown on the plot area on a yearly rotation system. Prior to the application of lime or tillage treatments the 0-15 cm Ap horizon had a pH of 6.3, organic carbon (C) of 1.4 g/100 g, and CEC equal to 17 meq/100 g. Lime had been surface applied early in the spring of 1989 prior to moldboard (MP) and chisel (CP) plowing. Moldboard plowing had lower pH than the other treatments in the 0-5 cm layer in 1989 due to the moldboard plow mixing low pH subsoil material into the 0-5 cm layer and mixing surface applied lime into the 5-15 cm layer. During the 4th year, organic C was lowest for MP (1.28 g/100 g) and highest for no tillage (NT) (1.65 g/100 g), with CP having organic C content of 1.52 g/100 g in the 0-5 cm layer. The differences in organic C were attributed to the effects of incorporation of plant residues below the 0-5 cm layer in the moldboard and chisel plow treatments. Effects of tillage on organic C content were not significant in the 5-15 cm layer. Soil phosphorus (P) (Bray Pl) and extractable potassium (K) were stratified, with the largest amounts of these two elements found within the top 5 cm of soil. In general, tillage did not have any significant (P=0.05) effect on either extractable calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg). Differences were observed in exchangeable ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) by tillage treatments and were affected by soil moisture content and previous crop residues. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) was lower for MP at the 0-5 cm layer as compared to NT and CP in the 3rd year. At the 5-15 cm layer CEC was lower for NT as compared to CP and MP. The differences in CEC were attributed to the observed differences in organic C and possibly the effects of moldboard and chisel plow mixing subsoil materials slightly higher in clay content into the Ap horizon.
   In 1989, com grain yield for NT was significantly lower than MP and CP. In 1990, 1991 and 1992 the crop yields by tillage treatment were not significantly different. Any conversion of conservation reserve land from sod into NT corn and soybean production could experience similar management problems and corn yield reductions the first year. The initial yield advantage MP system had the 1st year did not occur the last three years. Based on four years of observation, no-till and chisel plow systems may better maintain long-term productivity of sloping soils than moldboard plow systems because of changes in distribution and availability of nutrients and organic C in the 0-5 cm layer, reduced soil erosion, and yield trends.

AB Heat-induced changes in the soil-solution and post-wildfire erosion can create chemically and texturally diverse seedbed microsites. We quantified organic carbon, extractable NH4+ after incubation (aerobic and anaerobic), and emergence of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), by particle size fractions, in unburned and simulated burned sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata Nutt.) subcanopy soil. For all particle size fractions, significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) more extractable NH4+ and significantly less extractable NO3- were measured in heated material as compared to unheated material. Heated treatments had significantly more NH4+ and significantly less NO3- mineralized after 11 days aerobic incubation than after unheated treatments; net N mineralized tended to be higher for all particle fractions in heated treatments than in unheated treatments. Emergence of cheatgrass under aerobic conditions was significantly retarded in all heated treatments. Elevated NH4+ to NO3- ratios in the soil-solution following heating does not explain suppression of cheatgrass emergence. Nitrogen mineralization, before and after simulated burning, is adequate in all particle size fractions to support the needs of germinating seeds. Nitrogen mineralization was not enhanced by the presence of growing cheatgrass plants.

AB Forest floor samples from early. intermediate and mature successional sites in the taiga of interior Alaska were exposed to C-14-labeled glucose and two phenolic acids. Our results indicate that microbes present in the taiga forest floor metabolized phenolics. At all sites, biomass incorporation of glucose as measured by the fumigation extraction technique was approximately twice that for the phenolics, while respiration of (CO2)-C-14 was significantly higher for the phenolic compounds. Major differences in C-14 allocation were seen even between phenolic compounds with similar structures. Despite large differences in litter and forest floor composition, the metabolism of our model compounds varied only slightly between successional stages. Seasonal and successional effects were considerably less than those arising from substrate quality with variation greater in the uplands (where succession is fire-dominated) than in the floodplains (where river erosion and deposition are the controlling factors). Any physiological variation in microbial communities through succession must therefore be in organisms which produce exoenzymes that break down primary polymers, rather than in organisms and pathways that use the monomer breakdown products.

AB A seven-year tillage trial was conducted in central New South Wales, Australia to measure the effect and extent of conservation tillage practices on soil physical and chemical properties. Three tillage treatments, traditional tillage (TT), reduced tillage (RT) and direct drilling (DD) were imposed on hardsetting red-brown earths at Cowra and Grenfell. A fourth treatment, direct drilling without grazing (NT) was imposed at Cowra only.
   At Cowra there was a significant trend of reduced total runoff in the DD and NT treatments but not in the RT treatment. Runoff significantly increased in the TT treatment.
   At Grenfell, runoff decreased in all treatments but only significantly in the DD and RT treatments. Similar trends in total sediment loss were measured at both sites.
   Associated physical measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity, sorptivity and bulk density confirmed that the changes in runoff were due to the creation of macroporosity greater than 0.75 mm diameter. The relationship between macroporosity, organic carbon and aggregate stability is discussed. Conclusions were that in these soil types runoff and sediment loss were affected more by destruction of macroporosity due to cultivation than changes in organic carbon from residue retention. To achieve these soil improvements using conservation tillage a continuous cropping period of four years was necessary to obtain significant and consistent trends.
   Soil chemical data showed that total nitrogen increased with conservation tillage practices. Available phosphorus changes due to tillage were not observed because of more than adequate fertiliser applied. Soil pH decreased significantly in the DD and NT treatments at Cowra only. The implications of these chemical changes are discussed.

AB Atmospheric C (TAC) is continuously transported by rivers at the continents' surface as soil dissolved and particulate organic C (DOC, POC) and dissolved inorganic C (DIC) used in rock weathering reactions. Global typology of the C export rates (g.m-2.yr-1) for 14 river classes from tundra rivers to monsoon rivers is used to calculate global TAC flux to oceans estimated to 542 Tg.yr-1, of which 37 % is as DOC, 18 % as soil POC and 45 % as DIC. TAC originates mostly from humid tropics (46 %) and temperate forest and grassland (31 %), compared to boreal forest (14 %), savannah and sub-arid regions (5 %), and tundra (4 %). Rivers also carry to oceans 80 Tg. yr-1 of POC and 137 TG.yr-1 of DIC originating from rock erosion. Permanent TAC storage on land is estimated to 52 Tg.yr-1 in lakes and 17 Tg.yr-1 in internal regions of the continents.

AB In loamy Hapludalfs and sandy Haplorthods under forest and cultivation, the annual C, Al and Fe balances are presented in order to indicate element transfer into the subsoil. Aluminium and iron in the soil solution are separated into inorganic and organic fractions. In the Typic Hapludalf under forest initial podzolization is documented by an increase in Al release, its translocation into the subsoil and soil acidification. The Al3+ concentration is 2.7 mg l-1 and probably phytotoxic. The Hapludalfs under cultivation are influenced by stagnant water and the main part of iron is translocated in iron-organic complexes from the Bt into the subsoil. The aluminium release and transfer is minimal. In one Hapludalf erosion hinders an accumulation of humus, in spite of a C surplus. Extensive soil management in the forest and intensive cultivation without application of manure are incompatible with soil protection. In a Typic Haplorthod under spruce, podzolization is documented by the translocation of carbon and especially aluminium. A low pH induces weathering of soil minerals with a high release of Al3+ and its translocation into the subsoil. Its concentration in the topsoil is extremely phytotoxic. In a similar Typic Haplorthod under cultivation the carbon and metal sink (Bh/Bhs) is being decomposed and has become a source of carbon and iron-organic complexes; these are translocated into the subsoil. The natural accumulation process has been reversed by man.

TI SOME GEOCHEMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR
   ACCIDENT
SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Chernobyl nuclear accident took place on 1986-04-26, and resulted in radionuclide pollution of vast regions of Byelorussia. This has raised several geochemical problems: (1) investigation of the distribution and behaviour of radionuclides in the natural and technogenic landscapes (which were examined as a result of a 5-a study); (2) modes of occurrence of radioactive elements in the environment; and (3) preliminary estimation of radionuclide migration in the future. As background information. geochemical studies carried out within Byelorussia, as well as landscape investigations in the period 1953-1987 made under the guidance of K. 1. Lukashev were very important for solving the above questions. According to the results of these investigations, the lithogeochemical and hydrogeochemical zoning of Byelorussia is understood and the radioactive background of the republic was studied in the 1960s, as well as the distribution and peculiarities of clay minerals, carbonates, Fe-Mn oxides, organic matter, pH-Eh. and the contents of many elements in the surficial deposits of Byelorussia. All these factors arc of great importance for understanding the behaviour of radionuclides.
   Radionuclide fallout on Byelorussia in the first days after the accident was mainly dependent on the mass movement of air and rain. In cities, fallout was confined to regions with intensive industrial dust emissions, as well as to river valleys, where degassing of deep-seated zones through faults occurred side by side with evaporation. Radionuclide washout from upland territories can be related to secondary processes.
   After 5 a, the radioactive emission near the surface of the Earth decreased due to the decay of short-lived isotopes and penetration of radionuclides deeper into the soil, although the major part still occurs at a depth of 1-5 cm. Bogs, peat-bog soils, aquifers with fluctuating groundwater levels, variable pH-Eh conditions and a high biological activity are all factors contributing to radionuclide migration in the Byelorussian landscape. A part of the radionuclides is gradually removed from eluvial landscapes and accumulated in subareal landscapes (e.g. lakes, oxbow-lakes, water-storage basins).
   The Chernobyl debris are represented by the following substances: ''hot'' particles, pseudocolloids, aerosols and gaseous compounds. Study of the modes of occurrence of radionuclides by different methods (e.g. extracts, sorbents) made it possible to estimate the migration capacity of some radionuclides (Cs, Sr, Ce, Ru), and to distinguish two zones around the reactor-the nearest and remote ones-differing in the ratio of ''hot'' particles and condensate fallout, which causes a different migration capacity of radionuclides.
   A very important part is assigned to biological processes and organic matter, which cause the destruction of 'hot'' particles, the formation of organometallic complexes, and water migration of nuclides.
   In the future (within 300 and more years), the redistribution of radionuclides in the landscape involves processes of weathering, erosion and sedimentation which will strongly depend on climatic conditions. Side by side with a gradual decay of Cs and Sr, an appreciable accumulation of Am-241, which is very mobile in landscapes, should be expected due to decaying Pu-241.
   A considerable development of scientific and applied exploration should also be expected in the future and this will help in solving problems of radioactive pollution of landscapes.

AB The 1987 National Resources Inventory (NRI) was used to provide a random sample of 100 Illinois cropland sites growing corn and soybeans. These were used with the Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model to simulate responses of soil erosion and nutrient exports to several different tillage and crop rotation practices.  The NRI and other data sources were used for site specific characterizations that reflected the multidimensional variability in site conditions in Illinois. Four alternative management schemes were simulated for each site:  continuous corn and soybean/corn rotations under conventional tillage and no-till. Average crop yields varied little under the four management schemes and closely corresponded to expected yields from the SCS Soils-5 Soil Interpretation Records. However, no-till significantly reduced soil erosion rates and loss of soil organic carbon compared to conventional tillage.  This reduced erosion under no-till also led to reduced losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in eroded soil. Percolation below the root zone represented the greatest N export and is of concern for the issue of groundwater contamination in this region. Nitrate N concentrations in percolate substantially exceeded the drinking water standard of 10 mg/l. Soybean/corn rotations generally bad 10-30 percent lower soluble N losses in surface runoff, subsurface flow, and percolation than the corresponding conventional tillage or no-till practices under continuous corn. No-till resulted in a 24 percent increase in soluble N runoff losses compared to conventional tillage in soybean/corn rotations. P losses in surface runoff were larger under no-till, likely as a result of the lack of immediate incorporation of surface P fertilizer into the soil. The model predictions for changes in soil erosion and N and P losses under different management practices were in line with measured changes in site-specific field studies under similar conditions. Our study results take into account the effect of site-to-site variability on the responses and the relative frequency of different site conditions state-wide.  This indicates the potential magnitude for changes in nonpoint source pollution by sediment, N, and P state-wide by adoption of alternative corn and soybean tillage and rotation schemes.

   CONTENT
AB Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role in maintaining tropical soil fertility. Its conservation and maintenance in tropical cultivation systems is imperative if soil degradation is to be halted and cropping made sustainable. Around 22-23% of global carbon is present in tropical ecosystems but only 2-3% of this is present in the soil. Fluxes of CO2 to the atmosphere from tropical soils after deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect and could represent a 1-4% increase in the overall steady-state annual CO2 release to the atmosphere.
   The composition of SOM is extremely diverse, with active, or labile, fractions decomposing in a matter of months while the more resistant, or nonlabile, fractions remain in soil for many years. SOM plays a central role in providing good soil structure, in supplying nutrients and in providing ion exchange capacity in tropical soils. Organic matter decomposition rates in tropical soils are generally faster than in temperate soils because decay of the nonlabile fraction is generally faster.
   Changes in tropical land use have profound effects on SOM status. Tropical deforestation causes significant losses of soil carbon and nitrogen which tend to decline further under continuous cultivation. Reasons for declines in soil fertility include accelerated soil erosion, loss of litter influx after canopy removal and enhanced decomposition and nutrient mineralization rates after forest clearance. A wide range of soil management techniques have been designed to conserve and improve SOM stocks in tropical cultivation systems. These include agroforestry techniques, intercropping with legumes and the use of mulches and other organic inputs. While many of these techniques look promising in terms of improved crop yields, there is urgent need for research on how these practices alter the physical, chemical and biological processes and conditions of tropical soils.

AB Research techniques that have greatly advanced agronomic science in the 20th century, and have enhanced our knowledge of cause and effect, have been accompanied by reductionism. As a result, much valuable research has been accomplished, but less synthesis of results has occurred that provides answers to landscape-level research questions. We propose that a systems approach to the study of soil and crop management problems is a useful technique that tests our present research knowledge in a way that answers practical agricultural problems and simultaneously identifies gaps in basic research knowledge. We have used a problem common to the Great Plains to demonstrate the systems approach: minimizing the soil- and environment-degrading practice of summer fallowing and simultaneously increasing farm profitability. Although much is known about summer fallow at specific locations, less is known about extrapolating this knowledge across soil and climatic gradients. We show that intensified crop sequences under no-till techniques can replace summer fallow in many environments, and increase the productivity per unit of water received. Simultaneous reductions in the damaging factors of summer fallowing, in particular soil erosion and organic matter losses, also have occurred. We are researching the problem at a landscape level without losing the ability to detect causae and effect, and are able to simultaneously conduct basic research on soil nutrient cycling and water budgets. The approach also is being used effectively as an adult educational tool, thereby facilitating the transfer of technology from the researcher to the producer.

TI POTENTIAL EFFECT OF NO-TILL MANAGEMENT ON CARBON IN THE AGRICULTURAL

SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT

AB Agricultural soils act as both a source and a sink for atmospheric carbon. Since the onset of cultivation, the 211.5 million ha of agricultural soils in the former Soviet Union (FSU) have lost 10.2 Gt of carbon. No-till management represents a promising option to increase the amount of carbon sequestered in the agricultural soil of the FSU. No-till management reduces erosion and sequesters additional carbon in the soil by lowering the soil temperature and raising soil moisture.
   To determine the carbon sequestered under no-till management, a data base containing precultivation estimates of soil carbon for the seven major classes of soil found in the agricultural areas of the FSU was used to establish an equilibrium carbon content for each soil. Other published data provided a method to quantify the change in soil carbon brought about by converting to no-till management. Soils suitable for no-till management were analyzed and estimates of changes in carbon storage were made.
   No-till management is not suitable in areas where crop production is limited by cold, wet soils. Based on the results of a geographic information system analysis using maps of climatic factors and soil characteristics, 181 million ha in the FSU were identified as climatically suitable for no-till management almost 86% of all agricultural land). Complete conversion of all climatically suitable land to no-till management would sequester 3.3 Gt of carbon. This represents a 10% increase in carbon in the agricultural soils of the FSU. This estimated accumulation of carbon is associated with a new soil carbon equilibrium condition. Accumulation of carbon in the soil produced by a conversion from conventional to no-till management is expected to take at least 10 years. The carbon accumulation produced by conversion to no-till management is not a continuing process; once a new no-till equilibrium condition has been reached, additional quantities of atmospheric carbon will not be sequestered in agricultural soils through continued no-till management.

AB Few studies conducted in western Canada have assessed how crop rotations and fertilization influence soil organic matter content on land that has been cropped for many years. We monitored soil organic matter in the 0- to 0.15- and 0.15. to 0.3-m depths of a 24-yr crop rotation experiment conducted on a medium-textured Aridic Haploboroll in southwestern Saskatchewan. Prior to the study, the land had been in a hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow rotation for almost-equal-to 50 yr. Only the 0- to 0.15-m segment showed significant treatment effects. Due to good weather and crop yields in the first 15 yr, soil organic matter had increased under well-fertilized annually cropped rotations, and it remained constant under fallow-containing rotations and under continuous wheat receiving inadequate N fertilizer. Because of several dry years in the regnal 9 yr of the study, all rotations except a well-fertilized, fallow-winter cereal-wheat system lost organic matter. Changes in organic matter were directly related to the amount of crop residues produced by these systems and their ease of eroding. Soil organic matter was inversely related to apparent N deficit (i.e., N exported in grain minus N applied as fertilizer). The fallow-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)-wheat rotation receiving N and P fertilizer had the lowest soil organic matter, partly due to low production of crop residues by flax, partly to greater leaching of NO3, and partly due to some loss of flax residues blown from the plots. Soil organic matter in the well-fertilized fallow-winter cereal-wheat rotation remained constant because its shorter fallow period reduced soil erosion, and due to its more efficient use of N, as evidenced by minimal leached NO3-N.

AB The effects of soil tillage and crop rotation on humic substances of an oxisol from southern Brazil were studied. Soils were sampled from conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems applied to soybean-wheat (S-W) and soybean-lupine-maize-wheat (S-L-M-W) rotations. Two additional samples from soils with secondary forest and eucalyptus were collected.
   Humic substances (HS) were extracted by chelating ion exchange resin and water. Grey humic acids (GHA), brown humic acids (BHA) and fulvic acids (FA) were analysed chromatographically on controlled pore glass.
   As expected, cultivation and tillage led to a decrease in soil organic carbon content. This diminution was somewhat lower in conventional tillage with S-L-M-W, compared with S-W rotation.
   The total amount of extractable HS was higher for forest soils. Cultivated soils with both CT and NT showed higher contents of GHA than BHA and FA. Crop rotation had an important influence on the quality of the organic matter as the S-W rotation with both CT and NT showed the highest GHA contents.
   Soils with eucalyptus exhibited the highest amount of extractable humic substances among the investigated soils.

DT Article
AB Soils under intensive cultivation have altered due to water erosion. This study was conducted to determine whether soil organic matter (SOM) composition of the colluvial source (Ap horizons) differs from the colluvial sink (M horizons). The SOM of a sandy Catena with erodic Cambisols and colluvic soils (Colluvisols) in Schleswig-Holstein, Northwest Germany, was investigated. A wet chemical analysis was combined with CPMAS C-13-NMR spectroscopy. In one case a significant correlation between the SOM composition of the Ap horizon of the erodic Cambisol and the M horizon of the Colluvisol was high (r2 = 0.904***), whereas the con-elation for the other set was much weaker (r2 = 0.640*). Two possible paths of pedogenesis are discussed. About 70 % of the SOM of the colluvial source is decomposed during translocation or after deposition. A selective preservation or new formation of humins in the M material is probable. These humins contain, obviously, large amounts of polysaccharides, which were not detected by the wet chemical analysis. Further investigations of colluvic and erodic soils are necessary in order to specify the SOM quality and its possible modification due to soil translocation and accumulation.

AB The traditional land-use system in the agricultural belt of the Venezuelan High Andes (3,000-4,000 m) includes extended fallows (from 7 to more than 20 years) alternating with short cultivation periods (1-4 years). This management produces a mosaic landscape where potato or cereal fields coexist with recuperating fallows of various ages and with land remaining uncultivated because of limitations of slope or stoniness. This land-use strategy maintains a high natural diversity in a way that allows an acceptable productivity without the use of mineral fertilizers. The ecological base underlying the functioning of the agricultural system is analyzed, mainly in relation to the recuperation of nutrients during the fallow periods. The ecological sustainability is discussed in light of the negligible erosion rates and the maintenance of high levels of soil organic matter. The massive introduction of chemical fertilizers in recent years induced important changes that are exemplified by the case study of the land-use strategy of a farmer.

AB Identification and mapping of areas affected by various soil degradation processes in medium textured alluvial plain of arid region of India was performed. Impact of degradation on physicochemical properties of soils was evaluated. Soil degradation processes were identified by using Landsat TM FCC subscene and ground truth verification. The kind, extent, and severity of degradations were mapped. Soil stripping, sheet wash, gully erosion, and natural or man-induced salinization were the major soil degradation processes. In an area of over 3563 km2, 52% of the area was degraded due to soil stripping, sheet wash, and gully erosion, and 8% due to salinity. Degradation due to combined water erosion and salinization covered 33% of the total area. Nearly 30% of the area needs urgent attention to arrest the process of soil degradation. Soil degradation processes have resulted in the loss of organic carbon, available phosphorus, and available potassium.

AB Tillage systems that address soil conservation and sustainable crop yield need to be developed. Research was conducted on a Walla Walla silt loam (Typic Haploxeroll) to determine the long-term (19 years) effect of four tillage systems on soil properties and crop yield in a green pea (Pisum sativum L.)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation that was started in 1968. The experimental design was a split plot with four replications. Wheat and peas were grown each season. The primary tillage systems were: (T1) fall moldboard plow after wheat and after peas (control); (T2) fall rototill after wheat and fall sweep after peas; (T3) spring moldboard plow after wheat and fall moldboard plow after peas; (T4) no tillage after wheat and fall sweep after peas. Soil measurements included bulk density, pH, organic carbon, penetration resistance, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Profiles of bulk density, penetration resistance and pH revealed unique differences among treatments. However, there were no consistent differences in yield among the four tillage systems, in either green peas or wheat. From a crop production viewpoint, changes in soil properties on these tillage plots were inconsequential. From a soil erosion viewpoint, spring plowing (T3) and conservation tillage (T4) have an advantage over T2 and T1 because surface cover is maintained during the first winter following wheat harvest. Results show the importance of testing tillage systems over long periods of time and that the traditional system of fall moldboard plowing after wheat and after peas can be replaced by conservation systems without yield loss.

AB A deposit of post-glacial organo-calcareous silt 25-40 m thick blankets the floor of Suva Harbour and its marginal inlets, including Draunibota Bay, on the southeast coast of Viti Levu, Fiji. This deposit is notable for its involvement in a large number of foundation failures in the area. The organo-calcareous silt is the latest sedimentary infill over a late Pleistocene erosional surface which is dissected characteristically down to around 50 m below current mean sea level at the harbour margins, and to at least 90 m at the seaward end of the study area. The gross distribution of Pleistocene and Holocene sedimentary units is strongly influenced by Pliocene graben formation in the Mio-Pliocene bedrock. The silt deposit forms part of a transgressive and highstand systems tract related to the latest glacio-eustatic sea-level rise, and includes a series of lobate delta deposits currently prograding at the mouths of streams entering the harbour. The silt was deposited in a lagoonal/estuarine environment of restricted circulation in a marginal/back-barrier reef situation and received a variety of marine carbonate and terrigenous sediment contributions, as well as organic substances from both autochthonous and allochthonous sources. Undisturbed sampling indicates the silt to be homogeneous, non-layered and thoroughly bioturbated, but a distinct layering with a spacing in the order of 1-5 m, probably related to periodic influxes of terrigenous material, is obvious on continuous seismic profiles. Acoustic turbidity due to biogenic gas in thick accumulations over palaeo-channels may well represent zones of high pore fluid pressure, and indicate lower effective soil strength. There is also evidence that the passage of the overpressured gas front results in hydraulic fracturing and consequent degassing of the silt. The silt deposit displays a slight upward coarsening in response to shoaling conditions, accompanied by an upward increase in both organic carbon and calcium carbonate proportions, and a decreasing terrigenous contribution. The increase in organic carbon is closely mirrored by increased diagenetic development of bacterially-deposited agglomerates of iron sulfide crystals in the pore spaces. The resulting pore-space microstructure appears to exert a direct control on the in-situ void ratio, and hence directly affects the consolidation and strength characteristics of the sediment. Radiocarbon dates from the silt deposit indicate a consistent rate of deposition in the Draunibota palaeo-channel of 4.3 m/1000 yr since the marine transgressive front passed the site some 9600 yr B.P. The dates extend the reliable local sea-level data for southeast Viti Levu back some further 4000 years, and support an earlier contention that sea level reached its current position here at around 4000-4500 yr B.P., about 2000 years later than on the coast of southeast Australia. Water depth at the Cement Works Bridge site reached a maximum of 20 m some 5000 yr B.P. and, subsequently, has gradually shoaled to its present position just below mean sea level.

AB To analyze the changes induced by cultivation such as soil erosion and soil organic matter depletion, we examined Andisols in Japan, by comparing the morphological characteristics and organic matter contents of seven cultivated soils (cultivation for 270 y) with those of four uncultivated soils (vegetation consisting of deciduous broad-leaved trees) on the Musashino plateau. The 2Bw or 3Bw horizons corresponding to the upper part of the Tachikawa loam layer No. 2 (Tc. 2) with red and black scoriae in close contact, were observed at 90-97 cm and 45-72 cm depths from the soil surf ace, respectively in the uncultivated and cultivated sites. The differences in the soil thickness from the surface to the top of Tc. 2 between the uncultivated and cultivated soils suggested that the soils were eroded as a result of cultivation for crop production. The A horizon thickness was 52-80 cm in the uncultivated soils, and 22-52 cm in the cultivated soils. As a result of the decrease of the A horizon thickness due to cultivation, the area based contents of organic matter in the most of the cultivated soils were markedly lower than those of the uncultivated soils. However, in one cultivated soil, the area based contents of organic matter did not decrease, and the changes in the area based content of organic matter induced by cultivation exhibited a wide range among cultivated soils. There were no statistical differences in soil color, bulk density, and concentrations of organic carbon and total nitrogen between the uncultivated A2 and cultivated Ap horizons.

AB Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron oxyhydroxide profiles were used to explain the retention of Hg in sediments of natural lakes and flooded soils in Quebec. In lake sediments, Hg levels increased from background concentrations of approximately 100 ng/g beneath the 10- to 16-cm depth interval to 150-490 ng/g near the surface. This increase was attributed to atmospheric inputs to the environment. In forest soils, the close association of Hg with the surficial organic horizon appears to be a potential source of contamination for the aquatic system through the transport of particulate matter by surface runoff. High organic matter content observed in the flooded soil of LG-2 Reservoir suggests that postsedimentation biodegradation is a slow process. In contrast, at Cabonga Reservoir, an 80% reduction in C, N, and Hg concentrations was observed between the flooded and the adjacent forest soil. Mechanical erosion processes (marling, waves, ice) rather than biodegradation seem responsible for the observed loss in C, N, and Hg. We propose that suspension of the humic horizon from flooded soils could constitute a significant source of Hg contamination to the overlying waters and biota until the exposed littoral zone stabilizes.

AB The C stored in soils is nearly three times that in the aboveground biomass and approximately double that in the atmosphere. Reliable estimates have been difficult to obtain due to a lack of global data on kinds of soils and the amount of C in each soil. With new data bases, our study is able to provide more reliable data than previous estimates. Globally, 1576 Pg of C is stored in soils, with almost-equal-to 506 Pg (32%) of this in soils of the tropics. It is also estimated that almost-equal-to 40% of the C in soils of the tropics is in forest soils. Other studies have shown that deforestation can result in 20 to 50% loss of this stored C, largely through erosion.

AB Conservation tillage on vertisols has not been well accepted, yet residue management techniques are needed to control water erosion on these highly-erodible soils. Surface soil properties were determined on a Houston black clay (Udic Pellusterts) one crop season after chisel plow-disk tillage, and after 6 and 10 years in a continuous controlled-traffic, no-till management system. Bulk density and penetrometer resistance below 50 mm increased with increasing time since primary tillage. Soil penetrometer resistance values were not in the root restricting range at the soil water contents at time of sampling. Stratification of soil nutrients, total nitrogen and phosphorus, and soil organic carbon increased with time since primary tillage. Conservation tillage appears to be sustainable on these vertisols for an extended period of time with the controlled-traffic, no-till practices used in this study.

AB Abundance and distribution of earthworms were studied on the Georgia Piedmont of the Southeastern U.S.A., at sites representing various ecosystem types, management practices, landscape positions, soil textures and soil erosion status. Earthworm abundance showed distinct seasonal patterns, with winter/spring maxima and summer minima. Numbers and biomass ranged from zero in plowed, mono-cropped soil at an upland site to over 1000 m-2 (>25g ash-free dry wt m-2) in no-tillage, double-cropped soil on bottomlands. Numbers and biomass in plowed, double-cropped soil, in a bottomland forest, and in grass meadows at both upland and bottomland sites were intermediate. Soil texture, as influenced by water erosion, strongly affected earthworm abundance. Moderately and severely eroded sandy clay loam supported significantly higher earthworm numbers and biomass than did slightly eroded soil with higher sand content. This effect may have resulted from low organic content and water holding capacity of the sandy soils. Of the soil texture variables, silt content was most highly correlated with earthworm biomass. Earthworm abundance was also related to quantity and quality of plant residue inputs in the agroecosystems, and to standing stocks of soil organic carbon across all sites studied. At most agroecosystem and forest sites, the predominant earthworm species were European lumbricids; native Diplocardia spp were most prominent in a meadow soil with high organic content.

AB Cs-137 redistribution data have been used to estimate the extent and the pattern of long-term soil erosion in the Quebec City area. Mean annual net soil movements ranging from a deposition of 10.8 t ha-1 yr-1 to a loss of 31.8 t ha-1 yr-1 were estimated. The slope steepness and the land use significantly influenced the estimated rates of soil movement, while soil texture was less important, probably because of the soils' sandy texture or the high content of organic carbon, which kept their erodibility low. The net soil losses estimated from Cs-137 data were consistently higher than those predicted by the USLE. Besides net soil losses, it was possible to estimate separately the magnitude of soil detachment and soil deposition. Two-thirds of the stations sampled experienced net soil loss while the remaining third showed evidence of soil accumulation. These data suggest that the small net soil losses measured for low erosive conditions (flat slopes, dairy farming) result from important soil redeposition rates as much as from small soil detachment rates. Cs-137 redistribution data not only produce reliable estimates of soil movement rates, but also allow enhanced estimates of the agronomic and environmental impacts of soil erosion.

AB Lateral migration of Amazonian lowland rivers causes a vegetation succession on recently deposited fluvial sediments. The forest ground is formed gradually in sequence, giving rise to age-zonation of the successional stages. Using Landsat MSS maps and field observations, we studied variations in fluvial landform evolution and river character. The widely used characterizations of the rivers according to their suspension-load character and channel pattern were evaluated in relation to the vegetation succession. Sequential successional forests appear extensively along meandering white-water rivers, which are rich in suspended sediments and are characterized by mobile channels. Conversely, vegetation zonation is less pronounced at the margins of slowly eroding suspension-poor rivers. Line transects were established to document meander development along eight different rivers. The chemical composition of the recently deposited alluvium differs markedly both among rivers and along the transects. Concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen increase toward the meander neck along with the acid reaction of the soil. The rate of riverine forest regeneration in Peruvian lowland Amazonia was extrapolated on the basis of erosion data from four different rivers. and suggests that approximately 130 km2 of forest is annually eroded and replaced by successional vegetation, the equivalent of 0.2% of the present floodplain area of this region.

AB The      pentacyclic       triterpene 17beta(H),21beta(H)-hop-22(29)-ene (diploptene) occurs in sediments throughout the Columbia River drainage basin and off the southern coast of Washington state in concentrations comparable to long-chain plantwax n-alkanes. The same relationship is evident for diploptene and long-chain n-alkanes in soils from the Willamette Valley. Microorganisms indigenous to soils and soil erosion are indicated as the biological source and physical process, respectively, for diploptene in coastal sediments. Similarity between the stable carbon isotopic composition (deltaC-13(PDB)) of diploptene isolated from soil in the Willamette Valley (-31.2+/-0.3 parts per thousand) and from sediments deposited throughout the Washington coastal environment (-31.2+/-0.5 parts per thousand) supports this argument. Values of delta for diploptene in river sediments are variable and 8-179 parts per thousand lighter, indicating that an additional biological source such as methane-oxidizing bacteria makes a significant contribution to the diploptene record in river sediments. Selective biodegradation resulting from a difference in the physicochemical association within eroded particles can explain the absence of the more-C-13-depleted form of diploptene in Washington coastal sediments, but this mechanism remains unproven.

AB A study was conducted to compare soil properties of slight, moderate, and severe erosion phases and to determine the effect of past erosion on corn grain yield. The study was located on Marlette fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic, Glossoboric Hapludalf) near East Lansing, Michigan. Solum thickness decreased from 135 cm to 56 cm (53 to 22 inches) with increasing degrees of erosion. Clay content, bulk density, soil pH, and cation exchange capacity of the Ap horizon increased, while organic carbon decreased with increasing erosion. Corn yield averages for severely eroded plots were 2196 less than those from the slightly eroded plots, averaged over the 5-year period. Yield reductions ranged from 6% in 1989 to 4896 in 1988 when May and June were droughty. Corn maturity was slightly delayed by increased erosion, Stand counts of severely eroded plots were significantly less than those of the slightly eroded plots. Yield reductions probably resulted from a soil moisture shortage. The severely eroded soils were classified into a different subgroup than the slight and moderately eroded soils.

TI ESTIMATING THE WATER-DISPERSIBLE CLAY CONTENT OF SOILS
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

ID RED-BROWN EARTH; ELECTROLYTE CONCENTRATION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES;
   FLOCCULATION; HORIZON
AB Soil erodibility is influenced by several soil properties including the extent to which the clay fraction will disperse in water. Because early methods for estimating soil erosion were empirical methods and did not utilize water-dispersible clay as a parameter, few data have been collected. The recent development of the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process-based model for predicting water erosion that uses water-dispersible clay in the algorithm for computing interrill erodibility, resulted in an increased demand for these data. In order to accommodate this and similar models, a method for estimating the water-dispersible clay content of soils based on existing information is needed. Data collected by the National Soil Survey Laboratory in support of the WEPP were used to identify soil properties that were significantly correlated with water-dispersible clay and to develop equations to estimate the water-dispersible clay content of soils based on those properties. The property most strongly correlated with water-dispersible day is total clay. Other properties significantly correlated with water-dispersible clay are the water content at 1.5 MPa, dithionite-citrate-extractable Fe and Al, the  coefficient of linear extensibility, Wischmeier's M, the very-fine-sand content, the ratio of cation-exchange capacity (CEC) to total day, Bouyoucos' clay ratio, and the CEC. A simple linear regression of water-dispersible clay vs. total clay revealed that, for the soils included in this study, approximately one-third of the total clay was water dispersible. However, the model only bad an R2 of 0.604. When the ratio of the CEC corrected for organic carbon (CCEC) to total clay was included in the model, the R2 improved to 0.723. However, sorting the data by the ratio of CCEC to total clay instead of including it in the model improved the overall fit of the model and increased the R2 to 0.879.

LA English

ID LONG-TERM TRENDS; SOIL PROPERTIES; SOUTHERN QUEENSLAND; FERTILITY
AB Changes in soil physico-chemical properties as a result of continuous cereal cropping for up to 64 years of two southern Queensland Vertisols were investigated. The soils were the Waco black earth and the Langlands grey clay. For both soils, cultivation increased bulk densities relative to those of respective virgin soils, but soil density varied little among cultivated sites. The size and strength of dry seedbed aggregates decreased owing to cultivation, but remained suitable for wheat establishment. The stability of wet aggregates decreased with cultivation as indicated by dispersion and slaking measurements. The increased dispersion was associated with decreases in hydraulic conductivity which may limit infiltration and storage of soil water during the summer fallow, thereby reducing crop yields.
   Organic carbon contents decreased with cultivation while exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and pH values increased. Increased dispersibility was correlated with increased sodicity, although ESP values remained below accepted critical values. The relationship was strongest when both dispersibility and exchangeable sodium were expressed on an oven-dry soil basis rather than as the relative parameters, dispersion ratio and ESP. Organic carbon content accounted for less than 40% of the temporal variation in aggregate stability.
   The changes in physical and chemical properties with cultivation were consistent with exposure of subsurface material following soil erosion at rates typical for the region. We concluded that erosion control would limit further changes in levels of exchangeable sodium and thus soil dispersibility and hydraulic conductivities. The rate of loss of organic carbon would also be reduced and soil physical properties and chemical fertility would be maintained.

AB Sediment redistribution within near-level agricultural fields in the Gray Wooded soil zone of Saskatchewan was studied using the artificial environmental tracer caesium-137 (Cs-137).  The objective of this study was to estimate erosion rates caused by wind erosion, and land clearing techniques (i.e. bulldozing).  Net rates of erosion and deposition were quantified over the past 30 years on three fields.  Wind erosion was estimated to be approximately 1.0 t ha-1 y-1 on a near-level field, with 50 per cent of the sampling sites having erosion rates in excess of soil formation.  Bulldozing produced median net sediment flux values of between 40 and 90 t ha-1 y-1.  In addition, between 65 and 85 per cent of the sampling sites had erosion rates in excess of the maximum tolerable limit (i.e. 11.0 t ha-1 y-1).  These results indicate significant accelerated erosion results from land clearing techniques used in central Saskatchewan.  Bulldozing of the fields removed the LFH-horizon and exposed the underlying mineral horizon.  Bulk densitites of the 0 to 15 cm layer in the cleared fields were 27 to 55 per cent greater than the comparable depth increment within the undisturbed forest site.  Organic carbon concentrations within the 1930s, 1979, and 1987 fields were decreased by 47, 42, and 37 per cent, respectively following cultivation and bulldozing.  Decreases in total nitrogen for the cultivated fields ranged from 33 to 38 per cent.

TI RESTORATION OF ERODED SOIL WITH CONSERVATION TILLAGE
SO SOIL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Eroded Kandhapludult soils occupy more than 40% of the Southern Piedmont region of the USA. The humid-thermic climate associated with the Ultisols permits double crop residue production ranging from 10 to 14 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Long-term conservation tillage into these crop residues is beneficial in ameliorating the effects of soil erosion. During the course of a five-year study, decomposition of these residues increased soil carbon significantly. Restoration processes were initiated by increasing average soil carbon, representing slight, moderate and severe soil erosion classes, from 0.97 to 2.37% in the 0 to 1.5-cm depth. Accompanying soil carbon responses were increases in soil N, water-stable aggregation and infiltration. Runoff coefficients on conservation tilled restored soils was only 6%, compared to 35% for those conventionally tilled. Rill and interrill soil loss rates were also reduced significantly with surface residue provided with conservation tillage.
   Restoring Ultisol landscapes with variable levels of soil erosion requires differential fertilization. All fertilizer requirements for severely eroded plots were 1.43 to 2.30-fold higher than those of moderately eroded plots. Because biological N fixation by the crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) cover crop appeared to be retarded on the severely eroded site, observed plant N stress developed on the irrigated/conservation tillage treatment. Cumulative grain yields of severely eroded site, ranged from 15.4 to 30.3 Mg ha-1 5 yr-1 and were statistically equal to or exceeded those of the slightly eroded site. Conservation tillage grain yields were best optimized on the rainfed-moderately eroded site, probably because of the more desirable texture-organic properties of the 13-cm thick Ap horizon. Management of cool-season cover crops with conservation tillage appears essential to restore and sustain crop productivity on eroded Ultisols.

AB It is now well accepted that riparian forests have an important role in regulating upstream/downstream flow of matter and energy in river ecosystems. Since geomorphic processes determine the structure of channels and floodplains, we have investigated whether different geomorphic features of riparian forests had any effects on the ability of their soils to retain nutrients and organic carbon. Willow riparian forests were chosen within the annual floodplain of the Garonne River, southwest France, to represent two different geomorphic types. Erosional types of riparian forests (E-type) were characterized by sand deposition on their soils because of high current velocity which hampered fine particle deposition. Depositional types of riparian forests (D-type) were characterized by slower overflow velocity; consequently silt and clay were dominant in their soils. Soil samples were taken at the end of the vegetation growth period, coinciding with low water levels prior to annual floods. Erosion and sedimentation processes affected the distribution of total C,N, and P contents in riparian forest soils, since they were significantly correlated with soil grain size. D-type riparian forest soils act as a sink for upstream/downstream nutrients and carbon flows during floods through accumulation of total C,N and P from year to year. In contrast, E-type riparian forests act as potential nutrient sources during high water periods, since they may release from their soils large amounts of easily available C, N and P into the river. These results demonstrate that nutrients and carbon retention ability of riparian forest soils should be analyzed through their geomorphic features rather than by their vegetation composition. Even if they belong to the same vegetation succession, riparian forests should not be considered as a homogeneous buffering system for upstream/downstream flows of nutrients and organic carbon.

AB The Holocene record of Lake Lugano (southern basin: surface area 20.3 km2, maximum depth 87 m) comprising organic carbon-rich sediments (sapropels), is divided into eight intervals based on radiocarbon- and varve-dating. The content of organic carbon, inorganic carbon, and biogenic silica, as well as the benthic remains of ostracods and oligochaetes, are converted into accumulation rates and benthic abundances in order to assess past production rates and bottom water oxygen status, respectively. The results suggest three periods of distinct palaeolimnological character: (i) low primary production combined with shifts between aerobic and anaerobic profundal conditions (prior to ca. 3000 BC), (ii) moderate rates of production combined with a relatively high profundal oxygen content (after ca. 1500 BC), and (iii), high production rates (460 g C m-2 a-1) combined with anaerobic profundal conditions (present eutrophic state). Corresponding organic carbon contents in the sediments are: up to 5 % (i), 4 % (ii), and 8 % (iii). Until the beginning of this century, the flux of autochthonous sediments to the lake floor correlated with the fluctuations in the allochthonous sediment accumulation rate, indicating that catchment erosion largely controlled lacustrine production during the Holocene history of Lake Lugano. Pollen data show catchment-vegetational transformations at ca. 3500 BC (change from fir to beech forests), al 1400 BC (onset of cereal vegetation) and at ca. A.D. 450 (strong increase in various cultural plants). The first two changes had a relatively large imprint on lacustrine sedimentation. At ca. 3500 BP, erosion increase in the catchment was triggered by vegetation changes in the mountain zone above ca. 1000 m a.s.l., which may have been induced by climatic and human alteration (drop in the treeline altitude). Maximum catchment erosion occurred at ca. 1400 BC which was clearly dominated by human cultivation during the Bronze Age. More oxygenated profundal conditions in the lake after ca. 3000 BC are possibly related to a better mixing of the lake waters during the winter season by increased wind activity.

AB The effect of experimental fire regimes on soil nutrient pool values, surface condition status and herbage growth was studied in a shrub-invaded woodland on massive red earths near Coolabah, New South Wales. Artificial fuel was burnt in spring on plots to achieve intervals of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 years between fires.
   No differences between fire regimes were detected below 1 cm for any of the measured soil variables. Soil respiration declined linearly with increasing number of fires and increasing total fuel load. There were no differences or trend for available or total soil nitrogen, organic carbon or soil wettability in the 0-1 cm horizon, but relatively refractory elements such as P and K, derived from the ash from the artificial fuel, built up in the soil proportionately with increased fire number and total fuel load.
   The surface condition status of the soil as assessed by a monitoring method was strongly inversely related to the number of fires and total fuel load. Differences in herbage growth between fire treatments were not significant; however, where plots had been burnt five times, herbage growth was greater with increased variability (35.8 g m-2, s.e. 19.0) compared with unburnt controls (10.7 g m-2, s.e. 1.7). Plots burnt seven times annually  had similar means and variance to controls. Low herbage yields in control plots were attributed to the high biomass of mature shrubs, whilst increasing variability with number of fires was caused by the combination of patchy decreased shrub biomass and small-scale erosion-deposition cells which differentially distribute seeds across the soil surface. Plots burnt annually seven times had deposition beyond the plot area.

AB A long-term tillage trial was conducted (1981 to 1987) on loamy textured soils to quantify changes in runoff, soil loss and some soil physical properties due to conservation tillage practices. Two sites were established, one at Cowra on a sandy loam textured soil, and the other at Grenfell on a loamy textured soil. The tillage treatments imposed were direct drilling (DD), reduced tillage (RT) and traditional tillage (TT), with grazing at both sites, and a direct drilling ungrazed (NT) treatment at Cowra only. Runoff and soil loss were measured using a rainfall simulator, and sorptivity (S), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(sat)), bulk density to 40 mm (BD4) and 100 mm (BD10), organic carbon (OC) and water stable aggregates (WSA) were measured annually.
   Runoff decreased significantly in the minimum soil disturbance treatments (NT and DD) at Cowra. Runoff did not decrease in the stubble incorporation treatments despite a significant increase in OC and WSA. Decreases in runoff were due to the development and maintenance of porosity, particularly macropores.
   Changes in other soil physical properties were generally not significant owing to temporal variability. The regression relationship between OC and WSA, although significant, had little practical value because of high prediction error.
   Although improvements in soil physical properties were measured, a period of at least five years of cropping at both sites was required before they became significant and consistent.

AB Fossil soils, especially the red soils, (linked with interstadial conditions) in the terraces of Mediterranean rivers can be important chronoclimatostratigraphic markers.  The lack of organic remains makes them generally unsuitable for palaeobiological studies, and thus palaeomorphological dating has been the main method applied to determine their relative age.  We present the first results of TL dating of fossil soils and water-lain sediments from the catchment area of the Turia, Jucar and Serpis Rivers in the region of Valencia (Spain).  The regeneration method was used to determine the palaeodoses in fine silt grains extracted from the bulk samples and Nal(Tl) gamma-spectrometry was used for determination of the dose-rates.
   A blind test on a radiocarbon dated 20 ka old sample from the Po Plain (Italy) and TL ages for the Eemian palaeolithic site in Cova Negra (Valencia, Spain) indicate that the method can give correct results within the whole of the Last Glacial/Interglacial period.  The specific sedimentation regime interspersed with strong erosional processes in Mediterranean valleys (coarse-grain and stony sediments, frequent erosional contacts) are not very favourable for TL dating or interpretation of the results.  Also post-sedimentation changes (e.g. carbonate leaching and accumulation inside the dated horizon) could affect the dose-rate and consequently the TL age.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative methods of estimating the postsettlement soil erosion from hillslopes in a small watershed in Bureau County, northwestern Illinois. Methods used include: (i) estimation of the soil erosion using total organic C balance or enrichment ratio, (ii) selected soil property comparisons between the cultivated, sloping, and eroded soils of the watershed and uncultivated, sloping, and uneroded reference soils of the same taxa occurring in the area cemeteries, and (iii) Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). Previously measured sediment remaining in the sediment basin and calculated sediment delivery were used as the bases for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed methods to estimate soil erosion from the surrounding hillslopes. Differences in thickness of the A horizon consistently underestimated soil erosion by 64% relative to the estimates made by the total sediment remaining in basin and delivered to the stream. This suggests erosion classes which are based on erosion of topsoil underestimate the extent of erosion from both the topsoil and subsoil, particularly where soils have been severely truncated. Organic C redistribution was highly correlated to sediment delivery method and appear to be related directly to the quantity of soil eroded and could provide an alternative to A horizon thickness differences as a basis for quantifying soil erosion. The soil erosion estimated by the USLE was 80% of the soil erosion estimated by the sediment delivery method. This difference can be accounted for by the fact that the sediment delivery method assumed all the sediment came from the sideslopes and USLE is not designed to include erosion resulting from concentrated overland flow (gully erosion). The comparison between cultivated and uncultivated sites of the depth to carbonates and the lowest part of the Bt horizon containing 27% clay between eroded and uneroded phases of Tama soils each produced an estimate of soil erosion within 17% of the soil erosion estimated hy sediment delivery method and could be used to estimate soil erosion.

TI CESIUM-137 DISTRIBUTION IN A CALIFORNIA PELLOXERERT - EVIDENCE OF
   PEDOTURBATION
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

AB The distribution of Cs-137 activity in soils provides a means of assessing physical transport of soil particles.  We measured the activity of Cs-137 along cracks and within peds of a Chromic Pelloxerert on the flood plain of an ephemeral stream in the Central Valley of California to assess the role of pedoturbation in the formation of a Vertisol.  The Cs-137 activity is highest in the upper 10 cm of the soil and generally decreases with increasing depth, although Cs-137 activity is also high locally along cracks and at the bottom of some cracks near the average depth of cracking (base of Bss horizon, 72-cm depth).  Laterally (along cracks vs. ped interiors), the Cs-137 activity varies greatly and shows no consistent pattern.  Micromorphological evidence of stress-oriented clay in soil fabric and locally high Cs-137 activity below 72 cm indicate incorporation of surface materials into deeper cracks during drierthan-average years.  Organic carbon (OC) content decreases regularly with depth, whereas CaCO3 content is uniform throughout the upper 72 cm.  The nonhomogeneous Cs-137 distribution demonstrates that pedoturbation has occurred.  The rate of homogenization of soil material in the upper 72 cm exceeds 25 yr and is slower than the rate of OC accumulation and humification, but faster than the rate of carbonate redistribution.  We attribute relatively high Cs-137 activity throughout the upper 20 to 30 cm of the soil to incorporation of surface material into minor cracks that open during the dry season.  The incorporation of sloughed materials at the base of larger cracks, where evidence of shearing (slickensides) is most strongly developed, is only locally significant and is probably not the dominant mechanism of pedoturbation.

TI ORGANIC-CARBON EFFECTS ON AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY OF 3 SOIL TEXTURAL
   GROUPS
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB A major cause of soil productivity loss through erosion is attributed to changes in soil water-holding properties or a reduction in thickness of the plant rooting zone.  The objective of this study was to measure the effect of management-induced changes in soil organic carbon (OC) concentration on soil characteristics affecting the available water capacity.  Four sites each of moderately coarse (sandy), medium, and moderately fine or fine (fine) soils were sampled in four increments to 0.457 m within each of two cropland management systems (conventionally cultivated and stubble mulched) and each of two virgin grassland management systems (grazed virgin and relict virgin).  Measurements of the water concentration by weight (P(w)) at field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) were made on disturbed soil samples.  Bulk density decreased with increasing OC concentration.  The magnitude of change was greatest in sandy and least in the medium-textured soils.  For all soils combined, a change in sand fraction accounted for about 75% of the change in P(w) at both the FC and the PWP.  The change in P(w) was greater at FC than the PWP.  A unit change in OC concentration in the sandy soils caused a greater change in P(w) at FC than at the PWP, but in the medium and fine soils the change in P(w) at FC essentially paralleled the change at the PWP.  An increase in OC concentration did not change the available water capacity in the sandy group and decreased it in the medium and fine textural groups.  Loss of soil productivity induced by erosion in the northern Great Plains is probably more closely associated with a decline in nutrients and biological activity than from a change in available water capacity.

AB The Middle to Late Eocene Chumstick Formation comprises > 12 km of fluvial and lacustrine strata deposited in a strike-slip basin in Washington State. The Chumstick paleoflora is a mixed suite of broad-leaved evergreen and broad-leaved deciduous taxa, with physiognomic characteristics intermediate between paratropical and subtropical rainforest types. The Chumstick paleoflora probably occupied an intermediate paleogeographic position between lowland and montane rainforest, in a setting about 150 km inland from the Pacific coast at elevations up to about 750 m.
   Most plant macrofossils are found in proximal overbank sequences or on the preserved tops of emergent mid-channel bars. Certain taxa are more typical of floodplain versus channel-margin sites. Key differences were also noted between "upland" (proximal to fault scarps) and "lowland" taxa, which may be related to soil drainage. Chumstick paleosols include entisols (poor horizonal development), inceptisols (incipient Cca or K horizon development) and histosols (histic epipedons containing up to 6% total organic carbon).
   Paleovegetation had a significant effect on fluvial deposition in the Chumstick Formation. Even in coarse-grained, fault-proximal facies there is evidence for bank cohesion and stability, bank undercutting and failure, soil erosion, and overbank deposits. The dominance of vertical accretion over lateral channel migration in more distal deposits can be attributed to rapid subsidence, coupled with bank stability imparted by vegetation.

AB Arenites contain several types of non-carbonate intrabasinal (NCI) grains which are seldom given specific attention in petrographic studies.  However, recognition and analysis of these particles may be of invaluable help for stratigraphic, paleogeographic and even metamorphic reconstructions.
   Rip-up clasts are the most common NCI grains in various depositional environments.  Concentration of other NCI types, such as green peloids, ferruginous ooids, reworked phosphates, chert, soil fragments, black pebbles or pyrite clasts, occurs at times of reduced sedimentation rates.  During major transgressions, a wealth of iron, phosphorus, silica and organic matter of both terrestrial and marine origin is provided by rapid flooding of coastal plains, erosion of tropical soils developed during previous lowstand stages, and plankton blooms in nutrient-rich waters.  Prolonged periods of starved detrital supply foster authigenesis and formation of sediments rich in iron, phosphorus and silica in shallow encroaching seas.  Eventually, a variety of NCI grains from terrestrial, paralic and marine sources are reworked during stepwise coastal retreat and left as lags on ravinement surfaces or deposited in accreting sandwaves by storm or tidal currents.  On passive margins, NCI-rich arenite intervals are typically found in the basal transgressive tract of depositional supersequences, when a rapid short-term eustatic rise is superimposed on regional thermo-tectonic subsidence associated with waning rift volcanism, break-up and reorganization of plate motion.  Ironstone deposition is also favored by global "polytaxic" conditions and expanded oxygen-minimum layer in the oceans.  Various types of NCI grains are also found in active margins and foreland basins, where they are generally diluted due to higher sedimentation rates.
   Other NCI grains, including plant debris, siliceous tests, clastic gypsum and even rarer particles may occur as framework components in arenites.

TI ESTIMATION OF SOIL PROPERTIES AND WHEAT YIELDS ON COMPLEX ERODED HILLS
   USING GEOSTATISTICS AND THEMATIC MAPPER IMAGES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY; REGION
AB Better assessment of large scale patterns in soil fertility, erosion, and crop productivity is needed to address environmental concerns in the steeply rolling dryland farming region of eastern Washington.  Spatial variability of organic carbon, soil phosphorus, and wheat yields measured on several 655 m long transects in complex eroded hills of the Palouse region of eastern Washington was studied using classical statistics and geostatistics.  In addition, Landsat Thematic Mapper images of bare soil at the study site were used to estimate organic matter content in blocks having an area of 28.5 m x 28.5 m.  Classical statistical analysis showed moderate coefficients of variation in soil properties (25-50%) and wheat yields (30%).  Spherical semivariograms of soil properties and wheat yields showed strong spatial dependence, with a range of influence on the order of from 70 m to 145 m.  The semivariogram for Landsat estimated organic matter was almost identical to that for organic matter measured in the surface transects.  The cross-semivariogram between measured organic matter and wheat yields also exhibited strong spatial dependence, with a range of influence of about 120 m.  Organic matter, soil phosphorus, and wheat yield were interpolated at unsampled locations using block kriging and block cokriging techniques.  Excellent agreement was obtained between kriged wheat yields and wheat yields cokriged from Thematic Mapper estimates of organic matter.  Satisfactory agreement was obtained between kriged soil phosphorus and cokriged soil phosphorus based upon remotely sensed organic matter.  Results of this study provided strong evidence for nonrandom spatial patterns in soil properties and crop yields.  These spatial patterns are associated with changes in surface organic matter content across the landscape resulting from extensive erosion and exposure of subsoil.  Geostatistical techniques provide a powerful tool for interpolating ground measurements of soil properties and crop yield over large areas in combination with estimates of organic matter obtained from Thematic Mapper images.

Gamma emitting radionuclides of natural sources, K-40, Bi-214 (U-238 daughter), and Tl-208 (Th-232 daughter0, are distributed as a function of texture over the 15 cm depth.  Increasing clay content results in increased retention of these isotopes.  The K-40 distribution is a result of the amount of organic carbon present.  Increased organic carbon results in increased weathering and lower K-40 values.  Differing earthworm activity results in distinct distributions of Cs-137, a gamma emitting radionuclide from bomb fallout, within the four soils.  Larger numbers and biomass of anecic earthworms in finer textured soils result in a linear distribution of Cs-137 with depth.  Endogeous species in the coarsest textured soil result in little incorporation of Cs-137 with depth.

AB Three Aridisols, one Mollisol and one Entisol of a topographic sequence (catena) on calcareous materials of alluvial/colluvial fans on the piedmont slope of Sierra de Enmedia in the semiarid northeast of Mexico were examined.  Detailed profile descriptions and laboratory studies included particle size distribution, pH, specific conductance, soil carbonate fractions, organic C, total N, and plant-available and water-soluble nutrients.  During the youngest phase of morphodynamic stability, in which erosion processes were diminished, soils were formed from more or less eroded remnants of the fan sediments into extremely calcareous, very shallow to deep, brown, and poorly weathered soils with a loamy to extremely gravelly texture.  The availability of nutrients was moderate for N, Cu, to very low for P, Fe, Zn.  Only K and Mn showed adequate values.  The sodium saturation of subsoils was also very low ion spite of the proximity of saline soils.  Because of the unfavorable physical and chemical characteristics, the potential soil fertility is poor.  Therefore, any use of these soils would only be possible by extensive grazing management or cultivation of technical-use crops like Agave spp., Aloe vera L., Dasylirion longissimum Lem., Larrea tridentata (DC) Cov., Opuntia spp., Simmondsia chinensis Link, and Yucca spp. adapted to dry conditions.  Irrigated agriculture could also be carried out successfully on loamy riparian soils with low pebble content in the basin of sporadic water-bearing wadis or arroyos.

ID SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN-MOUNTAINS
AB This study was initiated to determine the basic characteristics and genesis of soils on gentle to very steep slopes on two contrasting slope aspects.  Two transects, a southwest (SW) and a northwest (NW) transect, were laid out on a sandstone ridge across the summit and steepest convex shoulder positions.  The thickness of the O, A and E horizons was not related to slope gradient across soils on all slope gradients and aspects.  This indicates that the present rate of soil formation is greater than erosion, the influence of erosion on steep slopes could be off-set by lateral movement of through-flow water above the B horizon, or the process of tree throw masks slope gradient effects.  Solum depth, B horizon thickness, clay, Fe, and Al indexes decreased with increasing slope for both the NW and SW aspects.  Organic carbon index decreased with increasing slope for the SW aspect.  Decreases in effective precipitation over relatively larger surface areas at steep versus lower slope gradients, a longer influence of periglacial erosion following the Wisconsinan glacial advance, and present slow but significant soil creep could cause these differences in soil development across the slope.  Solum depth, B horizon thickness, clay, Fe, and Al indexes showed a smaller decrease across the NW compared to the SW slope.  Organic carbon did not decrease across the NW slope.  The E horizon was also slightly thicker on the NW compared to the SW slope.  These aspect differences were probably caused by less evaporation on "shaded" NW compared to "sunny" SW slopes which produce generally higher moisture levels and more effective eluviation and illuviation on the NW slope.

AB This paper reviews current knowledge on the range and extent of various tillage systems used in North America with special reference to the effects on soil properties, the erosion hazard and water quality.  The increasing adoption of conservation-tillage systems since their introduction in the early 1960s follows an enhanced awareness of the increasing risks of soil erosion and non-point source pollution and the high cost of fuel with conventional tillage.  Most "conventional tillage" systems encompass complete inversion tillage along with several secondary and tertiary tillage methods.  In contrast, conservation-tillage systems involve streamlining various farm operations, thereby reducing the frequency and intensity of the soil manipulative operations.  Reduction in tillage intensity has been accompanied by the development of rotations and cropping systems, methods of surface and internal drainage, fertilizer technology and pest management alternatives.
   The status of antecedent soil physical properties is an important factor affecting the choice of tillage systems.  Important soil physical properties governing the choice of tillage systems include soil wetness and anaerobiosis, soil temperature and soil structure including its susceptibility to compaction, crusting or erosion.  Tillage systems affect soil physical, chemical and biological properties.  Among drastic tillage-induced changes in soil properties are bulk density, infiltration rate, aggregation and aggregate size distribution, soil organic carbon and nutrient profile, microbial activity and species diversity, and the population of earthworms.  Macropores and biochannels are usually more prevalent in conservation-tillage than conventional-tillage systems.  Conservation tillage induces stratification of soil organic matter and related nutrients, enhances the activity of soil fauna and leads to acidification.  The magnitude of these changes depends on the soil type, the cropping systems and the type of conservation tillage adopted.  Soil organic carbon and nutrient stratification are generally more pronounced in coarse-textures than in clayey soils.  Conservation tillage is also associated with greater biomass pool size.  The latter affects the nutrient response curves of the soil.  Nitrification and denitrification are other important processes affected by tillage systems.
   The widespread adaption of conservation-tillage systems, although beneficial in controlling off-site sedimentation, has raised concerns about the potential for increased leaching of nutrients and pesticides to groundwater.  Important pollutants associated with conservation tillage are nitrate and pesticides.  Some studies have shown little effect of tillage on losses of pesticides.  Conservation tillage may suppress crop yields, especially on heavy textured soil with poor internal drainage and in those prone to soil compaction caused by vehicular traffic.

AB Soil particle size distribution, bulk density, water desorption, water-stable aggregates greater than 0.25 mm, Cs-137 content, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N(t)), sodium-bicarbonate-soluble phosphorus (P(a)), exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity, were measured in three contrasting soils that had lost soil by erosion and tillage to different degrees.  Included were sites that had been used in an erosion study between 1946 and 1959 at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa.  The amount of soil loss was calculated from Cs-137 loss and depths to contrasting layers, and deposition was estimated from the depths of Ap horizons.  Soil loss was closely related to slope position and land use.  Contents of OC, N(t), and P(a) were reduced by soil loss.  They were not restored at the medium- and coarse-textured sites after 17 years of continuous grass cover, but OC and N(t), and aggregate stability, were restored at the fine-textured site after 27 years of grass cover.

ID TOPSOIL REMOVAL; SOIL COHESION; WATER-CONTENT; CARBON; TIME; CORN
AB Aggregate stability is a measure of the ability of soil to withstand the disrupting forces of rain and nonsymmetrical wetting.  Erosion may influence aggregate stability by exposing soil with properties different than the original soil surface.  This study was conducted to determine:  (i) the influence of antecedent soil water content on wet aggregate stability using aggregates prehumidified to near saturation; (ii) the effects of organic C and clay content on the soil water content-aggregate stability relationship; and (iii) the effect of topsoil removal on aggregate stability.  Seventy-eight soil samples were taken from six profiles of Beadle clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic, Typic Argiustoll).  These samples were analyzed for pH, organic C, texture, CaCO3, antecedent soil water content, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and aggregate stability.  Isolated test plots were also saturated with an overhead sprinkling infiltrometer.  Samples were taken periodically throughout a 4-d period for aggregate-stability determination.  A modified wet sieving technique, which included prehumidifying of the sample to near saturation, was used to determine aggregate stability.  A negative linear relationship was found between aggregate stability of prehumidified aggregates and antecedent soil water content.  Prediction equations were developed that explain up to 77% of variability for the aggregate stability.  Organic C was the most important of the independent variables, followed by antecedent soil water content in the multiple regression analysis.  Topsoil removal by desurfacing and erosion reduced aggregate stability.  Aggregate stabilities for soils with high organic C and clay content were less affected by antecedent soil water content.

   REGENERATION; SOIL EROSION
AB Shrubland vegetation and environmental data in western Shewa, Ethiopia have been analysed.  Vegetation data include cover-abundance values of vascular plant species; environmental data comprise physical and chemical properties of the soil, altitude, slope, grazing and browsing pressure.
   The vegetation data were subjected to hierarchical and non-hierarchical classification and ordination with correspondence analysis.  The classification resulted in seven different vegetation types, ranging from grassland with scattered shrubs to degenerated forest.  Ordination of the data and biplot analysis showed that the vegetation is influenced by anthropogenic factors and altitudinal variation.  Sand content is related to a low level of anthropogenic influence whereas silt content is related to a high level.  This is explained by historical events rather than by the present situation.  Total nitrogen, organic carbon, altitude and slope are positively correlated and these variables are negatively related to anthropogenic influences.
   The shrubland vegetation may have expanded from lower altitudes and drier sites as forests gradually disappeared.
   The recovery of an economically more rewarding vegetation type may be achieved through providing alternative sources of fuel and construction and through prohibiting cultivation and grazing in the shrublands on the hillsides.  Regeneration can be accelerated by actively introducing seedlings of tree species that do not need a heavy canopy cover for establishment and growth.

AB It has been investigated in which ways sugar beet growing is involved in modern farming, being intentionally adjusted to the demands of environmental protection.
   The following aspects have been illuminated by describing and evaluating present methods of beet growing in Germany:
   1.  Approaches to avoding soil erosion by new techniques of soil preparation and sowing
   2.  Reduction of soil compaction by wheel pressure
   3.  Ways to and success of diminishing the amount of mineral fertilizer applied to the beet
   4.  Overcoming incorrect application of organic manure, especially slurry
   5.  Ways of limiting the use of pesticides by observing the principle of integrated plant protection
   6.  Restricted use of herbicides as an indispensable tool of economic beet growing also in future
   7.  Making best use of the remaining beet leaf and of the soil adhering to the root after harvest (principle of recycling)
   8.  Taking full advantage of carbonation lime (sugar factory lime; "Carbokalk") as fertilizer and soil stabilizer.

AB This paper does not describe the future course of soil science in the tropics.  Rather, it is concerned with some soil-related issues that tropical countries will have to face, and resolve, in the short and medium term.  The topics chosen for discussion here are deforestation, the resultant degradation of the soil resource, and soil management for continuous crop production, with particular reference to the humid tropics.
   Tropical forests are being lost at a rate of at least 10 million hectares per annum, most of which occurs through conversion to agriculture.  The removal of a vegetative cover, depletion of soil nutrients and organic matter, and accelerated erosion have led to drastic declines in soil productivity.  The tropical uplands, into which future expansion of the cultivated area should largely occur, are particularly vulnerable to erosion once their forest cover has been removed.  In releasing about a quarter of the global CO2 emission to the atmosphere, the large-scale clearing of tropical forests also contributes significantly to the "greenhouse effect".  Another consequence of forest destruction, especially of tropical rainforests, is the loss of biological diversity.
   Soil management for sustainable land use is discussed in the context of various cultivation systems.  Shifting cultivation is a stable but extensive system of land use, providing for the subsistence of only a few people per unit area of forested land.  Because of rising populations and expectations, this traditional farming system is being increasingly supplanted by more permanent and intensive methods of cultivation.  Nevertheless, by leaving the litter and undergrowth intact during land clearing operations and practicing appropriate post-clearing soil management, continuous cropping could be sustained in lowland areas with relatively deep soils.  In the uplands, however, where the soils are often shallow and easily erodible, agro-forestry appears to be a better alternative in terms of soil conservation.
   The development and implementation of sustainable farming systems in order to arrest, if not reverse, soil degradation must rest on the willing cooperation of the people involved.  Soil conservation programs should not only be acceptable to, but also be compatible with the socio-economic aspirations and conditions of the local community.

AB Two soils derived from glacial deposits and one from alluvium were examined for changes in organic matter (OM) and nitrogen levels between 1943 and 1983 across the international boundary in the Fraser Lowland of western North America.  Duplicate samples were collected from the upper 0.2 m from 60 randomly selected sites on the five land clearing periods (1943-1955, 1955-1966, 1966-1976, 1976-1983, uncleared) on each of three parent materials: glacial outwash, alluvium, and glacialmarine deposits in the United States and Canada.  The land clearing periods were determined from medium scale aerial photographs taken in 1943, 1955, 1966, 1976, and 1983.  Cultivation results in a 20% loss of OM after 35 yr on all soils.  The largest loss is in the first 15 yr on all soils.  Changes in N levels on the three parent materials is irregular.  C:N narrows on all soils from about 15:1 to about 12:1.

TI SOIL PROPERTIES EFFECT ON RANDOM ROUGHNESS DECAY BY RAINFALL
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULATOR; EROSION
AB Rainfall modifies random roughness (RR) at varying rates for different soils.  Methods to estimate RR decay are needed for computer models which simulate physical processes occurring at or near the soil surface.  The objective of this study was to estimate RR decay curves as a function of soil properties.  Surface roughness has been reported for selected soils before and after simulated rainfall (5 to 80 mm on five soils, 35 to 300 mm on one soil) and before and after natural rainfall (7 to 350 mm on two soils).  The soils represent a wide range of textural and physical properties.  A modified exponential function was fit to normalized RR values (RR after rainfall/initial RR) using rainfall amount as an independent variable.  The coefficients of this function were then approximated as a function of two soil properties:  percentage organic carbon and percentage clay.  Surface stability increased with greater amounts of organic carbon.  Surface stability increased with clay content to about 31% and then decreased with greater amounts of clay.  Random roughness decay curves may be estimated for specific soils by using the exponential function.

AB Organic geochemical studies of 12 soil samples from Wright and Taylor Valleys of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, were carried out.  Long-chain n-alkanois acids (C20-C34), with a predominance of even-carbon numbers, were abundant in all the samples.  3-Hydroxy acids (C-8-C30) with a predominance of even-carbon numbers were found in the samples, together with 2-, omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxy acids.  alpha,omega-Dicarboxylic acids (C-8-C31) were detected having near-unity values of carbon preference indices; mainly the C-13 dicarboxylic acid predominated.  Visual kerogen revealed that amorphous materials are major components (68-98%) with small amounts of very fine coals (2-32%), but no woody and herbaceous materials.  The occurrence of mature isomers of steranes and triterpanes, the paucity of n-alkenoic acids and data from the microscopic study suggest that organic components in the soil samples are derived from erosion of Beacon Supergroup sedimentary rocks and past biological debris containing vascular plant waxes as well as wind-transported cyanobacterial mats, including cyanobacteria, microalgae, bacteria and fungi, rather than from living organisms.
