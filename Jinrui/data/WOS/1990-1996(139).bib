Abstract = {{Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of
   carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally.
   The EPIC (Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator) model was used to
   examine the sensitivity of soil erosion (wind, water) and soil organic
   carbon (SOC) (15 cm and 1 m depth) across the US corn belt to changes in
   temperature (+2 degrees C), precipitation (+/-10\%, +/-20\%), wind speed
   (+/-10\%, +/-20\%), and atmospheric CO2 concentration (350, 625 ppmv).
   One-hundred-year simulations were run for each of 100 sites under 36
   climate/CO2 regimes. The 100-year regionally aggregated mean water
   erosion rates increased linearly with precipitation, whereas the wind
   erosion rates decreased and total erosion rates increased by 15-18\%.
   Total erosion increased with increased temperature. Increasing CO2 from
   350 to 625 ppmv (with temperature increased by 2 degrees C and mean wind
   speed held constant) had no effect on water erosion, despite increases
   in annual total and peak runoff; this was attributed to increased
   vegetation cover. Wind erosion decreased by 4-11\% under increased CO2.
   Wind erosion was very sensitive to mean wind speed, increasing four-fold
   and decreasing 10-fold for a 20\% increase or decrease in mean wind
   speed, respectively. This was attributed to a threshold effect. SOC to 1
   m decreased 4.8 Mg-C ha(-1) from an initial value of 18.1 Mg-C ha(-1)
   during the 100-year baseline simulation. About 50\% of this loss (2.3
   Mg-C ha(-1)) was due to transport off-site by soil erosion. SOC in the
   top 15 cm decreased 0.8 Mg-C ha(-1) from an initial value of 4.9 Mg-C
   ha(-1). Increased temperature and precipitation accelerated these losses
   of SOC, whereas increased CO2 slowed the losses. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{This study addresses the temporal distribution of forms of phosphorus in
   the soil of a temporarily flooded riparian forest of the valley of the
   river Garonne (Southwest of France). A sequential extraction for forms
   of phosphorus of increasing chemical stability was used. During the
   study period (13 months), the forest was flooded a few days during March
   and May. In winter, resin-Pi concentration was high (26 mu g g(-1)) in
   comparison to spring values (<9 mu g g(-1)). NaHCO3-Po, NaHCO3-Pi or
   NaOH-Pi concentrations increased during winter (up to 74, 124 and 78 mu
   g g(-1) respectively) and decreased significantly during spring (32, 44
   and 32 mu g g(-1) respectively). This pattern was attributed to
   simultaneous mineralization and plant uptake during the growing season
   and to the flood events (erosional processes and P-release). During
   summer and fall, resin-Pi concentration increased significantly (up to
   26 mu g g(-1) in October). NaHCO3-Po concentrations remained low during
   spring and summer (<33 mu g g(-1)), and increased significantly in fall
   (>45 mu g g(-1)). NaHCO3-Pi or NaOH-Pi increased in late spring or
   summer (90 mu g g(-1) and 68 mu g g(-1) respectively). Increasing
   concentrations of the labile forms during late spring or summer were
   ascribed to the warm temperature and soil dryness that limited plant
   growth. HCl-Pi increased regularly after the floods (174 mu g g(-1)
   before the flood events to 254 mu g g(-1) after the floods). Residual P
   presented a similar pattern i.e. 214 mu g g(-1) and 279 mu g g(-1)
   respectively before and after the flood events. This pattern was
   attributed to a progressive incorporation of flood deposits to the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Rainsplash is an important component of interrill erosion. To date, few
   studies have critically examined the linkages between aggregate
   entrainment by splash and associated nutrient flux. An Oxisol was used
   in laboratory rainfall experiments with two different antecedent
   moisture contents (AMC) and ten different rainfall energy flux densities
   (EFD). Splash and soil organic carbon (SOC) flux increased with
   increased EFD regardless of initial AMC. Aggregates were not transported
   in proportion to their content in the original soil matrix, those of
   2000-4000 mu m and < 105 mu m were found to be the most resistant to
   splash. Energy required to detach 1 gC varied from a median of 1870 J
   for the 2000-4000 mu m fraction to 120 J for the 425-850 mu m fraction.
   Temporal variation in cumulative splash flux and carbon flux for various
   combinations of AMC and EFD indicated distinct patterns. Under dry AMC,
   splash increased during 1 h duration storms and this was explained by
   increased aggregate breakdown by air-slaking, decreased soil strength
   and increased erodibility as soil moisture increased. Wet soil runs
   exhibited the opposite pattern of decreased flux with time, probably
   indicating a complex response to limited aggregate availability,
   increased seal development by raindrop compaction, and transient water
   layer effects in drop impact craters. The formulation of mass-based SOC
   enrichment ratios CER) clearly indicated preferential detachment and
   transport of splashed aggregates between 250 and 2000 mu m. A reliance
   of chemical transport models on concentration-based ER values can be
   misleading, because it is the balance between nutrient concentration and
   sediment quantity that is important for soil quality and non-point
   source modelling.}},

Abstract = {{We examined soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in a shortgrass steppe
   ecosystem along spatial gradients in plant inputs and temporal gradients
   in disturbance age because a better understanding of decay
   characteristics of SOM pools may improve our ability to predict
   ecosystem responses ra perturbation. We assessed measurable pools of SOM
   that are thought to correspond to active, intermediate, and passive SOM
   based upon turnover characteristics in three separate experiments. In a
   first, we evaluated SOM pools along a spatial gradient in plant inputs,
   from locations under individual bunch grasses to natural areas of plant
   removal (ant mounds). In a second experiment we assessed SOM pools
   across a temporal gradient in ant mounds ranging from approximate to 5
   to 60 yr old. Finally, we compared our results from the second
   experiment to a single human-induced plant-removal experiment.
   We found that reduced root biomass accounted for up to 90\% of the
   variation in SOM across our spatial gradients. In our examination of
   temporal dynamics of SOM, we found that locations with little or no
   plant inputs for approximate to 45 yr had 28\% less total soil C than in
   native areas with average plant cover. We measured the greatest
   proportional losses (48-78\%) of SOM in response to reduced plant inputs
   (over 30-60 yr) in the active SOM as indexed by C and N mineralization
   and microbial biomass C and N. The range of losses from intermediate
   organic matter as indexed by particulate organic matter (POM) ranged
   from 38 to 73\%, and losses from the passive pool were proportionately
   lower (57\%). Though this general pattern follows the course predicted
   by theory, and our measurements of turnover of intermediate SOM agree
   closely with models, results indicate a considerably slower turnover
   rate for the active pool and a considerably faster rate for the passive
   pool than expected. We compared our field estimates of
   plant-removal-induced SOM losses to simulation modeling results and
   cultivation studies. Our comparison of field results to Century model
   simulations indicated a possible model overestimation of the impact of
   plant removal on SOM loss. By comparing our plant-removal results to
   studies of cultivation-induced losses of SOM on the shortgrass steppe,
   we found that plant-removal is not as severe a disturbance as cropping,
   likely as a result of physical disturbances associated with tillage such
   as surface erosion and disturbance of soil aggregate structure.}},

Abstract = {{Bench-terracing and Pinus afforestation have been extensively adopted as
   a means of soil conservation in Spain. This paper questions the
   appropriateness of this technology to extensively gullied soils and
   sediments of the Rana formation of central Spain. Bench-terracing has
   markedly altered the characteristics of the surface soil horizon as
   compared with nearby undisturbed matorral (natural scrub) vegetation.
   The construction process and resultant bench-terrace morphology have
   imposed a new, more spatially structured pattern in soil properties
   giving enhanced opportunities for overland flow generation and erosion.
   The terracing has exposed subsurface Bt horizons on inner treads and
   lower risers, producing a very compact clay rich surface horizon, low in
   organic carbon and of poor structural stability. Despite subsoiling
   hydraulic conductivity is very low. Excavated soil material is ploughed
   sideways to partially bury the original surface horizon and form part of
   the next riser downslope. Downslope drainage on the terraces gives rise
   to soil moisture contents approaching saturation on the lower risers and
   treads. Consequently only small rainfall inputs are required to initiate
   pending and overland flow generation on sloping treads. Rainfall
   simulation demonstrates the importance of antecedent soil moisture to
   runoff generation, and the role of vegetation and organic matter in
   retaining water. Erosion bridge measurements show that erosion rates on
   sloping treads are as high as those recorded on gully sidewalls. Gully
   sidewall erosion is also accelerated by runoff waters shed from terrace
   treads. Management of native matorral vegetation may provide a more
   sustainable approach to soil conservation than bench terracing with
   afforestation.}},

Abstract = {{High concentrations of N, P, and organic C in water cause problems such
   as excessive eutrophication in reservoirs and bacterial growth in
   distribution systems. The aim of this study was to measure the export of
   N, P, and organic C in streams draining two grazed catchments with no
   point sources in the Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia, during 1 yr.
   Retreat Valley catchment (1.3 km(2)) is grazed by sheep, has steep
   topography, and loam over clay soils. Lawless catchment (3.0 km(2)) is
   Batter, grazed by dairy cattle, and has sand over clay soils. Rainfall
   and specific runoff were similar. Annual exports were 924 kg suspended
   solids ha(-1), 9.0 kg N ha(-1), 1.0 kg P ha(-1), and 55 kg organic C
   ha(-1) from Retreat Valley; and 40 kg suspended solids ha(-1), 6.6 kg N
   ha(-1), 1.1 kg P ha(-1), and 66 kg organic C ha(-1) from Lawless. In
   Retreat Valley, 33\% of the N, 86\% of the P, and 65\% of the organic C
   was in particulate forms resulting from erosion; and 45\% of the N was
   nitrate. In Lawless, 82\% of the N, 76\% of the P, and 92\% of the
   organic C was dissolved. Of the dissolved N, approximately 93\% was
   organic. Concentrations of P in both streams, and dissolved organic C in
   Lawless, exceeded desirable limits. A combination of management options,
   including management of grazing and fertilizer application, soil
   amendment, and subsurface drainage, could lead to reductions in nutrient
   exports.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion has been shown to result in decreased crop yields and
   reduced agricultural sustainability (Mississippi Agriculture and
   Forestry Experiment Station Technical Bulletin, 1989; Littleboy et al.,
   1992; and Craft et al., 1992). To address the problems associated with
   soil erosion, Congress passed the Food Security Act in 1985. To comply
   with this law, farmers must implement conservation plans on highly
   erodible land to `'significantly reduce'' erosion rates.
   One widely used method of soil conservation is no-tillage agriculture.
   But water runoff is reduced under conservation tillage and infiltration
   increases, possibly resulting in more pesticide movement through the
   unsaturated zone into the groundwater (Gish et al., 1991 and Donigian
   and Carsel, 1987). Most research suggests that pesticide sorption to
   soil is primarily a function of pesticide partitioning into the soil
   organic matter rather than adsorption into the total soil mass
   (Karickoff et al., 1979). The addition of commercially composted yard
   waste when mixed with soil to increase the organic carbon content and
   adding to soil surface to reduce erosion and water runoff may reduce
   pesticide loading to groundwater compared to no-till.
   Surface applied organic mulches in general have been shown to reduce
   soil erosion (Adams, 1966; Kramer and Meyer, 1969; and Vleeschauwer et
   al., 1978). Yard waste compost in particular has been shown to reduce
   erosion when surface applied (Ettlin and Stewart, 1993). Since
   beneficial uses are needed for yard waste compost (BioCycle Guide to
   Yard Waste Composting, 1989a and 1989b), adding compost to high value
   horticultural fields should provide a beneficial use for an ever
   increasing waste product.
   Research comparing pesticide runoff in no-till versus conventional-till
   have been mixed. Kenimer et al. (1987) concluded that no-till may reduce
   pesticide loading to surface water while Sauer and Daniel (1987)
   reported no significant differences. Both reported that any reduction in
   pesticide runoff is due to reduced water runoff (pesticide runoff
   concentration was found to be larger in no-till). A compost amended soil
   should also show the benefit of reduced runoff compared to
   conventional-till and may show reduced pesticide runoff concentration
   compared to no-till due to pesticide sorption to organic carbon.
   Metribuzin
   {[}4-amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-(methylthio)-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one]
   has the potential to be transported into the environment(USEPA, 1992,
   exhibit 4-1 and USEPA, 1985) and it is used to control broadleaf weeds
   in tomato production (University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension
   Service, 1992). The use of yard waste compost to reduce erosion will be
   beneficial in horticulture due to the value and scale of production.
   The objectives of this research were to study the influence of three
   soil treatments: 1) yard waste compost amended soil with compost added
   to soil surface after rototilling, CA; 2) no-till, NT and; 3)
   conventional-till, CT on metribuzin concentration and loading to surface
   water via runoff and in sediment}},

Abstract = {{Crop residue management is a key consideration when attempting to
   optimize fertility in conservation tillage systems. Major factors
   affecting the impact of crop residues on nutrient availability include
   the chemical composition of the residue {[}e.g. carbon (C) to nitrogen
   (N) ratio], residue placement, fertilizer placement in relation to
   residue and time. Greater surface accumulation of crop residues in
   reduced and no-till systems tends to slow decomposition of N-poor
   residues such as cereal straw, and crop N supply during the current year
   can be reduced by immobilization if the straw is incorporated close to
   the time of high crop demand. Similarly, placement of fertilizer
   directly in the surface straw residue can reduce fertilizer use
   efficiency due to greater immobilization. Greater immobilization in
   reduced and no-till systems can enhance the conservation of soil and
   fertilizer N in the long term, with higher initial N fertilizer
   requirements decreasing over time because of 1) reduced losses by
   erosion and 2) the build-up of a larger poor of readily mineralizable
   organic N. For N-rich residues, such as legumes, volatilization losses
   may be greater when these residues are left on the surface than when
   incorporated into soil. Leaching of soluble phosphorus and sulfur
   compounds from standing and surface-placed crop residues into the
   mineral soil below may be a significant pathway for recycling of these
   elements in no-till systems. Greater coverage of the soil surface by
   crop residues can increase soil moisture and affect soil biological
   activity related to nutrient turnover. Future research should address
   how above and below-ground decomposition processes differ for a wider
   range of crop residues and nutrients, emphasizing both short and
   long-term nutrient recycling.}},

Abstract = {{Soil conservation and sustainability concerns, and a lack of markets for

   residue export beyond cattle feed or livestock bedding. With the
   increasing producer use of minimum and zero-tillage systems, the
   management of crop residues has become an important issue. Opportunities
   for residue removal may exist provided markets are developed for the
   material and long-term soil sustainability concerns are addressed.
   Recent research on the effect-of residue removal in Saskatchewan has
   shown that there is little or no impact on soil organic matter provided
   adequate fertilization is practised and tillage is reduced. Assuming
   that 750 kg ha(-1) of retained residue is adequate for erosion
   protection in reduced tillage systems, significant quantities of
   residues may be available for export from the Black Soil zone. The
   economic returns to producers are such that residue export is an
   attractive diversification option.}},

Journal = {{HOLOCENE}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{We used palaeolimnological techniques to examine effects of Holocene
   climate change and human influence on lakes of the Yucatan Peninsula,
   Mexico. The three study lakes are located along a west-east transect
   that represents a gradient of increasing modern precipitation and
   density of former Maya settlement. At Lake Coba, an 880-cm sediment core
   yields a complete record of lacustrine sedimentation that began when the
   lake first filled similar to 8000 BP as groundwater level rose in
   response to rising sea level and increased precipitation. Diatom,
   ostracod, and delta(18)O evidence indicate that Lake Coba was initially
   shallow and saline. Coba, presently in the region of greatest rainfall,
   showed more episodic water-level changes than Lake San Jose Chulchaca or
   Lake Sayaucil. High lake level and fresh water were evident at 440 cm
   (similar to 2600 BP), followed by a decline in water levels and an
   increase in total ionic salinity to the present time. In a 613-cm core
   from Sayaucil, in the intermediate precipitation zone, total salinity
   was high between 600 and 400 cm (similar to 3050 and 2000 BP), followed
   by consistently higher water levels. Salinity was high in the lower
   portion of a 110-cm San Jose Chulchaca core (beginning similar to 1860
   BP), followed by a gradual and consistent freshening of water to the
   present time.
   Trophic state changes and human influence on lakes were evaluated using
   diatom, delta(18)O, total P, sedimentary organic matter, and preliminary
   pollen data. Maximal human disturbance at Lake Coba, a densely settled
   Maya urban site, occurred during a deep-water event at 440 cm, followed
   by a decline in human influence and trophic state to the present time.
   Trophic state and linear sedimentation rates in Sayaucil increased
   significantly above 400 cm (after similar to 2000 BP), probably
   associated with initial Maya settlement near Xtojil and subsequent
   small-scale farming. Limnological disturbance may have preceded the
   period of maximal human occupation because initial land clearance and
   consequent soil erosion probably affected water quality substantially.
   San Jose Chulchaca lacks archaeological evidence of human occupation in
   the drainage, and shows gradual changes in trophic state not caused by
   human disturbance. With the exception of a C-14 date on wood from the
   base of the Coba core, C-14 dates and chronologies may be artificially
   old as a consequence of hard-water-lake error. Trophic state changes in
   the study lakes were generally consistent with known patterns of human
   settlement and population change. Late-Holocene water-level fluctuations
   were most pronounced in Lake Coba in eastern Yucatan, where modern
   rainfall is currently greatest, but lake level is generally lower than
   during much of the past. Lake level was relatively constant in Sayaucil
   in the central peninsula, whereas lake level in San Jose Chulchaca in
   the arid western portion of the peninsula increased gradually over time.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion to conservation tillage systems increases soil C content by
   reducing soil erosion and the rate of organic matter oxidation, We
   hypothesized that these effects could impact soil emission of CO2, This
   study (i) determined if CO2 emissions were reduced in the first years
   after conversion to no-tillage (NT) relative to conventional tillage
   (CT), (ii) evaluated whether differences in soil CO2 emissions between
   tillage treatments were related to soil temperature differences, and
   (iii) determined if soil CO2 emission measurements provided an early
   estimate of soil management practice impact on soil organic C, In 1992
   and 1993, CT and NT plots were planted to small-grain cereals in Ottawa,
   Ontario, on a Dalhousie silt loam (mixed, mesic, Typic Endoaquoll).
   Fluxes were measured using closed chambers connected to a portable CO2
   analyzer, During growing season 1992, the CO2 emissions varied from 0.05
   to 0.18 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) with an average of 0.12 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)
   for CT and of 0.10 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for NT. In 1993, the CO2 emissions
   varied from 0.06 to 0.35 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) with an average of 0.15 mg
   CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in both tillage treatments, Differences in soil CO2
   fluxes between treatments were related to differences in soil
   temperature (r(2) = 0.62), giving an estimate of 75 g C m(-2) yr(-1)
   difference in organic C transfers to the atmosphere between CT and NT.
   These results were validated using an independent estimation derived
   from long-term field experiments, Thus, soil CO2 flux measurements using
   dynamic closed chambers can provide early estimates of soil management
   impacts on soil organic C.}},

Abstract = {{Although accelerated rainfall runoff and soil erosion in inhabited
   mountain regions are often linked to cultivation practices on steep
   hillsides, fields that have been abandoned can pose an even greater risk
   of rapid runoff and soil erosion. This paper presents new evidence of
   land degradation resulting from land abandonment in the Ecuadorian Andes
   and examines the Andean case in light of recent research on land
   abandonment from the Pyrenees and Himalaya. The Ecuadorian data, based
   on 109 field rainfall simulation experiments, indicate that runoff and
   erosion rates on abandoned/fallow fields are significantly higher than
   those of cultivated lands. Analyses of total percent carbon show
   abandoned/fallow field soil samples to contain significantly less
   organic matter than those under other land uses. Continued degradation
   and high runoff coefficients in abandoned/fallow fields in both the
   Andes and the Pyrenees are linked to the ongoing, informal use of these
   lands for grazing. Active management strategies are required to reverse
   the resulting scenario of increasing land degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The subhumid zone Alfisols of Nigeria are fragile, dominated by
   low-activity clays,; and have inherently moderate to low fertility
   status. Following intensive use of the soils for crop and livestock
   production, the soils are being degraded by soil erosion, drought,
   complete removal of both crop and residues, improper management
   practices, and overgrazing. The present investigation was aimed at
   defining the soil properties and arresting their continued degradation.
   The study area is located in the savanna zone, near Kaduna, Nigeria. The
   study involved a reconnaissance survey at which four soil units were
   delineated. Typical profiles were studied in detail, characterized in
   the field and in samples obtained for physical or chemical analysis. The
   upland soils (crest to upper, upper to middle, and middle to lower slope
   positions) have shallow Ap, sandy clay loam and clay loam texture, and
   are plinthic and mottled in the subsoil horizons. The valley basin soils
   are loam, have a moderately thick surface horizon, are flooded at a
   shallow depth of 50 cm, and are mottled even at the surface horizons.
   Acidity of the upland soils is in the extremely acid range (pH
   4.4.-4.8). In the valley basin, soil acidity is in the strongly acid
   range (pH 5.0-5.1). Organic carbon and total nitrogen values of the
   soils are generally moderate at the surface but decrease to low and very
   low values in the subsurface horizons. Cation exchange capacities of the
   soils are adequate to control leaching losses of soil nutrients,
   especially at the surface horizons.}},

Abstract = {{The amounts and types of extractable hydrocarbon components in sediment
   cores from the Rochester Basin of eastern Lake Ontario provide a record
   of environmental changes that have accompanied the settlement and
   population growth of the surrounding land areas. Sediments deposited
   prior to the mid-1800s contain low concentrations of hydrocarbons that
   are dominated by land-plant wax components. Concentrations begin to rise
   in the late 1800s as erosion of soil and nutrients from watershed areas
   accelerated. This pattern continues into modern times. Episodes of
   enhanced aquatic productivity are sometimes recorded in
   twentieth-century sediments by the dominance of algal hydrocarbons, but
   land-plant components typically predominate. Petroleum residues begin to
   appear in sediments deposited in the late 1800's but remain minor
   constituents of the hydrocarbon contents of modern sediments in the
   Rochester Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Five riparian herbaceous plants, Leonotis nepetaefolia, Cassia tora,
   Ageratum conyzoides, Parthenium hysterophorus and Sida acuta, dominant
   on the banks of the Rihand river at Renukoot (India), were selected to
   assess experimentally their quantitative role in conserving organic-C,
   Na, K and Ca. Young seedlings from the river bank were planted on
   sloping experimental plots made of alluvial soil. Simulated rainfall
   totalling 42.5 mm was applied at 300 mm h(-1) on five vegetated and one
   bare plots. Runoff water and eroded soil were collected from each
   experimental plot in artificial reservoirs and their quantities were
   measured. The soil conservation value of the five selected species
   ranged between 33 and 84\% while the water conservation value varied
   between 19 and 50\%. The overall nutrient conservation value, based on
   the losses in runoff water and eroded soil taken together, varied from
   30 to 83\% for organic-C, 19 to 78\% for Na, 13 to 72\% for K and 29 to
   52\% for Ca under different species. Loss of these four nutrients in
   response to 42.5 mm simulated rainfall was much higher than their input
   through rainfall. Loss value for the nutrients were in following order:
   organic-C > Ca > K > Na. The fraction of organic-C transported down the
   slope was higher in eroded soil (averaging 73\%) and of exchangeable
   bases in runoff water (averaging 86\% for Na, 82\% for K and 90\% for
   Ca). Flow-weighted concentrations of all the studied nutrients were
   consistently greater from bare stands. Number of fine roots was found to
   play greater role in the case of organic-C (92\%; p < 0.01) and Na
   (70\%; p < 0.05) runoff and their conservation by different plant
   species but canopy cover played greater role for K (58\%; p < 0.08) and
   Ca (90\%; p < 0.01).}},

Abstract = {{Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of
   CO2 and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally. The Climate
   Change Action Plan commits the USA to reducing net greenhouse gas
   emissions by 106 x 10(6) Mg C yr(-1) by the year 2000. One suggestion
   for reducing net emissions is to convert marginal grass pastures to pine
   (Pinus spp.) plantations in the South-Central USA. We used the
   Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model to estimate the
   amount of atmospheric C that could be sequestered by this suggested
   change in land use. Carbon flow dynamics at each of 100 randomly
   selected sites were simulated for 50 yr under two assumptions: (i)
   continuous pasture for 50 yr or (ii) pine plantations harvested every 25
   yr. Carbon sequestered by conversion to pine plantations was calculated
   as the net change in off-site storage (i.e., in long-lived products and
   landfills), plus the change in soil organic C, plus (for the first
   harvest period) stand establishment. Average C-sequestration (+/-SE) was
   40 +/- 2 and 18 +/- 2 Mg C ha(-1) for the first and second 25-yr harvest
   periods, respectively, In contrast, sequestration would have been 8.3
   +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) as soil organic C if the sites had been left in
   continuous pasture for 50 yr, or 3 Mg C ha(-1) after correcting for
   release of C during manufacture of N-fertilizer. Extrapolated to the
   region, conversion of 3.6 x 10(6) ha of marginal grass pasture to pine
   plantations could sequester 5.6 x 10(6) C yr(-1) for the first 25 yr and
   1.1 x 10(6) Mg for the second 25 yr. If all types of marginal
   agricultural land in the region (4.6 x 10(6) ha) were converted to
   forestry, the corresponding sequestration rates would be 7.4 x 10(6) and
   1.4 x 10(6) Mg C yr(-1). In contrast, maintaining the land in continuous
   pasture would sequester 0.3 x 10(6) Mg C yr(-1).}},

Abstract = {{There is a comparatively large dry aeolian deposition in Negev Desert.
   The aim of this study was to quantify the contribution of this
   deposition and of deposited C and N pools. Amounts of aeolian dry
   deposition and airborne particle concentration near the ground were
   measured. Total N and dissolvable organic C were determined in the
   deposited soil surface layer and in airborne particles. The annual mean
   airborne particle concentration during 3 years varied from 100 to 113 mu
   g m(-3). The deposited airborne particle accumulation (difference
   between the total deposition and deflation-erosion) varied from 110 to
   220 g m(-1) yr(-1) at the two sites studied. The C and N content in the
   airborne particles and in the dry deposit was significantly higher in
   the loessical site than in the lithosol site. Considering the
   differences in the amounts of total dry deposition and the deposited C
   and N, it becomes possible to address the ecological role of the dry
   deposition in the ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Stable oxygen and carbon isotope data from a lacustrine sequence at
   Graenge, southeast Denmark, revealed distinct environmental changes
   related to Late Weichselian climatic development in the region.
   Comparison of isotopic records obtained from sedimentary carbonates and
   freshwater molluscs enabled reconstruction of changes in the lacustrine
   environment. The degree of thermal and chemical stratification of the
   lake was evaluated and supported by pollen data from an earlier study of
   the site. During the Allerod interstadial, dimictic and stagnant
   conditions characterized the lake, whereas the stratification was
   disturbed during the Younger Dryas stadial probably as a result of
   deforestation and increased wind impact. The origin of sedimentary
   carbonates was examined by mineralogic and morphologic studies. A
   considerable input of clastics and detrital carbonates, associated with
   pronounced enrichment of O-18 and C-13, was recorded in the Younger
   Dryas sediments indicating soil degradation and increased erosion. A
   climatic warming preceding the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary is clearly
   reflected in the different stable isotope records and in the
   lithostratigraphy.}},

Abstract = {{For a large set of major world rivers we established the empirical
   relations existing between the observed organic carbon fluxes and the
   climatic, biologic, and geomorphologic patterns characterizing the river
   basins. These characteristics were extracted from various ecological
   databases. The corresponding carbon fluxes were taken from the
   literature. Dissolved organic carbon fluxes are mainly related to
   drainage intensity, basin slope, and the amount of carbon stored in
   soils. Particulate organic carbon fluxes are calculated as a function of
   sediment fluxes, which depend principally upon drainage intensity,
   rainfall intensity, and basin slope. Although the drainage intensity is
   mainly related to the amount of precipitation and to mean temperature in
   the basin, slope is also retained as one of the controlling factors. Our
   empirical models result in a total organic carbon flux to the oceans of
   about 0.38 Gt per year globally. About 0.21 Gt carbon (Gt C) enter the
   oceans in dissolved form and about 0.17 Gt C in particulate form, We
   further regionalize fluxes with respect to major climates, different
   continents, and different ocean basins. About 45\% of the organic carbon
   is discharged from tropical wet regions. The major part of the dissolved
   organic carbon is discharged into the Atlantic Ocean, while the bulk of
   the particulate organic carbon is discharged into the Indian and Pacific
   Oceans.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of native prairies in the Lower Wisconsin River valley that
   have not been cropped affords a mean of comparison across undisturbed
   and managed ecosystems. A native prairie soil and a prairie converted to
   corn (Zea mays L.) and red pine (Pinus resinosa Aiton) plantations were
   studied to determine the influence of vegetation on soil-forming
   processes in the sandy landscape of the Lower Wisconsin River valley.
   Effects of afforestation and cultivation were determined by separating
   organic matter among particle-size and chemical fractions,
   differentiating among forms of extractable Fe and Al, and measuring
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Fe and Al in bulk precipitation,
   throughfall, and soil solutions at three depths. The soil under native
   prairie vegetation showed distinctive horizonation, including an umbric
   epipedon formed by melanization. Thickness of the A horizon was
   significantly less in the forested and cultivated soils than in the
   prairie soil. Greater amounts of the floatable fraction of organic C,
   fulvic acids, and Fe-organic complexes were present in the forested
   soils than in the prairie soil. Carbon concentration in the A horizon of
   the cultivated soil was significantly lower than in the prairie and
   forested soils, due to losses by erosion, decomposition, and DOC
   leaching. In the cultivated soil, the floatable and humin fractions
   showed the greatest decrease in C concentration compared with the
   prairie soil. Analysis of the solution data indicated leaching of
   soluble Pe-organic complexes under coniferous and corn vegetation,
   suggesting that afforestation and cultivation initiated incipient
   podzolization.}},

Abstract = {{The paper examines the relationships between soil aggregate stability,
   selected soil properties and land use in central Spain. Aggregate
   stability indices derived from three procedures were found to be
   significantly (p > 0.01) correlated with each other as well as with clay
   content, organic carbon and a range of water-soluble salts. Soils with a
   higher clay content have a lower aggregate stability. It appears that
   the presence of expandable clays has a major negative influence,
   although this impact is strongly modified by recent land-use history and
   contemporary land-management practices. Agricultural land, abandoned in
   the 1940s, was subsequently invaded by Cistus matorral or planted with
   Pinus. The most stable aggregates occur under matorral and may represent
   a lag of more resistant aggregates surviving past land-use-related
   erosional processes. Comparisons with aggregates under Pinus however
   suggest that hydrophobic substances from the Cistus may have increased
   aggregate stability. Aggregates from areas remaining in cultivation are
   the least resistant although the stability envelope overlaps with areas
   under Pinus. These differences may be related to cultivation practices
   whereby clay-rich subsurface horizons characterized by higher
   proportions of expandable clays are drawn to the surface, and to
   enhancement of aggregate stability under forest by fungal hyphae.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was carried out to evaluate the growth response of
   Pinus halepensis seedlings inoculated with Pisolithus arhizus and
   planted in a terraced rangeland amended with urban solid refuse. The
   application of the organic amendment mediated a significant increase in
   soil fertility and soil water content. Twenty seven months after
   planting seedling survival rates did not differ significantly among
   treatments and were above 95\% in all cases. Growth of I! halepensis was
   significantly (p<0.01) enhanced by the refuse application independently
   of their mycorrhizal status at the beginning of the experiment. A
   multiple regression analysis including available soil P concentration
   and sorptivity as independent variables explained up to 60\% of the
   variance in pine growth observed across treatments. Inoculation with Ii
   arhizus also significantly (p<0.01) enhanced pine growth with repect to
   the controls grown in both amended and nonamended plots. It was conduded
   that the combination of soil terracing, refuse amendment and I! arhizus
   inoculation significantly improved the performance of Pinus halepensis,
   and this methodology could be successfully applied in afforestation
   programmes in semiarid and degraded sites.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical properties and nutrient availability were measured in soil
   profiles of fire-prone, semiarid, Mediterranean-type shrublands in
   Sierra de Almijara (SE Spain). The area is steep and has a xeric
   moisture regime. In such conditions, soils developed on kakiritized
   (sugarlike microstructure) dolomitic marble have distinctive features
   such as a very coarse texture, extremely high carbonate content, and low
   nutrient availability. These soils support site-specific shrubland
   communities with many dolomitophile plant endemisms. During the last
   decades, the area has been subjected to a high fire frequency and
   intensive erosion, causing deforestation and soil degradation. To assess
   the problem, we chose a four-stage chronosequence representative of
   these changes, which included examples ranging from a long-unburned,
   dense, mature garigue stand, to an open, frequently burned,
   regenerating, gorse scrubland. The linear increase in the fire frequency
   along the chronosequence was associated to a sharp depletion of
   soil-available nutrients, namely, exchangeable cations, extractable
   mineral N, and especially NaHCO3-extractable inorganic P. The NH4+/NO3-
   ratio decreased through the sequence. Organic matter contents were
   >10\%, and total N concentrations were >4 mg N g(-1) in surface soils of
   the long-unburned garigue site, which contrasted with values of <4\% and
   1 mg N g(-1), respectively, in the most frequently burned, regenerating
   scrubland site. This decline of available nutrients is related to the
   slow recovery of the original garigue vegetation, or even substitution
   by other more degraded vegetation formations, that is observed in eroded
   sites, as well as with the lack of successful reforestation programs
   currently under way at the study site.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of coffee tree
   population density on soil fertility levels after fourteen years of a
   field experiment. A field trial was established in 1977 at Londrina,
   State of Parana, Brazil, with four commercial coffee cultivars (Catuai
   Amarelo, Acaia, Icatu and Mundo Novo) in the following population
   densities : 893, 1020, 1190, 1429, 1786, 2381, 3571 and 7143 holes / ha
   with 2 trees / hole. In 1991 soil samples were collected from 0 to 20 cm
   soil depth from each plot for chemical analysis. Increasing plant
   population per unity of area increased soil pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, and
   K, available P and organic carbon, and decreased exchangeable Al. These
   changes in soil fertility were greater under Catuai Amarelo than any
   other coffee cultivars. Increasing soil surface cover by tree canopy,
   decresing soil erosion, increasing residue management, decreasing
   nutrient depletion by leaching and improving nutrient cycling were found
   to be the possible mechanisms envolved in soil chemical improvement with
   increasing coffee tree population density.}},

Abstract = {{The soils of the mountains and plains of Central Asia can be grouped
   into three formations in relation to the total reserves and the ratio
   between organic and mineral carbonic compounds in them: (1)
   carbonate-carbonic, (2) organic-carbonate-carbonic, and (3) highly
   organic-carbonic. A wealth of pedogenic carbonates from topsoils of arid
   plain territories is involved in eolian migration due to the activity of
   deflation processes. Erosion and deflation of soils within subarid
   foothills and low mountains provide for eolian and water migration of
   pedo- and lithogenic carbonates as well as of humus-enriched fine earth.
   Erosion and cryogenic deflation of high mountain soils in humid regions
   attributes to the runoff of humus- and silica-enriched substances in
   mountain rivers. Sediments suspended in waters of mountain rivers and
   irrigation channels are deposited on plain in the form of modern
   alluvial and irrigation sediments that contain twice as much humus as
   background Gray-Brown and Takyr-like desert soils.}},

Abstract = {{About 65\% of New Zealand's economy is based on its natural and managed
   land systems and soils. Present understanding of their relative
   sensitivity to climate change is generally poor and largely qualitative.
   This paper examines the possible impacts of an enhanced greenhouse
   effect, with particular emphasis being given to identifying the most
   sensitive land systems and soils. A scenario of climate change, based on
   the IS92a emissions scenario of the IPCC, is used.
   The sensitivity of land systems is examined in two ways, Firstly, a
   first-order indication of how agroecosystems might respond to climate
   change is illustrated by assessing possible spatial changes in grain
   maize suitability. Secondly, susceptibility of land to erosion, with
   possible concomitant losses in productivity is assessed against changes
   in precipitation. The analysis suggested only small changes in erosion
   severity appear likely except in critical areas where a substantial
   increase could result from increases in storm frequency and intensity.
   In evaluating the sensitivity of soils, the emphasis is on soil organic
   matter. Soil organic matter, which stabilises topsoils and stores most
   of the nutrients, is critically important for the sustainability of land
   systems. Spatially referenced data for land use, soil carbon and climate
   are used in a model to indicate the possible responses of organic matter
   to climate change for the major ecosystems of New Zealand. Reductions in
   soil carbon of about 5-6\% per degree temperature increase were
   generally expected in the absence of effects from carbon dioxide
   fertilization and increased nutrient availability. Soils likely to reach
   critical minimum-threshold concentrations of organic matter over the
   next 60 years are identified.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion-productivity experiments were conducted in the Kilimanjaro,

   capacity (CEC), pH, total soil N (TSN), available P, available water
   capacity (AWC), and water saturation percentage. The magnitude of
   effects differed between soils and ecoregions. Maize grain yield was
   positively and significantly correlated with topsoil thickness, SOC,
   total N, CEC, and AWC. Maize grain yield declined at the rate of 38.5,
   55.0 and 87.7 kg per cm decrease in topsoil thickness in the

Abstract = {{In this study, the soils on the steeplands of Sabacan, Himaya, and San
   Jose, and on the uplands and alluvial areas of Musuan, were mapped,
   characterized morphologically and chemically, and classified based on
   the USDA Soil Taxonomy, The mineralogy of the various soil horizons has
   been determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   The soils in the steepland and upland areas are classified as Typic
   Hapludalfs and Lithic Dystropepts, The floodplain is occupied by Typic
   Tropaquepts, The pH of the Ap horizons is moderately acid in Typic
   Hapludalfs and Typic Dystropepts and strongly acid in Typic Tropaquepts,
   The apparent cation exchange capacity is very high in these soils,
   characterized by low contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen, a
   very low available phosphorus and low base status.
   XRD analysis showed that gibbsite, quartz, halloysite and hydroxy
   interlayered 2:1 minerals are present in the clay fraction of all soils,
   TEM showed goethite as acicular crystals extending into pores like
   needles and lepidocrocite as highly elongated flakes found abundant in
   the sub-soils of Typic Tropaquepts.
   Typic Hapludalfs are deep, well-drained soils suitable for upland
   cultivation, Use of light implements would help minimize soil compaction
   during land preparation, and contour plowing would alleviate soil
   erosion hazards on these soils, The coarse-textured Lithic Dystropepts,
   which have a coherent underlying hard rock material at 50 cm of the
   mineral surface, would require proper drainage, A clayey texture and a
   massive structure with redoximorphic conditions pose aeration problems
   in the Typic Tropaquepts, These soils could best be utilized for lowland
   rice cultivation.}},

Year = {{1996}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of crop residues to protect the soil surface and
   reduce soil erosion decreases as residues decompose. The rate of residue
   decomposition is directly related to the temperature and moisture
   regimes of the residues. Predicting changes in residue mass,
   orientation, and soil cover requires the use of functions that relate
   changes in decomposition rates to changes in the temperature and water
   regimes. Temperature and water functions used in the residue
   decomposition submodel of the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) were
   evaluated for their effects on predictions of residue decomposition. A
   precipitation function (PC) was found to produce relatively more
   accurate estimates of decomposition than a near surface soil water
   content function (SWC) for describing water regime effects. The
   estimated accuracies of the two functions were similar when bias in the
   estimation was considered. Predictions made with PC had estimated
   accuracies of +/-11.4, 14.5, 13.5\% for alfalfa, sorghum and wheat,
   respectively, while those made with SWC had estimated accuracies of
   +/-13.8, 16.2, and 16.9\%, respectively. Three temperature functions
   were compared for use in predicting residue decomposition over a range
   of locations and crops. There was little difference between the
   temperature functions over all the locations but, for several locations,
   one function overpredicted decomposition more often than the other two
   functions. Accuracies ranged from +/-4 to +/-51\% of the observed
   values. The highest values were obtained at one location, and all three
   temperature functions produced similar high values. Over most of the
   data, estimated accuracies were generally between +/-15 and +/-25\%. The
   prediction intervals were similar to those observed for decomposition of
   surface-placed residues. This evaluation indicates that the temperature
   and water functions used in the WEPS decomposition submodel will give
   seasonable estimates of mass loss from surface residues using
   easy-to-obtain weather data.}},

Abstract = {{A characterization of eroded soil properties, especially size, is
   required for proper usage of modern process-based soil erosion models.
   In a study addressing reclaimed mine land erodibility, over 350 measured
   eroded aggregate size distributions were collected from erosion plots
   created on reclaimed and nearby unmined soils at three separate strip
   mine sites. The experimental design allowed for a comparison of eroded
   aggregate size distributions as a function of land slope, run sequence,
   and reclamation treatment. No influence of slope was apparent, as
   distributions collected from plots constructed at 6\% slope were coarser
   than those collected from 18\% slope, but finer than those collected
   from 12\%. Samples collected during extra inflow runs, in which runoff
   rates, flow velocity, and rill erosion were greatest, had coarser
   distributions than samples collected during rainfall only runs, which
   tended to have similar distributions. Distributions from reclaimed
   topsoil treatments were similar to nearby unmined soils and were
   distinct from subsoil reclamation treatments. At two sires, topsoil
   treatments had coarser distributions, while the converse was true at the
   third.
   Distributions taken from topsoil and unmined soil treatments were used
   to develop five regression equations to predict the percentage of total
   eroded soil mass falling into each of five size classes-clay, silt, and
   three sand sizes. A stepwise, multivariate regression technique was used
   to select the best independent variables from 30 soil parameters.
   Independent variables that proved to be significant in at least one
   equation include primary particle and water stable aggregate size
   distributions, bulk density, organic carbon, and soil moisture. The
   number of significant independent variables ranges from II to 15 and
   correlation coefficients (R(2)) range from 0.77 to 0.53, which is a
   general improvement over previously published prediction methods.}},

Abstract = {{Raised wide beds have been proposed as a conservation tillage practice
   for reducing erosion losses in vertisols, but few measurements of
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses have been reported. The objective
   of this study was to examine the impact of tillage systems and
   fertilizer N application methods on sediment and nutrient losses
   associated with interrill runoff. Simulated rainfall events (125 mm
   h(-1) until 30 min of runoff had occurred) were applied to raised wide
   beds (0.15 m high and 1.5 m wide with 0.5-m-wide furrows) on a Houston
   Black clay (fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellusterts) which had
   been managed with either a no-till or a chisel-till tillage system.
   Three simulated methods of applying fertilizer N (surface band,
   coulter-nozzle, or spoke wheel simulated field practices) were compared
   in a split plot experimental design with four replications. Total N and
   P losses, as well as fertilizer N losses, in both sediment and solution
   from interrill runoff were determined from 1 m(2) plots. While no P was
   applied in fertilizer, greater P losses were observed with the
   chisel-till compared to no-till. While N losses in runoff were
   relatively low, fertilizer N application with surface banding or the
   coulter-nozzle applicator in no-till had greater total N and fertilizer
   N losses. Under relatively wet soil water conditions, respective losses
   of total inorganic N and fertilizer N in solution were greater from
   no-till with 4.0 and 2.0 kg N ha(-1) lost, as compared to 0.2 and 0.1 kg
   N ha(-1) lost from chisel-till per rainfall event. Losses of N in
   sediment were greatest in chisel-till, with 2.1 and 0.03 kg N ha(-1)
   lost from chisel-till, as compared to 0.6 and 0.01 kg N ha(-1) lost from
   no-till, of total N and fertilizer N per rainfall event, respectively
   The greatest N losses during the runoff event was observed with the
   surface banded and coulter-nozzle fertilizer application methods in
   no-till due to increased fertilizer N losses.}},

Abstract = {{Land use activities, particularly related to agriculture and forestry
   can have considerable impact on the biological health of soils. In the
   UK some soils are poor in soil organic matter and it has been suggested
   that these soils are vulnerable to inappropriate farming activities.
   Existing monitoring of soil biological health appears limited and poorly
   co-ordinated. To address this problem the agro-ecosystem is conceived as
   a three dimensional structure in which the distribution of carbon plays
   a central role. Issues associated with the construction of a monitoring
   framework to provide policy relevant information on soil biological
   health are discussed and examples of techniques which may usefully be
   incorporated in such a framework are presented. In conclusion an action
   plan for monitoring soil biological health is proposed which includes
   the integration of experimental, modelling and Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) techniques so that information can be provided at both a
   national and local scale.}},

   Mg ha(-1) for the F, PN, DP and R treatments, respectively. In
   comparison with DP, PN decreased annual runoff by 40.3 per cent and
   annual soil loss by 79.5 per cent. The high mean soil loss for the R
   treatment was due to erosion following soil removal. An additional 2920
   Mg ha(-1) of surface soil was removed from the R treatment in May 1990.
   The F treatment reduced runoff by 78, 77 and 62 per cent and reduced
   soil loss by 99.7, 99.4 and 98.4 per cent compared with the R, DP and PN
   treatments, respectively. Mean losses of K, Ca, Mg and P were 1.3, 4, 1
   and 0.1 kg ha(-1), respectively for F, 3, 16, 5 and 0.3 kg ha(-1),
   respectively, for PN, 5, 31, 1 and 0.6 kg ha(-1), respectively, for DP,
   and 3, 32, 12 and 0.4 kg ha(-1), respectively, for R. Soil and nutrient
   losses for each treatment were in the order R > DP > PN > F. The soil
   organic carbon (SOC) content was significantly affected by soil erosion
   and management treatments, and ranged from 0.98 per cent for the R
   treatment to 2.3 per cent for the F treatment. Soil surface removal for
   the R treatment in 1990 reduced water-stable aggregates (WSA) by 9.0 per
   cent, SOC by 0.6 per cent, and clay content of the uppermost 0-50 mm
   depth by about 7.0 per cent. Mean total porosity (f(t)) ranged from 0.43
   for the F to 0.52 for the DP treatment. Cumulative infiltration for 3 h
   ranged from 13 cm for R to 34 cm for PN, with corresponding infiltration
   rates of 4cm h(-1) and 13 cm h(-1), respectively. Regardless of the
   treatment, there were also temporal changes in soil properties. In
   comparison with 1988, measurements made in 1990 showed a significant
   decrease in WSA of 21.3 per cent, an increase in clay content of 2.8 per
   cent, and a decrease in SOC of 0.39 per cent. Runoff and soil losses
   were significantly correlated with the mean weight diameter (MWD), SOC,
   bulk density (rho(b)) and available water capacity (AWC). Plant height
   measured 8 weeks after planting (WAP) for the R treatment was reduced by
   33.3 per cent, 33.0 per cent and 29.0 per cent compared withh DP, PN and
   F, respectively. Nitrogen uptake by maize plants (Zea mays L.) 10 WAP
   for the R treatment was lower by 15 per cent, 8 per cent, and 6 per cent
   compared with the DP, PN and F treatments, respectively, while P uptake
   was lower by 33 per cent, 32 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively,
   compared with the same treatments. Grain yield was 9.78 Mg ha(-1) for
   PN, 9.76 Mg ha(-1) for DP, 8.64 Mg ha(-1) for F and 6.60 Mg ha(-1) for R
   during the 1990 crop season. Grain yield was reduced by about 32.4 per
   cent in the R treatment compared with the PN treatment, representing a
   maize grain yield reduction of 158 kg ha(-1) for each centimeter of soil
   lost.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted during summer, 1992, in a protected bay of
   the La Grande-2 reservoir (northern Quebec) to evaluate the role of
   erosional processes in the transfer of mercury from a flooded soil to
   the water column. Up to 57\% of the organic carbon, approximately 4\% of
   the inorganic mercury, and nearly 71\% of the methylmercury from the
   humic horizon of a flooded podzol were transferred to the water column
   and transported outside the experimental perimeter in the form of
   particulate matter after one resuspension event. In contrast, total
   dissolved mercury concentrations in the water column decreased during
   the resuspension event as a result of scavenging by suspended particles.
   We postulate that most of the methylmercury produced in the submerged
   soils is associated with fine-grained organic particles that remain in
   suspension for some time before flocculating and accumulating at the
   sediment-water interface. We suspect that these particles are a
   potential food source and can be readily ingested by pelagic and benthic
   detritus-feeders as well as trapped by periphyton. Resuspension and
   erosion processes along the exposed shores of a recently impounded
   reservoir may thus accelerate the transfer of mercury, primarily as
   methylmercury, from flooded soils to predatory fish.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of management-induced changes in soil organic matter depend
   on the methods used to calculate the quantities of organic C and N
   stored in soils. Chemical analyses in the laboratory indicate the
   concentrations of elements in soils, but the thickness and bulk density
   of the soil layers in the field must be considered to estimate the
   quantities of elements per unit area. Conventional methods that
   calculate organic matter storage as the product of concentration, bulk
   density and thickness do not fully account for variations in soil mass.
   Comparisons between the quantities of organic C, N, P and S in Gray
   Luvisol soils under native aspen forest and various cropping systems
   were hampered by differences in the mass of soil under consideration.
   The influence of these differences was eliminated by calculating the
   masses of C, N, P and S in an `'equivalent soil mass'' (i.e. the mass of
   soil in a standard or reference surface layer). Reassessment of
   previously published data also indicated that estimates of organic
   matter storage depended on soil mass. Appraisals of organic matter
   depletion or accumulation usually were different for comparisons among
   element masses in an equivalent soil mass than for comparisons among
   element masses in genetic horizons or in fixed sampling depths. Unless
   soil erosion or deposition had altered the mass of topsoil per unit
   area, comparisons among unequal soil masses were unjustified and
   erroneous. For management-induced changes in soil organic matter and
   nutrient storage to be assessed reliably, the masses of soil being
   compared must be equivalent.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of management practices on erosion and crop productivity for
   different agro-ecosystems in Canada are largely unknown. A study was
   conducted to examine the effects of management on soil loss and wheat

   erosion was measured using the Cs-137 technique. Under conventional
   tillage, topsoil was lost at a rate of 2-37 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Equivalent
   loss in topsoil thickness ranged between 0.02 and 0.28 cm yr(-1). Soil
   losses were highest in 2-yr wheat-fallow crop rotations. Continuous
   wheat, 5-yr cereal-hay rotations, and plots amended with manure reduced
   soil losses and maintained thicker topsoils. At Ellerslie, Alberta,
   there was no measurable soil loss from a Black Chemozemic cropped to
   continuous barley under zero tillage. Decrease in annual wheat yield
   averaged 106 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) topsoil loss in the Brown Chernozemic and
   117 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) topsoil loss in the Gray Luvisol.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated erosion can have adverse effects on soil properties and crop
   yield. Therefore, an on-farm evaluation of the effects of past soil
   erosion on productivity was done for a Miamian soil (fine, mixed, mesic
   Typic Hapludalfs) in central Ohio in 1991. Three levels of soil erosion
   identified by a field survey and topsoil depth included slight (20-25 cm
   topsoil depth), moderate (15-20 cm) and severe erosion (10-15 cm).
   Soybean yield and soil properties under these conditions were compared
   with those for uneroded soil (wooded conditions with topsoil of 25-30 cm
   depth) and for deposition sites (30-35 cm depth). Soil properties
   measured included bulk density, particle density, organic carbon
   contents, infiltration capacity, and moisture retention at different
   suctions. Bulk density of 0 to 10 cm depth was significantly low in
   uneroded control (1.20 Mg/m(3)). High bulk density of 1.45 to 1.49
   Mg/m(3) was observed in moderately and severely eroded phases. The
   moisture retention at 0.03 MPa (0.47 V/V) was the highest in uneroded
   control. The highest available water capacity of the 0 to 10 cm layer
   (0.16 to 0.17 V/V) was observed for wooded control and slight erosion
   phase. Total aggregation was also the least on slightly eroded phase.
   Soil organic carbon content did not differ among three erosional phases
   with a 0 to 10 cm depth mean value of 1.03\% compared with 1.83\% for
   deposition and 2.93\% for wooded soils. Similar trends were observed for
   the 10 to 20 cm depth. Concentrations of exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg and
   total CEC increased with increasing degree of erosion for both depths.
   There were no differences in CEC of the 0 to 10 cm depth for severely
   eroded and wooded soils. The rainfall received during 1991 was below
   normal. There were no differences in soybean yield among slight,
   moderate and severely eroded phases. Because of severe crusting and
   drought stress, crop stand was poor on slightly eroded plateau soils.
   Adverse soil physical conditions, low soil organic carbon content,
   severe crusting, and drought were likely responsible factors for low
   yields on slightly eroded plateau soils. Soybean grain yield was 1.5
   Mg/ha for slight erosion, 1.4 Mg/ha for moderate erosion, 1.6 Mg/ha for
   severe erosion, and 3.1 Mg/ha for deposition}},

Abstract = {{Soils of northeastern Nigeria (subject to wind erosion) were studied for
   erodibility. Samples of the surface soil were analyzed to determine the
   percentages of sand, silt, clay, organic carbon, and calcium carbonate
   and the aggregate stability and size distribution. The intrinsic and
   dynamic soil properties contributed to the erodibility of the soils. The
   sandy northern part of the study area had higher percentages of fine
   sand and lower percentages of silt, clay, and organic carbon, quite
   variable amounts of calcium carbonate, and lower aggregate stability and
   size distribution in comparison with the southern half of the study
   area. Soils in the south were more stable, with larger nonerodible size
   distribution and 50\% less wind-erodible fraction than the north. The
   computed soil-erodible fraction from soil properties was highly
   correlated (r = 0.89, p < 0.01) with the measured erodible fraction.
   This implies that soil erodibility can be computed from the soil's
   physical and chemical properties for northeastern Nigeria when a
   standard compact rotary sieve is not available.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of soil organic C after a change in cropping practice are
   important in defining the potential impact of the new practice on soil
   behavior and net CO2 exchange. Our objective was to determine the
   duration and magnitude of a shift in soil organic C after a change in
   summer fallow frequency in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) systems.
   Total organic and light-fraction C in continuous wheat (W),
   fallow-wheat-wheat (FWW), and fallow-wheat (FW) treatments were
   determined in soil samples collected periodically from 1954 to 1992 from
   a long-term spring wheat study located in the northern Great Plains.
   Organic C concentrations in the 0- to 15-cm depth were 11\% lower in the
   FW and FWW treatments than in the W treatment from 1967 to 1992. Organic
   C concentrations in the 15- to 30-cm depth were not affected by
   treatment, but varied among sampling years due to differences in
   effective sampling depth. Light-fraction C concentrations were 38\%
   lower in the FW and FWW treatments than in the W treatment from 1967 to
   1992. Reduced light-fraction C accounted for about one-third of the
   decrease in total organic C due to inclusion of fallow in the crop
   rotation. The negative influence of fallow was primarily due to enhanced
   decomposition in the fallow year. We conclude that most losses of soil
   organic C due to introduction of a falloff system occur within two
   decades, and that further loss of organic C is negligible provided soil
   erosion is minimal.}},

Abstract = {{Four plots from a mixed conifer forest were similarly cleared, burned,
   and replanted at various times over 17 years; a plot logged 79 years
   before sampling was used as a control. The plots had similar slope (2 to
   15\%, midslope position), aspect (south to southeast), and soil type
   (Holland series: mesic Haploxeralf; a Gray Brown Luvisol in the Canadian
   classification system). Twenty sites at each plot were sampled
   volumetrically by horizon to 20 cm below the organic - mineral soil
   boundary. Samples were analyzed for bulk density, organic C, and total
   N. There was an initial loss (15\%) of organic C from the soil within 1
   to 7 years, likely the result of oxidation (burning and decomposition)
   and erosion. For 17 years of forest regrowth, the soil continued to lose
   C (another 15\%), probably owing to decomposition of slash material and
   possibly erosion, despite the slight accumulation of new litter and
   roots. After 80 years of regrowth, rates of carbon accumulation exceeded
   fates of loss, but carbon storage had declined and was not likely to
   recover to preharvest levels. Timber harvest and site preparation
   dramatically altered soil C and N distribution, in which C/N ratios
   after site preparation were initially high throughout the upper 20 cm.
   Subsequently, C/N ratios became lower with depth and with recovery age.
   Although stocks of C and N varied considerably among the plots and did
   not change consistently as a function of recovery age, the C/N ratios
   did vary systematically with recovery age. We hypothesize that the
   amount of C ultimately stored in the soil at steady state depends
   largely on N reserves and potentials, which appear to vary with erosion,
   intensity of burning, and site treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining soil stability and normal water and nutrient cycles in
   desert systems is critical to avoiding desertification. These particular
   ecosystem processes are threatened by trampling of livestock and people,
   and by off-road vehicle use. Soil compaction and disruption of
   cryptobiotic soil surfaces (composed of cyanobacteria, lichens, and
   mosses) can result in decreased water availability to vascular plants
   through decreased water infiltration and increased albedo with possible
   decreased precipitation. Surface disturbance may also cause accelerated
   soil loss through wind and water erosion and decreased diversity and
   abundance of soil biota. In addition, nutrient cycles can be altered
   through lowered nitrogen and carbon inputs and slowed decomposition of
   soil organic matter, resulting in lower nutrient levels in associated
   vascular plants. Some cold desert systems may be especially susceptible
   to these disruptions due to the paucity of surface-rooting vascular
   plants for soil stabilization, fewer nitrogen-fixing higher plants, and
   lower soil temperatures, which slow nutrient cycles. Desert soils may
   recover slowly from surface disturbances, resulting in increased
   vulnerability to desertification. Recovery from compaction and decreased
   soil stability is estimated to take several hundred years.
   Re-establishment rates for soil bacterial and fungal populations are not
   known. The nitrogen fixation capability of soil requires at least 50
   years to recover. Recovery of crusts can be hampered by large amounts of
   moving sediment, and re-establishment can be extremely difficult in some
   areas. Given the sensitivity of these resources and slow recovery times,
   desertification threatens million of hectares of semiarid lands in the
   United States.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence of Late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironmental change in
   the northern hinterland of the KwaZulu-Natal province, eastern South
   Africa, is preserved within a widespread sequence of colluvium and
   intercalated palaeosols, comprising the Masotcheni Formation. Palaeosol
   profile characteristics and micromorphological features are described
   for the full stratigraphic succession, preserved at the St Paul's donga
   reference site and other comparative exposures, permitting the
   interpretation of pedogenic processes active on hillslopes during the
   polycyclic accretion of colluvial sediments blanketing many hillslopes
   in the region. The importance of soil erosion and the transport of
   pre-weathered sediment and pedorelict aggregates is highlighted. The
   `eluilluviation' particle translocation process, commonly synchronous
   with periodic Fe mobilization and reprecipitation,was active at
   differing intensities in all of the palaeosols studied. The
   palaeoclimatic implications of the aforementioned processes during the
   past similar to 120 ka are placed in chronological context using a
   series of radiocarbon dates from palaeosol organic matter and soil
   carbonates and infra red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating of the
   parent colluvium. The dating framework permits generalized
   interpretation of the periodicity of erosional and colluvial events as
   well as the period of existence of palaeosol landsurfaces, which is of
   relevance when interpreting the age of similar soils on the current
   landsurface.}},

Abstract = {{Fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems may be responsible
   for declines in soil organic matter and degradation of soil physical
   properties. A change to annual cropping may improve or at least maintain
   soil properties. Tillage and crop sequence effects on soil properties
   and water infiltration were tested after 9 yr of cropping on a Dooley
   sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiborolls) derived in glacial
   till. Annual cropping tillage of fall sweep and spring disk (AWFST), and
   no tillage (AWNT) were compared with conventional tillage in
   wheat-fallow (FWCT) as the control. Statistical design was a randomized
   complete block with four replications, Soil samples were taken at 0.03-m
   increments to a depth of 0.3 m and were used to measure organic carbon
   (OC), pH, bulk density (BD), and particle size. Point resistance was
   measured in 0.02-m increments, Water infiltration into dry and wet soil
   was measured using a rainfall simulator, Maximum soil BD was 1.61 Mg
   m(-3) on FWCT and 1.56 Mg m(-3) on AWNT. Soil BD was not changed by one
   winter of freezing and thawing. Maximum point resistance was 2.2 MPa on
   FWCT and 1.7 MPa on AWNT. Cumulative 3-h infiltration into dry soil was
   52 mm for FWCT and 69 mm for AWNT. Final infiltration rate into wet soil
   was 5 mm h(-1) for FWCT and 6 mm h(-1) for AWNT. There was a significant
   difference in the depth distribution of OC between annual crop and FWCT
   treatments. Mass of OC in the top 0.09 m of soil was 1.65 kg m(-2) on
   annual crop treatments and 1.45 kg m(-2) on FWCT, Greater amounts of OC
   on the annual crop treatments compared with the FWCT attest to the
   beneficial aspect of annual cropping in maintaining a level of soil
   quality that is greater than FWCT. From a soil conservation perspective,
   no-tillage has an additional advantage because surface cover is
   maintained throughout the year, thereby reducing the potential for soil
   erosion.}},

Abstract = {{In the Sierra de Carrascoy (Murcia, southeastern Spain), ilimerized
   soils appear locally with different characteristics from those of the
   dominant soils. These ilimerized soils are relicts of more stable
   geomorphological surfaces. Four representative profiles were studied for
   evaluating their pedogenetic processes and to classify them
   typologically, Analytical determinations were made of organic carbon,
   total nitrogen, calcium carbonate equivalent, pH, cation exchange
   capacity, electrical conductivity, and particle size. Determinations
   were made of free iron oxide extracted with sodic hydrosulfite, and
   total iron, silicon, and aluminum oxides, The profiles are of a A-Bt-Ck
   or A-Bt-R type with a pronounced reddish color (2,5YR or 5YR). The soils
   have art average organic matter content of 19.6-44.5 g kg(-1) in the
   surface horizons and, in general, are totally decarbonated. The cation
   exchange capacity is highest in the argillic horizons (16.9-25.0 cmol(c)
   kg(-1)), and their electrical conductivity is generally low. They have a
   Bt horizon (40.2-62.8\% clay), a relict of an ancient pedogenesis where
   cutans, retraction cracks, and slickensides are visible, The ratio of
   free Fe2O3 to total Fe2O3 is highest in these argilluviation horizons,
   These soils indicate that different climatological conditions existed in
   the past, which made decarbonatization, rubefaction, and argilluviation
   possible. More recent processes of erosion and/or accumulation and
   recarbonatization have acted on these paleosols (classified as Xerollic
   Paleargids and Calcic Rhodoxeralfs).}},

Abstract = {{Soil-surface seals and crusts resulting from aggregate breakdown reduce
   the soil infiltration rate and may induce erosion by increasing runoff.
   The cultivated loess areas of northwestern Europe are particularly prone
   to these processes.
   Surface samples of ten tilled silty loamy loess soils, ranging in clay
   content from 120 to 350 g kg(-1) and in organic carbon from 10 to 20 g
   kg-1, were packed into 0.5 m(2) plots with 5\% slopes and subjected to
   simulated rainfall applied at 30 mm h(-1). The 120 minutes rainfall
   events were applied to initially field-moist soil, air-dried soil and
   rewetted soil to investigate the effect of soil moisture content prior
   to rainfall. Runoff and eroded sediments were collected at 5 minutes
   intervals. Aggregate stability of the soils was assessed by measuring
   particle-size distribution after different treatments.
   All soils formed seals. Runoff rates were between 70 and 90\% by the end
   of the rainfall event for field-moist plots. There were large
   differences between soil runoff rates for the air-dried and rewetted
   plots. Interrill erosion was associated with runoff, and sediment
   concentration in runoff readily reached a steady-state value.
   Measurements of aggregate stability for various treatments were in good
   agreement with sealing, runoff and erosion responses to rainfall. Runoff
   and erosion were lower for air-dried plots than for field-moist plots,
   and were either intermediate or lowest for rewetted plots, depending on
   soil characteristics. Soils with a high clay content had the lowest
   erosion rate when they were rewetted, whereas the soil with a high
   organic-carbon content had the lowest erosion rate in air-dry
   conditions. The results indicate the complexity of the effect of initial
   moisture content, and the interactions between soil properties and
   climate.}},

   APPROACH TO QUANTIFYING CHEMICAL-WEATHERING}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces digital processing of back-scattered electron
   (BSE) imagery as a microscopic approach to measure porosity from in situ
   dissolution of minerals. Four case studies exemplify this technique.
   Cases 1 and 2 explore the initiation and maintenance of weathering
   forms. In case 1, alveoli start in the Sedona area of Arizona when
   sandstone porosity exceeds approximately 32\%. This threshold is
   probably the point at which intergrain cohesion is reduced enough for
   shear stresses to erode grains. Case 2 examines the maintenance of
   gnamma pits and polygonal cracks on a basalt boulder on the island of
   Maui, Hawaii. Rock dissolution progresses while the surface of the rock
   is preserved under coatings of silica glaze. When a porosity of
   approximately 37\%-47\% is reached, the weathering rind losses cohesion
   and spalls. Then, the protective silica glaze starts to accrete again,
   and another cycle begins.
   Cases 3 and 4 involve measuring rates of dissolution over thousands of
   years. Case 3 concerns rock dissolution in weathering rinds formed on
   ventifacted aplite boulders. Weathering rinds lost mass for the last 14
   k.y. at a rate of 40 +/- 15 g/m2/k.y., and for the last 17 k.y. at a
   rate of 43 +/- 16 g/m2/k.y. Dissolution rates increased over time to 67
   +/- 23 g/m2/k.y. for the last 60-65 k.y. Case 4 addresses the classic
   topic of which variable is most important in chemical weathering:
   temperature, precipitation, or microenvironment. In situ measurements of
   plagioclase dissolution in approximately 3-k.y.-old basalt flows reveal
   that warmer temperatures enhance rates of plagioclase dissolution by
   about 0.07\%/degrees-C, when precipitation and microenvironment are
   controlled. Plagioclase dissolution increases as precipitation increases
   at higher elevations, even though temperature decreases. However,
   microenvironment is a more important control on plagioclase dissolution;
   organic-rich positions (under lichens) weather two to seven times faster
   than adjacent organic-poor positions away from epilithic organisms and
   rock coatings.
   Rates of rock weathering are often established indirectly, by measuring
   the erosion of weathered material. In contrast, this microscopic method
   measures only in situ weathering. Conventional measures of rock
   weathering usually involve units, for example, depth of weathering pits
   or thickness of weathering rinds, that are not readily comparable to
   other data. In contrast, cases 3 and 4 illustrate that in situ
   measurements of rock and mineral porosity can yield data on mass
   weathered per unit area over time. This information is comparable to
   mass balance approaches in watershed- and soil-based weathering
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Shelterbelt planting is often recommended as a means to reduce wind
   erosion. Six sheltered and three unsheltered fields representing
   moderately coarse to moderately fine textured soils were sampled along
   transects to determine the effects of the belts on soil wind erosion and
   soil properties. Cs-137 measurements indicated that shelterbelts about 6
   m tall and 200 m apart considerably reduced off-field soil losses from
   moderately coarse and medium textured soils. Off-field soil losses from
   unsheltered moderately fine textured soils were low and similar to those
   from sheltered fields. Shelterbelts did not prevent in-field
   redistribution, and soil deposition was evident out from the
   shelterbelts for about 20 m. Organic C and 15-bar water content were
   increased, and bulk density decreased, in a strip about 10 m wide
   adjacent to the belts. Increased biomass production from the shelterbelt
   and its grass edge are probably the main cause for the increased organic
   C content. Decreased bulk electrical conductivity indicated increased
   leaching out to about 15 m from the belt. Leaching has also decreased
   the pH of the surface soil but has not affected the depth to carbonates.}},

Abstract = {{Information on spatial distribution of soil properties in a landscape is
   not only required for soil mapping and classification but also for soil
   management. Spatial patterns of soil properties in a landscape are the
   results of systematic variations in pedogenic processes controlled by
   environmental factors of which landscape position is important. In
   northeast Brazil, Lithosols (Ustorthents) whose surface horizons are
   directly underlain by lithic or paralithic contacts occupy upper slope
   positions with steep gradient; the Cambisols (Ustropepts) occupy the
   mid- and lower slope positions. In some cases Non-Calcic Brown
   soils/Planosol (Haplustalfs) occupy lower slopes. We examined the
   properties of two contiguous hillslopes in granitic and gneissic
   saprolite to determine whether there were any systematic variations
   among landscape positions and to interpret pedogenesis in the
   hillslopes. Particle size distribution, and the Ti content of sand plus
   silt and saprolite showed that the two hillslopes were formed on
   different parent materials. At Site 1, soil property variations along
   the slope, measured by standard deviation from the means, were
   attributed to variability in parent material rather than to landscape
   position. Except for solum thickness, which increased systematically
   downslope, variations in sand, clay, ECEC and pH were not related to
   landscape position. Increasing solum thickness downslope was explained
   by the effect of erosion on the upper, and deposition at the lower
   slopes. Silt and organic carbon contents at Site 1, and Fe-o and Fe-d
   contents at Site 2 significantly decreased downslope. One possible
   explanation for this trend, in addition to erosion and deposition, is
   the effect of slash and burn agriculture on the lower slopes, and the
   changes in redox conditions caused by periodic waterlogging.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a fully automatic image analysis system capable of measuring
   cell numbers, volumes, lengths, and widths of bacteria in soil smears,
   The system also determines the number of cells in agglomerates and thus
   provides the frequency of dividing cells (FDC). Images are acquired from
   a confocal laser scanning microscope. The grey images are smoothed by
   convolution and by morphological erosion and dilation to remove noise.
   The background is equalized by flooding holes in the image and is then
   subtracted by two top hat transforms, Finally, the grey image is
   sharpened by delineation, and all particles above a fixed threshold are
   detected. The number of cells in each detected particle is determined by
   counting the number of local grey-level maxima in the particle, Thus, up
   to 1,500 cells in 10 fields of view in a soil smear are analyzed in 30
   min without human intervention, Automatic counts of cell numbers and FDC
   were similar to visual counts in field samples, In microcosms, automatic
   measurements showed significant increases in cell numbers, FDC, mean
   cell volume, and length-to-width ratio after amendment of the soil,
   Volumes of fluorescent microspheres were measured with good
   approximation, but the absolute values obtained were strongly affected
   by the settings of the detector sensitivity. Independent measurements of
   bacterial cell numbers and volumes by image analysis and of cell carbon
   by a total organic carbon analyzer yielded an average specific carbon
   content of 200 fg of C mu m(-3), which indicates that our volume
   estimates are reasonable.}},

Abstract = {{Legislation requiring the rehabilitation of new opencast coal mines came
   into effect in New South Wales, Australia, in 1973.  Mining companies
   now stockpile original topsoil which is later spread with fertilizer
   over re-shaped overburden and waste carbonaceous material.  Problems in
   successfully revegetating new surfaces are exacerbated by the thinness
   and infertility of natural soils, which are deficient in phosphorus and
   moderately acid.  Revegetation has not been successful on untreated mine
   waste and overburden.  This study provides a general overview of some
   aspects of post-rehabilitation soil chemistry and vegetation on these
   soils.  A limited number of samples, collected from three mine sites
   having different rainfall and varying ages of rehabilitated areas, were
   tested for pH, EC, organic carbon, total phosphorus and available
   aluminium.  Rehabilitated areas were all characterised by very low
   levels of total phosphorus, neutral pH, and variable and relatively low
   organic carbon, and some showed aluminium toxicity.  Heavy application
   of gypsum at one of the steeper sites was associated with acid pH, high
   EC values, low total P, Al toxicity, some soil erosion and little plant
   cover.  Except for this site, the variable vegetation cover at the sites
   studied seemed adequate for long-term re-establishment, despite serious
   weed invasion at some non-studied sites, soil loss on newly re-formed
   surfaces, and generally poor natural and rehabilitated soils.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the effect of long-term
   cultivation on clay dispersibility of four aggregate size fractions
   (2.0-9.5 mm, 0.85-2.0 mm, 0.25-0.85 mm, and <0.25 mm) obtained from a
   Chernozemic soil by comparing two cultivated sites with an adjacent
   native prairie site. Aggregate size fractions (ASF) were subjected to
   increasing levels of ultrasonic energy and the amount of clay dispersed
   at each energy level was determined. Organic carbon, hexose carbon,
   soluble hexose C, total clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and
   exchangeable cations were measured for each ASF. Clay contained within
   prairie aggregates was held much more strongly within the aggregate and
   therefore showed greater stability towards dispersion by ultrasonic
   vibration. More energy was required to disperse one-half of the ASF clay
   under prairie than under cultivated soils (228-425, and 95-229 kl L(-1)
   for prairie and cultivated macroaggregates, respectively; 370-433, and
   249-334 kj L(-1) for prairie and cultivated microaggregates,
   respectively). Clay dispersibility was significantly correlated with
   organic C, hexose C, soluble hexose C, non-hexose C, CEC, and
   exchangeable Ca and Mg but was not correlated with total ASF clay.
   Long-term cultivation of this soil resulted in a decrease in the energy
   required to disperse an equivalent proportion of clay from aggregates
   relative to that of the grassland soil. Thus, cultivation of these soils
   has resulted in aggregates which are more susceptible to clay dispersion
   and therefore prone to water erosion and surface crusting.}},

Abstract = {{To interpret climatic signatures from magnetic susceptibility (MS) in
   the Barton County loess-soil sequence, central Kansas, we tested the
   influence of particle size and carbonate concentration on magnetic
   susceptibility. First, sand, silt and clay were separated and MS was
   then measured on each of the three size fractions. To assess the
   influence of chemical treatments and carbonate on MS signals, the
   chemical agents used to remove carbonate, organic matter and free iron
   oxides were applied to another set of samples and MS was measured before
   and after each of the treatments. The results show that the bulk MS
   differentiates among stratigraphic units, but the environmental
   interpretation is far from straightforward. Soils have stronger MS
   signals than the loess units in the upper portion, while the
   carbonate-rich soils have weaker MS signals in the lower portion due to
   the MS dilution effect of carbonate. Sand MS peaks in Bignell Loess,
   Peoria loess and LL1 may suggest that in loess units fewer sand-sized
   magnetic minerals were changed by weathering processes into clay-sized
   magnetic minerals than in soils. A low bulk MS at the bottom of the
   reddish pedocomplex to the bottom of LS1 is attributable to a
   combination of a high sand content and a high carbonate concentration.
   The silt MS peak in the Barton sand might have been derived from the
   parent materials. Comparing with mineralogic and chemical indices, clay
   MS might be closer to being a proxy of weathering intensity. Although
   clay MS dominates the bulk MS signals, silt MS and sand MS affect the
   bulk MS signals in two ways: (1) changes in the percentages of silt and
   sand, and (2) mineralogical variations in silt MS and sand MS from one
   stratigraphic unit to another. This study demonstrates that 40\% of the
   variation in the bulk MS is accounted for by the clay MS and 56\% of the
   variation by the silt MS and clay MS together. After adding the sand MS,

Abstract = {{Effects of millet stover residue (0,500, and 2000 kg ha-1) on wind
   erosion and surface soil properties were determined from 1991 to 1993 at
   teh ICRISAT Sahelian Center in Niger, West Africa. Soil flux 0.1 m above
   the ground was significantly reduced with 2000 kg ha-1 residue but not
   with 500 kg ha-1. Topographic measurements indicated that soil removed
   from the soil surface was less with either residue level than in the
   control. After 2 y, the soil surface (0-0.01 m) of both residue
   treatments had less coarse sand than the control, but more fine sand and
   clay, more organic carbon and an increased cation exchange capacity. The
   organic-C content of blown material was greater than that of surface
   soil. An amount of 500 kg ha-1 residue can be considered useful for soil
   conservation, but 2000 kg ha-1 are required for a significant reduction
   of soil flux caused during severe wind erosion events.}},

Abstract = {{The beneficial effect of organic matter on soil aggregate stability is
   well documented. Alley cropping has been suggested as a possible
   alternative to maintain soil organic matter content in cropping systems
   without fallowing the land. The objective of this study was to asses the
   effect of alley cropping on dry and wet soil aggregate stability on land
   degraded by shifting cultivation. The aggregate size distribution by dry
   sieving, aggregate stability by wet sieving, soil organic Carbon content
   and soil bulk density were measured following two and three years of
   alley cropping with Gliricedia (Gliricidia sepium) and Pigeon pea
   (Cajanas cajan) in a tropical Rhodustalf. Alley cropping increased the
   mean aggregate diameter and water stability of soil aggregates. The mean
   aggregate diameter obtained from dry sieving increased from 1.3 mm of
   the control to 2.68 and 3.11 mm after three years in Pigeon pea and
   Gliricidia alley cropped plots, respectively. This is an indication of
   resistance to wind erosion in alley cropped plots. The wet aggregate
   stability which shows the resistance to erosion by water also increased
   in alley cropped plots. These increases were significant after three
   years of hedge row establishment. The increase in soil organic C in
   alley cropped plots contributed to the higher dry and wet aggregate
   stability, and decreased soil bulk density. The improvement was higher
   in plots alley cropped with Gliricidia than Pigeon pea. This study shows
   the importance of ally cropping in increasing aggregate stability of
   degraded sandy soils which in return reduce erosion by wind and water.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter and the abundance of subterranean termites were
   measured at 89 locations spaced at 30-m intervals from the bottom to the
   top of a small desert watershed. There was no correlation between soil
   organic matter content and topographic position on the watershed.
   Analysis by autocorrelogram demonstrated that the soil organic matter
   content was randomly distributed on the watershed. There was a highly
   significant negative correlation between termite abundance and soil
   organic matter, r = -0.97. Soils characterized by horizon in soil pits
   within each vegetation type (soil type) showed some relationships to
   erosion-deposition areas on the watershed, with surface organic matter
   contents varying between 3.4\% in the playa basin where termites were
   absent to 0.4\% in a sparse shrubland on erosional soils. In the
   northern Chihuahuan Desert, subterranean termites appear to be
   responsible for most of the variation in soil organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{The main soil chemical constraints on agricultural production systems in
   the Amazon include soil acidity, phosphorus (P) deficiency, and low
   effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). About 80\% of the Amazon has
   acid soils with pH values of less than 5.3 in the topsoil. Associated
   with soil acidity, is the problem of aluminum toxicity and phosphorus
   deficiency. The low soil ECEC of most Amazonian soils is also a major
   soil chemical constraint to plant productivity since the leaching of
   mobile nutrients (such as potassium) increases as ECEC decreases.
   Agroforestry systems have the potential to control erosion, maintain
   soil organic matter and soil physical properties, augment nitrogen
   fixation, and promote efficient cycling of the scarce nutrients in
   Amazonian soils. The rationale for supposing that agroforestry systems
   can alleviate the soil chemical constraints to food and fibre production
   is that the nutrient exports via the harvest of crop and animal
   products, erosion, leaching, volatilization, and the deterioration in
   soil physical properties due to cropping or grazing can be counteracted
   by the tree component via: 1) nutrient uptake by deep rooted trees
   allowing for capture and surface deposition via tree litter, of
   nutrients beyond the reach of crop roots (more efficient nutrient
   cycling), 2) increased amounts of organic (shoot and root) inputs to the
   soil help to maintain soil organic matter and thus improve soil
   structure and nutrient status, and 3) increased nutrient additions to
   the soil via nitrogen fixation.}},

Abstract = {{Soils of the Argentine humid pampa region are usually weakly structured
   due to its high silt content. Selecting crop sequence or tillage systems
   are an alternative in small farms for the protection of the soil against
   physical degradation and erosion given that conservation practices,
   grass meadows, and fertilizers are expensive and therefore rarely used.
   Evaluation of selected soil properties was conducted on soil sampled
   from a long-term tillage experiment with continuous soybean established
   in 1975 on a Typic Argiudoll silty loam soil in Argentina. Tillage
   treatments included conventional tillage with moldboard plow (CT),
   chisel plow (CP), and no till (NT). A comparison with continuous corn
   under NT was also carried out. Sampling was performed after the
   emergence of both crops in 1990. Tillage and cropping treatments
   affected properties related to soil slacking and dispersion to a greater
   extent than they did on aggregate size distribution. According to the De
   Leenheer and De Boodt index, aggregate stability within soybean soil
   classified as bad for CT, unsatisfactory for CP, and very good for NT,
   whereas the soil with corn under NT classified as excellent. The no
   tillage treatment within soybean had significantly more organic carbon
   in the 0-5 cm depth than CP or CT. Soil respiration was significantly
   higher in NT than in CT in the surface layer, while CT showed higher
   values in the 10-15 cm depth. Tillage treatments did not significantly
   affect microbial biomass under soybean cropping. The effect of
   monoculture corn versus monoculture soybean under NT on soil
   respiration, biomass and organic carbon was not significant. Soil pH in
   the 0-5 cm depth under soybean was in the order NT > CP > CT, whereas
   the soil with corn under NT was more acid than the soybean soil
   (P=0.05). Cation exchange capacity and exchangeable bases followed a
   similar trend. Organic carbon (0-5 cm depth) and aggregate stability
   were significantly correlated when samples from all treatments were
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{This research was designed to identify relationships between T-4464
   buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) survival and climatic and soil
   characteristics.  At 167 buffelgrass seeding sites in North America we
   collected climatic and soils data where the grass:  1) persisted over
   time and increased in area covered (spreads), 2) persisted over time but
   does not increase in area covered (persists), and 3) declined over time
   and all plants eventually died (dies).  At 30 sites in Kenya we
   collected climatic and soils data in the area where T-4464 seed was
   originally collected.  Only total soil nitrogen and organic carbon
   differed among survival regimes.  Total soil nitrogen and organic carbon
   concentrations were least where buffelgrass spreads, intermediate where
   the grass persists and greatest where the grass dies.  To predict
   buffelgrass survival among the 3 survival regimes, and between areas
   where the grass spreads or dies, we used discriminant function analyses.
   A model including organic carbon, total soil nitrogen, sand, clay,
   potassium and cation exchange capacity correctly classified 78\% (r2 =
   0.8) of the seeding sites in the 3 survival regimes.  A model including
   sand, total soil nitrogen, calcium, mean minimum temperature in the
   coldest month, annual precipitation and winter precipitation correctly
   classified 88\% (r2 = 0.8) of the seeding sites between spreads and
   dies.  Survival regime selection prior to brush control, seedbed
   preparation and sowing will reduce planting failure probabilities, soil
   erosion and economic losses, and enhance long-term beef production.}},

Abstract = {{Tall wheatgrass barriers have been successfully tested in the northern
   Great Plains for wind erosion control and plant protection.  Our
   objective was to document the passive formation of hillside terraces
   occasioned by grass barriers on a variable 2 to 4\% west to east slope. 
   Eleven double-row tall wheatgrass {[}Elytrigia elongata (Host) Nevski]
   barriers with 10 15-m-wide cropping intervals 530 m long were
   established in 1967 on a Williams loam (fine-loamy mixed, Typic
   Argiboroll) 11 km north of Culberton, Montana.  The barriers were
   oriented north and south in traditional field orientation.  In 1991 we
   established four transects 15 m apart across the barrier system and
   designated five sampling points along the transects in each cropping
   interval for a total of 200 sampling points.  To avoid confounding by
   slopes parallel to the barriers, we selected a segment of the barrier
   system on a near 0\% north to south slope for the measurements. 
   Elevation was determined at each point, and soil cores were taken to a
   depth of about 90 cm to determine depth to CaCO3 layer, and to determine
   total and organic carbon by 5 cm increments.  A stair-step pattern, with
   a maximum drop of 30 cm from one grass barrier to an adjacent cropping
   interval, was documented.  Depth to CaCO3 and organic carbon
   concentration increased downslope between barriers, showing soil
   movement.  Grass barriers may serve as a substitute for mechanically
   built terraces.}},

Abstract = {{An on-farm study was conducted on 4 sites (A, B, C and D) in Ohio to
   compare soil properties of the surface horizon of an uncultivated and
   non-eroded (NE) wooded soil with those of cultivated and eroded soils
   for the same series. Cultivated soil comprised of slight (S), moderate
   (M), severely (SV) eroded phases on upper landscape position and
   depositional (DP) phase on the foot slopes. There were significant
   differences in soil properties of surface horizon of the non-cultivated
   location (wooded site) compared with the cultivated locations. Mean soil
   bulk density of the NE sites was 1.03 Mg/m(3) compared with 1.40 Mg/m(3)
   for cultivated land. Among different erosion phases on cultivated land,
   the highest mean bulk density of 1.45 Mg/m(3) was observed on SV phases
   and the lowest bulk density of 1.33 Mg/m(3) on DP phases. Mean total
   porosity was 64.9\% for NE sites compared with that of 46.7\% for all
   cultivated sites. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) was highly
   variable and did not follow a consistent trend with regard to erosional
   phases. In general, however, laboratory measured K-s was significantly
   higher for NE sites than cultivated sites, e.g., 24.6 cm/hr vs. 5.29
   cm/hr. Available water capacity (AWC) decreased with increasing severity
   of erosion among cultivated phases. The mean AWC was 0.33 (volumetric
   fraction) for NE, 0.23 for Df, 0.22 for S, 0.20 for M, and 0.19 for SV
   phase, Percentage water stable aggregation (WSA) and mean weight
   diameter (MWD) were generally high for NE and SV phases. Mean soil
   organic carbon (SOC) was 3.47\% for NE, 1.13\% for S, 0.98\% for M,
   0.97\% for SV, and 1.45\% for DP phases. Mean pH was 6.5 for NE, 6.4 for
   S 6.1 for M, 7.2 for SV and 6.8 for DP phase. The available P was
   significantly lower on NE compare with cultivated land for sites A and
   C. The mean P content for soil at site A was 16 kg/ha for NE, 41 kg/ha
   for S, 46 kg/ha for M, 32 kg/ha for SV, and 59 kg/ha for DP phase. Mean
   CEC was 12 cmol/kg for NE, 11 for S, 12 for M, 16 for SV, and 12 for DP
   phase.}},

Abstract = {{A 38-m well section near Lanzhou at the semiarid western margin of the
   Loess Plateau, China, contained a continuous, high-resolution
   loess-paleosol sequence spanning the last 130,000 yr. Depth functions of
   micromorphological features, magnetic susceptibility, calcium carbonate,
   organic carbon, and median grain size provide the basis for
   pedosedimentary and associated paleoenvironmental reconstructions of
   three paleosol complexes (S1, Sm, and S0). Each pedosedimentary stage
   reflects the interaction of changing intensities of controlling
   monsoonal forces. Three periods of reduced dust inputs and enhanced
   pedogenic activity, notably bioturbation and weak leaching, can be
   identified from within the S1 pedocomplex. These `'soil-forming
   intervals'' were separated by phases of varying land surface instability
   characterized by arid dust deposition, semiarid accretionary
   pedogenesis, water reworking, and crust formation, or even freeze-thaw
   modification. The Sm pedocomplex represents an interval of relatively
   rapid dust accumulation with only minimal syndepositional modification
   and minor pedogenic alteration at ephemeral land surfaces. The S0
   pedocomplex is clearly more pedogenically developed, although erosion,
   reworking, and mixing by water have partly homogenized the property
   depth functions. (C) 1995 University of Washington.}},

Abstract = {{Hillslope deposits in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa are incised
   by gullies (dongas) which expose sequences of buried palaeosols
   developed within a succession of discontinuity-bounded colluvial

   to at least four geomorphic cycles, comprising gully cut-and-fill and
   palaeosol formation, on hillslopes in the region during the past 135 ka.
   Past attempts at dating colluvial stratigraphic units were limited to
   radiocarbon dating of associated palaeosol organic matter and authigenic
   soil carbonates.  This study presents a preliminary set of Infra Red
   Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) age determinations pertaining to
   deposition of the succession of colluvial units infilling and burying
   palaeogullies at several sites of stratigraphic, geochronological and
   palaeo-environmental importance in the region.  Interpretation of the
   IRSL and C-14 dates in the context of cyclical hillslope processes
   suggests that past episodes of palaeogully erosion and infill were not
   synchronous and individual palaeosol landsurfaces were diachronous

Abstract = {{Logging operations can cause soil profile disturbance and compaction.
   Soil profile disturbance and compaction change soil physical properties,
   which may reduce site productivity, increase soil erosion and degrade
   catchment water quality. This study was undertaken to measure the effect
   of logging on physical properties of the 0-100 mm surface soil in the
   Victorian Central Highlands, southeastern Australia. Soil physical
   properties were measured in the snig tracks, log landings, general
   logging areas (disturbed areas which were not occupied by snig tracks or
   log landings) and undisturbed areas. Within the general logging areas?
   measurements were made for three levels of soil profile disturbance:
   litter disturbed, topsoil disturbed and subsoil disturbed.
   The results indicated that logging significantly increased bulk density
   and decreased organic carbon and organic matter content, total porosity
   and macroporosity on over 72\% of the coupe area. However, on 35\% of
   the coupe area, the snig tracks, log landings and subsoil disturbed
   areas of the general logging area, bulk densities and macroporosities
   reached critical levels where tree growth could be affected. On these
   areas, organic carbon decreased between 27 and 66\%, bulk density
   increased between 39 and 65\% and macroporosity decreased between 58 and
   88\%.
   Saturated hydraulic conductivities decreased to critical levels for
   runoff to occur on over 72\% of the coupe area (topsoil and subsoil
   disturbed areas of the general logging area, snig tracks and log
   landings). On this area, the reduction in saturated hydraulic
   conductivity varied between 60 and 95\%.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative assessments of the impact of agricultural practises on soil
   quality have been hindered by the lack of basic spatial units for
   designing landscape-scale research projects. This paper builds on the
   relationship which has been demonstrated to exist between small (5 m by
   5 m) slope segments and soil distribution in order to define larger
   landform element complexes in till landscapes of southern Saskatchewan,
   Canada. Distinctive pedogenic regimes are associated with these
   complexes. These complexes were then used to stratify the landscape at
   four conterminous sites with different cultivation histories and to
   assess changes in indicators of soil quality. Soil redistribution (as
   assessed by Cs-137 redistribution) has had a major impact on these
   landscapes. The shoulder and level summit complexes have experienced
   continued high rates of soil loss. The shoulder complexes have lost 55\%
   of their original soil organic carbon (a loss of 64 mg ha(-1)) over 80
   years and 70\% of this loss is attributable to net soil export from
   these positions. The portions of the footslope complexes dominated by
   Orthic Black Chernozemic soils initially act as sediment deposition
   sites in the first 22 years of cultivation, but ultimately this soil is
   removed from these positions and a moderate decline in soil quality
   occurs. The Gleysolic-dominated portions of the footslopes and the level
   depressional complexes occupy 15\% of the landscape and are the major
   long-term sediment depositional sites; the biochemical indicators of
   soil quality (soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen) show a major
   and beneficial increase in these positions.}},

Abstract = {{General guidelines to reclaim saline or sodic soils do not adequately
   consider variables such as pH and the presence of organic matter that
   are known to affect soil stability. Poor structural stability of sodic,
   saline-sodic, and high-pa soils adversely influences crop yields;
   promotes piping, tunneling, and slope erosion; and can accelerate the
   failure of water conveyance systems. We evaluated six soil tests, used
   to measure physico-chemical properties, for their suitability to
   evaluate the structural stability of a calcareous, saline-sodic soil
   under reclamation. The stability tests were wilting point, plastic
   limit, coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE(rod)), water content at
   0.03 MPa, liquid limit, and dispersion index. The range of electrical
   conductivity (EC) studied was 0.5 to 20 dS m(-1), sodium adsorption
   ratio (SAR) 0 to 400 (mmol L(-1))(0.5), and pH 8.4 to 10.5. The results
   obtained indicate that the amount of water necessary for a soil to how
   under standard conditions for the liquid limit test decreased an average
   of 25\% when the EC decreased from 40 to 2 dS m(-1). The liquid limit
   and EC showed a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.785); therefore, the liquid
   limit was considered to be an appropriate index to evaluate the physical
   properties of a soil under a leaching process. Plasticity index and
   available cater were more useful in the evaluation of the mechanical
   properties of the soil when we used amendments. Liquid limit combined
   with the water content of the soil at 0.03 MPa was the most useful tool
   for evaluating soil structural stability during reclamation.}},

   addition to providing a sustained protection against soil erosion. We
   evaluated the changes in soil aggregation status (0-5 cm) and in other
   physical and chemical properties (0-15 cm) of a Malmo clay loam (Typic
   Cryoboroll, Black Chernozemic) subjected to three tillage and residue
   management systems after nine years in central Alberta with a subhumid
   temperate climate. The soil was cropped to spring barley (Hordeum
   vulgare L.) each year. The treatments included: no tillage, straw
   retained on the surface; tillage, straw incorporated into surface soil;
   and tillage, straw removed. Tillage consisted of two rotocultivations to
   a depth of 10 cm, one in late fall and another in spring before seeding.
   In the no till + straw treatment, the crop was directly seeded with a
   hoe drill.
   The no till + straw treatment provided 70 to 99\% residue cover,
   followed by till + straw (41 to 85\%) and till + no straw (6 to 14\%).
   Tillage significantly increased the soil surface roughness, while
   seasonal rainfall greatly reduced it. Although the no till + straw
   treatment had a smaller surface roughness, it would provide more
   effective and sustained runoff and erosion control owing to its greater
   residue cover and a greater amount of larger water-stable aggregates.
   This treatment had significantly greater organic carbon content, lower
   pH, lower particle density and greater electrical conductivity in the
   0-5-cm soil depth interval compared with the tilled treatments. The
   differences among treatments became less pronounced with depth. For the
   surface soil of the no till + straw treatment, the proportion of wind
   erodible (< 1 mm) and water-slakable micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm) was
   also smaller, and mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter
   greater compared to the tilled treatments. Soil structural stability
   increased due to straw addition and a better aggregate size distribution
   occurred due to a reduction in soil disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{A group of specialists was asked by the Environmental Protection Agency
   to use their judgment as to which soil variables would be most impacted
   by five scenarios of climatic change in deserts of North America that
   could occur over the next 40 years.  The following soil characteristics
   were evaluated in terms of their potential for change:  physical,
   chemical, and biological crusts; the vesicular layer; soil organic
   matter; organic C and N content; the C/N ratio; carbonate pool;
   inorganic N, P, and S; salinity levels; micro-element content; microbial
   community composition; free-living microbial N fixation;
   denitrification; ammonia volatilization; salinization rates; water
   infiltration; evaporation; lateral flow and leaching; wind and water
   erosion; and litter decomposition.  The Delphi approach was used to
   reach consensus on expected trends.  Computer modeling was used to
   integrate and project interactive changes.  We expect physical and
   chemical crusting, vesicularity, ammonium volatilization, soil erosion,
   and salt accumulation to increase and microphytic crusts to decrease
   under all scenarios of climatic change.  Both soil organic C and N will
   decline, especially under increased temperatures, whereas the C/N ratio
   will decline to its lowest range of possible values.  Both free and
   symbiotic N fixation should decline unless there is a shift to greater
   absolute precipitation during summers.  Only slight changes in soil P,
   S, and trace element contents are expected under any of the five
   scenarios of climatic change.  Production of litter will change
   relatively little, but its chemical quality will decrease and nutrient
   cycling will be accelerated when the vegetation shifts from perennials
   to annuals.  Use of the Century Model showed that soil organic matter is
   more sensitive to temperature changes than precipitation.  Indicators of
   desert ecosystem `'health'' that we identified are relatively low
   albedo, patchiness of plant cover and interspace (trend depends on
   context), changes in drainage patterns and microrelief, biological
   crusting, and ratios of microbial biomass C to total organic C.  Need
   for further research is outlined.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an attempt to integrate methods of landscape
   regionalization and already established model approaches which describe
   the soil water budget, the dynamics of soluble and adsorbed substances
   as well as the different processes of the soil nitrogen budget. This
   integration leads to the Catchment Related Water \& Substance Simulation
   System (CWSS), which gives the ability to carry out simulations for the
   area of small catchments. CWSS is a modular process-based system that
   simulates the soil water and ground water dynamics, surface runoff, soil
   heat budget and organic carbon and nitrogen transformation processes. It
   gives the ability to calculate water and substance budgets for a number
   of landscape cells, determined by the heterogeneity of soil conditions,
   elevation and landuse. Water and substance inputs into creeks, rivers
   and lakes concerning to the catchment area can be simulated with a high
   temporal resolution. There are many scientific and management
   applications, for which this system could be used. For example it could
   help address ecological issues like eutrophication, effects of global
   warming, water management and soil erosion. Methods of parameter
   estimation and procedures concerning the regional aspects of soil
   variability, elevation and landuse conditions are described. The
   combination with a geographical information system (GIS) and the
   deduction of input values from various data sets, which are available
   all over the country, are described. Some simulation results related to
   the catchment of Lake Belau (north Germany) will be discussed. In this
   area nitrate concentrations of ground water exceed the legal limit for
   drinking water (50 mg NO3/l) and a high degree of eutrophication
   characterizes the lake.}},

Abstract = {{Ninety years after the start of the Askov long-term fertilization
   experiment on sandy loam, bulk soil was taken from the 0-20 cm and 30-35
   cm depths of unfertilized (UNF), animal-manure (FYM) treated and
   mineral-fertilized (NPK) plots and analysed for textural composition,
   carbon content, pH, CEC, particle density and plasticity limits. 
   Undisturbed soil cores (100 cm3) from the 8-12 cm layer were brought to
   six different matric potentials and subjected to confined uniaxial
   compression, drop-cone penetration and annulus shear tests. 
   Water-retention curves based on seven matric potentials were produced
   for undisturbed cores from the 8-12 and 30-35 cm layers.  In the field,
   in situ shear strength of plough-layer soil was determined by a vane
   shear tester and a torsional shear box.
   FYM and NPK treatments increased the soil organic carbon content by 23
   and 11\% of the amount in UNF, respectively.  Corresponding increases
   observed in CEC were 17 and 11\%.  The water content at the lower and
   upper plastic limits both decreased from FYM to NPK to UNF.  Soil bulk
   density in the 0-20 cm layer was reduced in FYM and NPK treatments
   relative to UNF, whereas the volume of soil pores larger than 30 mum was
   unaffected by past fertilization.
   Soil receiving animal manure showed the greatest soil strength when
   exposed to annulus shear, drop-cone penetration and confined uniaxial
   compression tests.  Shear strength measurements indicated that the UNF
   sandy loam soil reacted like a sand, the increase in soil strength upon
   drying primarily being due to increased internal friction.  In contrast,
   soil from FYM and NPK treatments showed reactions typical of a loamy
   soil, the increase in soil strength during drying being caused by
   increased cohesion in the soil matrix.  The field tests employed were
   unable to detect the management-induced differences in soil physical
   parameters found in the laboratory tests.
   This study shows that physical soil properties related to conditions for
   tillage and traffic, to crop development and erosion are significantly
   influenced by differences in soil organic matter levels resulting from
   contrasting methods of fertilizer management.  Exhausting a loamy soil
   by long-term lack of fertilizer application severely affects the
   physical properties of the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of aggregates at the immediate soil surface affects the
   detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles. The aggregate
   stability (expressed as mean weight diameter, MWD) and erosion rate were
   tested for clayey surface soils at two different water contents. The
   soils consisted of six Oxisols, one Ultisol, three Vertisols, one
   Alfisol, and one Aridisol. The MWD was determined by wet sieving of 4.76
   to 8.00 aggregates, which were either air-dried (MWD(d)) or capillary
   prewetted at -0.5 kPa for 24 h (MWD(w)). Air-dried and prewetted
   (saturated from the bottom up for 2 h) soils were subjected to a 110-mm
   h-1 rain until a steady-state infiltration was reached. Runoff, sediment
   loss, and infiltration (for prewetted soil only) were monitored
   throughout the rain. The MWD(d) ranged from 0.18 to 4.80 mm, and the
   MWD(w) ranged from 0.44 to 5.66 mm. Prewetting increased the MWD for the
   oxidic or kaolinitic Oxisols and Ultisols and for one
   smectitc/kaolinitic Vertisol. The MWD(w) was positively related to CEC
   for highly weathered soils and negatively related for swelling soils,
   whereas base saturation was negatively related for both groups of soils.
   The DELTAMWD, which expresses the increase in stability caused primarily
   by a decrease in slaking, was greatest for soils rich in kaolinite and
   Fe and Al oxyhydroxides and low in organic carbon. The steady-state
   infiltration rate (I(s)) ranged from 1.8 (illitic soil) to 54.8 mm h-1
   (sandy loam kaolinitic soil). The I(s) was consistently less for
   swelling than for highly weathered soils, and it was related to the
   sand/clay ratio, sand, and water retained between -33 and -1500 kPa. The
   increased aggregate stability with prewetting was generally not
   reflected in smaller amounts of erosion and runoff, possibly because of
   the faster rate of wetting than for the stability test, a higher water
   table for the prewetted soil than for the air-dried soil, and the
   inclusion of smaller aggregates in the erosion tests. Prewetting
   decreased the time to ponding for three highly weathered Oxisols and the
   illitic Alfisol, increased steady-state runoff rate (Q(w)) for five
   highly weathered soils, increased sediment loss rate (Q(s)) for the
   illitic and for one highly weathered soil, and increased Q(s) on a
   stable Oxisol. Soil textural properties (usually clay and sand/clay) and
   `'binding'' agents (organic carbon and Fe and Al oxyhydroxides) were the
   significant independent variables included in the stepwise multiple
   linear regressions for I(s), Q(s), and Q(w).}},

Abstract = {{The productive capacity of a soil is often related to the chemical
   properties inherent in that soil. Erosion removes topsoil and exposes
   subsoil thereby changing the characteristic productivity of soils. An
   eight-state cooperative research project studied 15 soils subjected to
   varying degrees of natural or artificial erosion. Selected chemical
   properties for slightly, moderately, or severely eroded soils are
   reported for the Ap horizon for these soils and for depth to CaCO3
   accumulation and NO3-N accumulation in the upper profile. For most
   soils, erosion resulted in increases in pH and exchangeable Ca++ and K+.
   Decreases were noted in organic carbon, depth to CaCO3 accumulation,
   profile NO3-N, extractable P, CEC, and DTPA extractable-Zn, Fe and Mn.
   Mixed results were observed for base saturation, exchangeable Mg++ and
   Na+, and extractable K+.}},

Abstract = {{Chepil, Woodruff, and Siddoway, developers of the wind erosion equation
   (WEQ), suggest that the wind erodible fraction of any soil can be
   determined by dry sieving a sample of the surface soil.  The data base
   of soil information for the wind erosion equation was primarily from the
   Central Great Plains.  As other areas used the WEQ, questions about the
   erodible fraction based on soil texture alone began to surface.  To test
   soils outside the Great Plains, more than 3,000 samples have been sieved
   to identify the relationships between the erodible fraction of soils and
   the physical and chemical properties of the soil.
   From these results, the erodible fraction was computed from the
   percentage of sand, percentage of silt, sand/clay ratio, organic carbon,
   and calcium carbonate.  A correlation coefficient of 0.82 was obtained
   between computed erodible fraction using soil physical and chemical
   properties with average measured erodible fraction from standard compact
   rotary sieving from sites with at least 20 samples.  The erodible
   fraction of dryland soils was reduced an average of 14\% and of
   irrigated soils 24\% with moldboard plowing.}},

Abstract = {{The level of organic matter or carbon in agricultural soils depends on
   additions from crop residues and manures and on losses from erosion and
   decomposition.  The supply of C to soils is dependent on biomass yields,
   harvest index, and the proportion of feed C retained in the manure with
   different crops.  A simple mathematical procedure was used to estimate
   quantities of C supplied to the soil with different livestock systems. 
   This procedure involved the partitioning of C into residue, root, and
   animal components.  There were uncertainties, however, about the
   quantities of C originating from crop roots and C losses during manure
   storage.  Two typical livestock farm systems were compared; a swine
   system emphasizing grain crops, and a dairy system with grain and forage
   crops each in a typical rotation.  This study revealed that manure
   contributes a relatively small proportion of the C to soil compared to
   crop roots and residue, especially in swine systems, unless straw
   bedding is included.  The total quantity of C supplied to the soil was
   generally greater with the dairy system, primarily because of the
   inclusion of a legume/grass crop in the rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) is valuable, because of both its beneficial
   effect on soil quality and crop productivity and its potential to
   sequester C. Long-term experiments provide an opportunity to identify
   crop management practices that enhance or degrade soil quality. This
   study was initiated in 1931 to determine residue management effects on
   crop yield and SOM (organic C and N) in a winter wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.)-fallow system. The soil is a coarse-silty, mixed, mesic
   Typic Haploxeroll. Treatments include (units ha-1 crop-1) 22.4 Mg
   manure, 2.24 Mg pea vine residue, 0, 45, and 90 kg N with and without
   spring burning of straw, and 0 kg N with fall burning of straw. Yearly C
   and N inputs and removals have been determined since 1976, and
   calculated for prior periods. Soil C and N have been determined at
   almost-equal-to 11-yr intervals. Manure, which supplies 111 kg N ha-1
   crop-1, has consistently produced the highest yield and maintained the
   highest soil C and N contents. Other treatments initially yielded from
   80 to 90\% of the manure treatment, but have progressively declined in
   direct relation to decreasing soil N content. Low-fertility treatments
   currently yield from 43 to 57\% of the manure treatment. The change in
   soil C and N with time is nearly linear for all treatments, and highly
   correlated with residue input. Treatment effects on soil C and N have
   been confined to the top 30 cm of soil, but there has been a slow steady
   decline in C and N in the 30- to 60-cm zone that is not related to
   residue management.}},

Abstract = {{Ancient base-metal mining activity at Zawar has produced widespread and
   persistent dispersal of metals by the Tiri river, flowing past the
   region. With heavy input of mine and tailing water, the river sediments
   are enriched with heavy metals compared to the background sediments.
   Samples collected from the river bed have been analysed for Pb, Zn, Cu,
   Cd, Fe, Mn, Ca and Mg to recognise the extent of contamination and the
   geochemical process of dispersion.
   The river sediment is a mixture of natural erosional detritals, tailing
   discharges from the milling plant and hydrogenous precipitates. Besides
   the detrital carbonates derived from the dolomitic litho unit of the
   area, a significant amount of carbonate is likely to precipitate on the
   river bed due to influx of mine water. Correlation matrix and R-mode
   factor analyses revealed that coprecipitation of metals along with
   Fe-Mn-hydroxides is significant. Association of metals with the
   precipitated carbonates is by adsorption under alkaline to neutral pH
   conditions. Cu has poor association with the other heavy metals but has
   a strong affinity with the gross lithology of the sediments (i.e. Ca-Mg
   and Fe-Mn in the second factor).
   The heavy-metal concentrations are extremely variable in the sediments
   and have been recognised by several approaches such as: (a) extraction
   at pH 3; (b) total dissolution of sediment samples for bulk heavy-metal
   analysis; and (c) sequential chemical extraction.
   Geochemical partitioning of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd into exchangeable,
   carbonate, organic, multiple hydroxide and lithogenic pools
   (operationally defined by A. Tessier) has been brought out utilising a
   sequential chemical extraction scheme. Nondetrital carbonates are found
   to be the most efficient scavengers of Pb, Zn and Cd, whereas Cu goes
   for organics. The results emphasize the importance of the precipitated
   carbonates and organics as sinks for the heavy metals, even in presence
   of a high concentration of multiple hydroxides.
   Of all the metals, Cd appears to be the most mobile element and Zn has
   preferentially accumulated more in the sediments. The apparent mobility
   and potential bioavailability of the metals have been found to be in the
   order of Cd > Pb > Zn > Cu.}},

Abstract = {{The cumulative extent of soil redistribution by erosion and tillage was
   measured by comparing the Cs-137 content of a soil under intensive
   potato production with that of an undisturbed forest soil. Soil
   redistribution rates estimated from Cs-137 contents for the cultivated
   site varied from a loss of as high as 19.0 kg m-2 year-1 (190 t ha-1
   year-1) to a gain of as much as 4.3 kg m-2 year-1 (43 t ha-1 year-1),
   with an average of 5.3 kg m-2 year-1 (53 t ha-1 year-1) soil loss.
   Measured soit Cs-137 content and calculated soil loss (and deposition)
   were both found to be correlated with total potato yield (P<0.01), and
   with tuber specific gravity (P<0.05), in the two years of yield
   measurements (1991 and 1992). These years had near normal growing season
   precipitation, but contrasting distribution patterns of precipitation
   during the growing season. Estimated soil loss and gain were also
   correlated (P<0.01) with soil organic carbon and soil phosphorus
   contents. It is concluded that soil redistribution within the site,
   caused by either water erosion or tillage, or a combination of both
   these processes, had a marked effect on soil productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of trees on soil characteristics beneath and around the
   sub-canopy area has been well established in tropical and temperature
   regions.  A hypothesis may be inferred which predicts an amelioration of
   the soil between the tree canopies as a function of increased canopy
   cover.  This hypothesis has been tested at two sites in open vegetation
   dominated by Acacia tortilis trees and shrubs.  Three different canopy
   cover classes were used as independent variables whereas all other
   soil-forming factors (Jenny, 1941) (such as climate, parent material,
   slope, and time) were relatively uniform within each site.  The
   hypothesis was refuted at one side and verified at the other by means of
   ANOVA and Canonical Variate Analysis.  Total nitrogen and organic carbon
   increased and the C/N-ratio decreased as the canopy cover increased in
   the latter site.  Here a lower pH (CaCl2) correlated with high organic
   carbon.  At the site where the hypothesis was verified the number of
   individual tree and shrubs was higher and the size was smaller compared
   to the other site.  This structural difference may influence the effect
   of wind erosion and is suggested as an explanation of the discrepancy in
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Legume groundcovers have been promoted for controlling soil erosion in
   hillside banana plantations in northern New South Wales. An experiment
   was conducted at Alstonville to determine the effect of an Arachis
   pintoi (Pinto peanut) groundcover on banana productivity.
   The Arachis groundcover was slow to establish in the first year, but
   thereafter grew vigorously. While standing dry matter of groundcover was
   reduced at closer banana plant spacings, it was always more than
   adequate to control erosion. After 5.5 years many soil chemical
   parameters had been significantly affected by the presence of
   groundcover. Organic carbon concentrations to 30 cm depth were 5.6\%
   greater on the groundcover plots (3.94 v. 3.71\%), and total nitrogen
   was 8.5\% greater (0.42 v. 0.39\%). Other increases were exchangeable
   potassium 52\%, calcium 26\%, magnesium 43\%, sodium 23\%, electrical
   conductivity 24\%, and pH 0.13 units. Banana leaf nutrient
   concentrations were not affected.
   Banana plants with groundcover produced 9\% fewer bunches than their
   bare soil counterparts, with 4\% fewer fingers per bunch. By the end of
   the experiment, fingers on the groundcover treatment were 9\% lighter;
   consequently, the weight of marketable fruit (i.e. >120 g/finger) per
   bunch was reduced by 31\% in the final year. The presence of groundcover
   reduced total fruit production over the whole trial by 16\% and
   marketable fruit by 19\%. In the last year of the experiment, total
   fruit production was reduced by 25\%, and marketable fruit production by
   40\%. Over the whole trial, banana plants with groundcover produced 22\%
   fewer suckers than the bare soil controls, with most of the effect
   occurring in the first 2 years.
   Soil temperatures at 20 cm under groundcover were as much as 0.7 degrees
   C cooler than the controls in October-January, but similar for the rest
   of the year. This effect possibly contributed to decreased yields.
   Although the experiment was irrigated, the irrigation was possibly
   inadequate for the groundcover treatment, and competition for water
   between the Arachis and banana plants may also have been responsible for
   part of the yield depression. Rats fed on the buried Arachis seed each
   winter.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence and severity of water repellency was related to five soil
   class (FC I-V), based on the field texture and dry consistence of the
   soil surface horizons, derived from a soil survey near Jerramungup,
   Western Australia. Water repellency was most severe on the FC I soils
   (median clay content 1.5\%), with 66\% of samples having water
   repellency based on the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test >10 s.
   Corresponding values for the FC II and III soils (2.5\%, 4.0\% clay)
   were 37\% and 20\%. Water repellency did not occur on the most clayey FC
   IV (8.1\% clay) and FC V (22.1\% clay) soils.
   Following stratification of Ap horizon soils by 1\% increments of clay
   content, highly significant linear relationships occurred between log
   {[}water drop penetration time (WDPT)] and log {[}organic carbon (OC)]
   for the 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4\% clay classes, these respectively explaining
   50, 35 and 37\% of the variation in water repellency. The role of
   organic carbon in promoting water repellency decreases markedly with
   increasing clay content, with WDPT being proportional to OC4.5, OC3.9
   and OC3.0 for each of these clay classes. A multivariate relationship
   using measures of amorphous iron, clay and organic matter explained 63\%
   of the variation in water repellency, and this multivariate dependency
   provides an explanation of the poor bivariate relationships between
   either clay or organic carbon content and water repellency reported in
   previous studies.
   There is a strong geomorphic control of the clay content in the soil
   surface horizons. Given the effect that clay content has on water
   repellency, the susceptibility of soils to water repellency can be
   mapped across farms, with the actual expression of water repellency
   depending on soil organic matter content, and hence land use. Such
   discrimination will allow the prediction of water erosion hazard and
   identify soils requiring ameliorative treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of the caesium-137 (Cs-137) technique, for estimating the
   effects of wind erosion, was evaluated on the soils of a semi-arid
   agricultural area near Jerramungup, Western Australia.  The past
   incidence of wind erosion was estimated from field observations of soil
   profile morphology and an existing remote sensing study.  Erosion was
   limited to sandy surfaced soils (0-4\% clay), with a highly significant
   difference (P < 0.0001) in Cs-137 values between eroded and non-eroded
   sandy soils, with mean values of 243+/-17 and 386+/-13 Bq m-2
   respectively.  Non-eroded soils, with larger clay contents, had a mean
   Cs-137 content of 421+/-26 Bq m-2, however, due to considerable
   variation between replicate samples, this value was not significantly
   different from that of the non-eroded sands.  Hence, although the
   technique discriminates between eroded and non-eroded areas, the large
   variation in Cs-137 values means that from 27 to 96 replicate samples
   are required to provide statistically valid estimates of Cs-137 loss.
   The occurrence of around 18\% of the total Cs-137 between 10 and 20 cm
   depth in these soils, despite cultivation being confined to the surface
   9 cm, suggests that leaching of Cs-137 occurs in the sandy soils,
   although there was no relationship between clay content and Cs-137 value
   for either eroded or non-eroded soils.  In a multiple linear regression,
   organic carbon content and the mean grain size of the eroded soils
   explained 35\% of the variation in Cs-137 content.  This relationship
   suggests that both organic carbon and Cs-137 are removed by erosion,
   with erosion being more prevalent on soils with a finer sand fraction. 
   Clay and silt contents do not vary with depth in the near-surface
   horizons of the eroded sandy soils, hence it is likely that wind erosion
   strips the entire surface horizon with its Cs-137 content, rather than
   selectively winnowing fine material.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to determine the effects of tillage
   systems on selected chemical properties of a sloping and eroded soil
   which had previously been in sod. A tillage project was initiated in the
   spring, 1989 in southern Illinois on a soil with a root-restricting
   fragipan. Com (Zea mays L.) and soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were
   grown on the plot area on a yearly rotation system. Prior to the
   application of lime or tillage treatments the 0-15 cm Ap horizon had a
   pH of 6.3, organic carbon (C) of 1.4 g/100 g, and CEC equal to 17
   meq/100 g. Lime had been surface applied early in the spring of 1989
   prior to moldboard (MP) and chisel (CP) plowing. Moldboard plowing had
   lower pH than the other treatments in the 0-5 cm layer in 1989 due to
   the moldboard plow mixing low pH subsoil material into the 0-5 cm layer
   and mixing surface applied lime into the 5-15 cm layer. During the 4th
   year, organic C was lowest for MP (1.28 g/100 g) and highest for no
   tillage (NT) (1.65 g/100 g), with CP having organic C content of 1.52
   g/100 g in the 0-5 cm layer. The differences in organic C were
   attributed to the effects of incorporation of plant residues below the
   0-5 cm layer in the moldboard and chisel plow treatments. Effects of
   tillage on organic C content were not significant in the 5-15 cm layer.
   Soil phosphorus (P) (Bray Pl) and extractable potassium (K) were
   stratified, with the largest amounts of these two elements found within
   the top 5 cm of soil. In general, tillage did not have any significant
   (P=0.05) effect on either extractable calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg).
   Differences were observed in exchangeable ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) and
   nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) by tillage treatments and were affected by
   soil moisture content and previous crop residues. Cation exchange
   capacity (CEC) was lower for MP at the 0-5 cm layer as compared to NT
   and CP in the 3rd year. At the 5-15 cm layer CEC was lower for NT as
   compared to CP and MP. The differences in CEC were attributed to the
   observed differences in organic C and possibly the effects of moldboard
   and chisel plow mixing subsoil materials slightly higher in clay content
   into the Ap horizon.
   In 1989, com grain yield for NT was significantly lower than MP and CP.
   In 1990, 1991 and 1992 the crop yields by tillage treatment were not
   significantly different. Any conversion of conservation reserve land
   from sod into NT corn and soybean production could experience similar
   management problems and corn yield reductions the first year. The
   initial yield advantage MP system had the 1st year did not occur the
   last three years. Based on four years of observation, no-till and chisel
   plow systems may better maintain long-term productivity of sloping soils
   than moldboard plow systems because of changes in distribution and
   availability of nutrients and organic C in the 0-5 cm layer, reduced
   soil erosion, and yield trends.}},

Abstract = {{Heat-induced changes in the soil-solution and post-wildfire erosion can
   create chemically and texturally diverse seedbed microsites. We
   quantified organic carbon, extractable NH4+ after incubation (aerobic
   and anaerobic), and emergence of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), by
   particle size fractions, in unburned and simulated burned sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata Nutt.) subcanopy soil. For all
   particle size fractions, significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05)
   more extractable NH4+ and significantly less extractable NO3- were
   measured in heated material as compared to unheated material. Heated
   treatments had significantly more NH4+ and significantly less NO3-
   mineralized after 11 days aerobic incubation than after unheated
   treatments; net N mineralized tended to be higher for all particle
   fractions in heated treatments than in unheated treatments. Emergence of
   cheatgrass under aerobic conditions was significantly retarded in all
   heated treatments. Elevated NH4+ to NO3- ratios in the soil-solution
   following heating does not explain suppression of cheatgrass emergence.
   Nitrogen mineralization, before and after simulated burning, is adequate
   in all particle size fractions to support the needs of germinating
   seeds. Nitrogen mineralization was not enhanced by the presence of
   growing cheatgrass plants.}},

Abstract = {{Forest floor samples from early. intermediate and mature successional
   sites in the taiga of interior Alaska were exposed to C-14-labeled
   glucose and two phenolic acids. Our results indicate that microbes
   present in the taiga forest floor metabolized phenolics. At all sites,
   biomass incorporation of glucose as measured by the fumigation
   extraction technique was approximately twice that for the phenolics,
   while respiration of (CO2)-C-14 was significantly higher for the
   phenolic compounds. Major differences in C-14 allocation were seen even
   between phenolic compounds with similar structures. Despite large
   differences in litter and forest floor composition, the metabolism of
   our model compounds varied only slightly between successional stages.
   Seasonal and successional effects were considerably less than those
   arising from substrate quality with variation greater in the uplands
   (where succession is fire-dominated) than in the floodplains (where
   river erosion and deposition are the controlling factors). Any
   physiological variation in microbial communities through succession must
   therefore be in organisms which produce exoenzymes that break down
   primary polymers, rather than in organisms and pathways that use the
   monomer breakdown products.}},

Abstract = {{A seven-year tillage trial was conducted in central New South Wales,
   Australia to measure the effect and extent of conservation tillage
   practices on soil physical and chemical properties. Three tillage
   treatments, traditional tillage (TT), reduced tillage (RT) and direct
   drilling (DD) were imposed on hardsetting red-brown earths at Cowra and
   Grenfell. A fourth treatment, direct drilling without grazing (NT) was
   imposed at Cowra only.
   At Cowra there was a significant trend of reduced total runoff in the DD
   and NT treatments but not in the RT treatment. Runoff significantly
   increased in the TT treatment.
   At Grenfell, runoff decreased in all treatments but only significantly
   in the DD and RT treatments. Similar trends in total sediment loss were
   measured at both sites.
   Associated physical measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity,
   sorptivity and bulk density confirmed that the changes in runoff were
   due to the creation of macroporosity greater than 0.75 mm diameter. The
   relationship between macroporosity, organic carbon and aggregate
   stability is discussed. Conclusions were that in these soil types runoff
   and sediment loss were affected more by destruction of macroporosity due
   to cultivation than changes in organic carbon from residue retention. To
   achieve these soil improvements using conservation tillage a continuous
   cropping period of four years was necessary to obtain significant and
   consistent trends.
   Soil chemical data showed that total nitrogen increased with
   conservation tillage practices. Available phosphorus changes due to
   tillage were not observed because of more than adequate fertiliser
   applied. Soil pH decreased significantly in the DD and NT treatments at
   Cowra only. The implications of these chemical changes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric C (TAC) is continuously transported by rivers at the
   continents' surface as soil dissolved and particulate organic C (DOC,
   POC) and dissolved inorganic C (DIC) used in rock weathering reactions.
   Global typology of the C export rates (g.m-2.yr-1) for 14 river classes
   from tundra rivers to monsoon rivers is used to calculate global TAC
   flux to oceans estimated to 542 Tg.yr-1, of which 37 \% is as DOC, 18 \%
   as soil POC and 45 \% as DIC. TAC originates mostly from humid tropics
   (46 \%) and temperate forest and grassland (31 \%), compared to boreal
   forest (14 \%), savannah and sub-arid regions (5 \%), and tundra (4 \%).
   Rivers also carry to oceans 80 Tg. yr-1 of POC and 137 TG.yr-1 of DIC
   originating from rock erosion. Permanent TAC storage on land is
   estimated to 52 Tg.yr-1 in lakes and 17 Tg.yr-1 in internal regions of

Abstract = {{In loamy Hapludalfs and sandy Haplorthods under forest and cultivation,
   the annual C, Al and Fe balances are presented in order to indicate
   element transfer into the subsoil. Aluminium and iron in the soil
   solution are separated into inorganic and organic fractions. In the
   Typic Hapludalf under forest initial podzolization is documented by an
   increase in Al release, its translocation into the subsoil and soil
   acidification. The Al3+ concentration is 2.7 mg l-1 and probably
   phytotoxic. The Hapludalfs under cultivation are influenced by stagnant
   water and the main part of iron is translocated in iron-organic
   complexes from the Bt into the subsoil. The aluminium release and
   transfer is minimal. In one Hapludalf erosion hinders an accumulation of
   humus, in spite of a C surplus. Extensive soil management in the forest
   and intensive cultivation without application of manure are incompatible
   with soil protection. In a Typic Haplorthod under spruce, podzolization
   is documented by the translocation of carbon and especially aluminium. A
   low pH induces weathering of soil minerals with a high release of Al3+
   and its translocation into the subsoil. Its concentration in the topsoil
   is extremely phytotoxic. In a similar Typic Haplorthod under cultivation
   the carbon and metal sink (Bh/Bhs) is being decomposed and has become a
   source of carbon and iron-organic complexes; these are translocated into
   the subsoil. The natural accumulation process has been reversed by man.}},

Abstract = {{The Chernobyl nuclear accident took place on 1986-04-26, and resulted in
   radionuclide pollution of vast regions of Byelorussia. This has raised
   several geochemical problems: (1) investigation of the distribution and
   behaviour of radionuclides in the natural and technogenic landscapes
   (which were examined as a result of a 5-a study); (2) modes of
   occurrence of radioactive elements in the environment; and (3)
   preliminary estimation of radionuclide migration in the future. As
   background information. geochemical studies carried out within
   Byelorussia, as well as landscape investigations in the period 1953-1987
   made under the guidance of K. 1. Lukashev were very important for
   solving the above questions. According to the results of these
   investigations, the lithogeochemical and hydrogeochemical zoning of
   Byelorussia is understood and the radioactive background of the republic
   was studied in the 1960s, as well as the distribution and peculiarities
   of clay minerals, carbonates, Fe-Mn oxides, organic matter, pH-Eh. and
   the contents of many elements in the surficial deposits of Byelorussia.
   All these factors arc of great importance for understanding the
   behaviour of radionuclides.
   Radionuclide fallout on Byelorussia in the first days after the accident
   was mainly dependent on the mass movement of air and rain. In cities,
   fallout was confined to regions with intensive industrial dust
   emissions, as well as to river valleys, where degassing of deep-seated
   zones through faults occurred side by side with evaporation.
   Radionuclide washout from upland territories can be related to secondary
   processes.
   After 5 a, the radioactive emission near the surface of the Earth
   decreased due to the decay of short-lived isotopes and penetration of
   radionuclides deeper into the soil, although the major part still occurs
   at a depth of 1-5 cm. Bogs, peat-bog soils, aquifers with fluctuating
   groundwater levels, variable pH-Eh conditions and a high biological
   activity are all factors contributing to radionuclide migration in the
   Byelorussian landscape. A part of the radionuclides is gradually removed
   from eluvial landscapes and accumulated in subareal landscapes (e.g.
   lakes, oxbow-lakes, water-storage basins).
   The Chernobyl debris are represented by the following substances:
   `'hot'' particles, pseudocolloids, aerosols and gaseous compounds. Study
   of the modes of occurrence of radionuclides by different methods (e.g.
   extracts, sorbents) made it possible to estimate the migration capacity
   of some radionuclides (Cs, Sr, Ce, Ru), and to distinguish two zones
   around the reactor-the nearest and remote ones-differing in the ratio of
   `'hot'' particles and condensate fallout, which causes a different
   migration capacity of radionuclides.
   A very important part is assigned to biological processes and organic
   matter, which cause the destruction of `hot'' particles, the formation
   of organometallic complexes, and water migration of nuclides.
   In the future (within 300 and more years), the redistribution of
   radionuclides in the landscape involves processes of weathering, erosion
   and sedimentation which will strongly depend on climatic conditions.
   Side by side with a gradual decay of Cs and Sr, an appreciable
   accumulation of Am-241, which is very mobile in landscapes, should be
   expected due to decaying Pu-241.
   A considerable development of scientific and applied exploration should
   also be expected in the future and this will help in solving problems of
   radioactive pollution of landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The 1987 National Resources Inventory (NRI) was used to provide a random
   sample of 100 Illinois cropland sites growing corn and soybeans. These
   were used with the Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model
   to simulate responses of soil erosion and nutrient exports to several
   different tillage and crop rotation practices.  The NRI and other data
   sources were used for site specific characterizations that reflected the
   multidimensional variability in site conditions in Illinois. Four
   alternative management schemes were simulated for each site:  continuous
   corn and soybean/corn rotations under conventional tillage and no-till.
   Average crop yields varied little under the four management schemes and
   closely corresponded to expected yields from the SCS Soils-5 Soil
   Interpretation Records. However, no-till significantly reduced soil
   erosion rates and loss of soil organic carbon compared to conventional
   tillage.  This reduced erosion under no-till also led to reduced losses
   of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in eroded soil. Percolation below the
   root zone represented the greatest N export and is of concern for the
   issue of groundwater contamination in this region. Nitrate N
   concentrations in percolate substantially exceeded the drinking water
   standard of 10 mg/l. Soybean/corn rotations generally bad 10-30 percent
   lower soluble N losses in surface runoff, subsurface flow, and
   percolation than the corresponding conventional tillage or no-till
   practices under continuous corn. No-till resulted in a 24 percent
   increase in soluble N runoff losses compared to conventional tillage in
   soybean/corn rotations. P losses in surface runoff were larger under
   no-till, likely as a result of the lack of immediate incorporation of
   surface P fertilizer into the soil. The model predictions for changes in
   soil erosion and N and P losses under different management practices
   were in line with measured changes in site-specific field studies under
   similar conditions. Our study results take into account the effect of
   site-to-site variability on the responses and the relative frequency of
   different site conditions state-wide.  This indicates the potential
   magnitude for changes in nonpoint source pollution by sediment, N, and P
   state-wide by adoption of alternative corn and soybean tillage and
   rotation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role in maintaining tropical
   soil fertility. Its conservation and maintenance in tropical cultivation
   systems is imperative if soil degradation is to be halted and cropping
   made sustainable. Around 22-23\% of global carbon is present in tropical
   ecosystems but only 2-3\% of this is present in the soil. Fluxes of CO2
   to the atmosphere from tropical soils after deforestation contributes to
   the greenhouse effect and could represent a 1-4\% increase in the
   overall steady-state annual CO2 release to the atmosphere.
   The composition of SOM is extremely diverse, with active, or labile,
   fractions decomposing in a matter of months while the more resistant, or
   nonlabile, fractions remain in soil for many years. SOM plays a central
   role in providing good soil structure, in supplying nutrients and in
   providing ion exchange capacity in tropical soils. Organic matter
   decomposition rates in tropical soils are generally faster than in
   temperate soils because decay of the nonlabile fraction is generally
   faster.
   Changes in tropical land use have profound effects on SOM status.
   Tropical deforestation causes significant losses of soil carbon and
   nitrogen which tend to decline further under continuous cultivation.
   Reasons for declines in soil fertility include accelerated soil erosion,
   loss of litter influx after canopy removal and enhanced decomposition
   and nutrient mineralization rates after forest clearance. A wide range
   of soil management techniques have been designed to conserve and improve
   SOM stocks in tropical cultivation systems. These include agroforestry
   techniques, intercropping with legumes and the use of mulches and other
   organic inputs. While many of these techniques look promising in terms
   of improved crop yields, there is urgent need for research on how these
   practices alter the physical, chemical and biological processes and
   conditions of tropical soils.}},

Abstract = {{Research techniques that have greatly advanced agronomic science in the
   20th century, and have enhanced our knowledge of cause and effect, have
   been accompanied by reductionism. As a result, much valuable research
   has been accomplished, but less synthesis of results has occurred that
   provides answers to landscape-level research questions. We propose that
   a systems approach to the study of soil and crop management problems is
   a useful technique that tests our present research knowledge in a way
   that answers practical agricultural problems and simultaneously
   identifies gaps in basic research knowledge. We have used a problem
   common to the Great Plains to demonstrate the systems approach:
   minimizing the soil- and environment-degrading practice of summer
   fallowing and simultaneously increasing farm profitability. Although
   much is known about summer fallow at specific locations, less is known
   about extrapolating this knowledge across soil and climatic gradients.
   We show that intensified crop sequences under no-till techniques can
   replace summer fallow in many environments, and increase the
   productivity per unit of water received. Simultaneous reductions in the
   damaging factors of summer fallowing, in particular soil erosion and
   organic matter losses, also have occurred. We are researching the
   problem at a landscape level without losing the ability to detect causae
   and effect, and are able to simultaneously conduct basic research on
   soil nutrient cycling and water budgets. The approach also is being used
   effectively as an adult educational tool, thereby facilitating the
   transfer of technology from the researcher to the producer.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural soils act as both a source and a sink for atmospheric
   carbon. Since the onset of cultivation, the 211.5 million ha of
   agricultural soils in the former Soviet Union (FSU) have lost 10.2 Gt of
   carbon. No-till management represents a promising option to increase the
   amount of carbon sequestered in the agricultural soil of the FSU.
   No-till management reduces erosion and sequesters additional carbon in
   the soil by lowering the soil temperature and raising soil moisture.
   To determine the carbon sequestered under no-till management, a data
   base containing precultivation estimates of soil carbon for the seven
   major classes of soil found in the agricultural areas of the FSU was
   used to establish an equilibrium carbon content for each soil. Other
   published data provided a method to quantify the change in soil carbon
   brought about by converting to no-till management. Soils suitable for
   no-till management were analyzed and estimates of changes in carbon
   storage were made.
   No-till management is not suitable in areas where crop production is
   limited by cold, wet soils. Based on the results of a geographic
   information system analysis using maps of climatic factors and soil
   characteristics, 181 million ha in the FSU were identified as
   climatically suitable for no-till management almost 86\% of all
   agricultural land). Complete conversion of all climatically suitable
   land to no-till management would sequester 3.3 Gt of carbon. This
   represents a 10\% increase in carbon in the agricultural soils of the
   FSU. This estimated accumulation of carbon is associated with a new soil
   carbon equilibrium condition. Accumulation of carbon in the soil
   produced by a conversion from conventional to no-till management is
   expected to take at least 10 years. The carbon accumulation produced by
   conversion to no-till management is not a continuing process; once a new
   no-till equilibrium condition has been reached, additional quantities of
   atmospheric carbon will not be sequestered in agricultural soils through
   continued no-till management.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies conducted in western Canada have assessed how crop rotations
   and fertilization influence soil organic matter content on land that has
   been cropped for many years. We monitored soil organic matter in the 0-
   to 0.15- and 0.15. to 0.3-m depths of a 24-yr crop rotation experiment
   conducted on a medium-textured Aridic Haploboroll in southwestern
   Saskatchewan. Prior to the study, the land had been in a hard red spring
   wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow rotation for almost-equal-to 50 yr.
   Only the 0- to 0.15-m segment showed significant treatment effects. Due
   to good weather and crop yields in the first 15 yr, soil organic matter
   had increased under well-fertilized annually cropped rotations, and it
   remained constant under fallow-containing rotations and under continuous
   wheat receiving inadequate N fertilizer. Because of several dry years in
   the regnal 9 yr of the study, all rotations except a well-fertilized,
   fallow-winter cereal-wheat system lost organic matter. Changes in
   organic matter were directly related to the amount of crop residues
   produced by these systems and their ease of eroding. Soil organic matter
   was inversely related to apparent N deficit (i.e., N exported in grain
   minus N applied as fertilizer). The fallow-flax (Linum usitatissimum
   L.)-wheat rotation receiving N and P fertilizer had the lowest soil
   organic matter, partly due to low production of crop residues by flax,
   partly to greater leaching of NO3, and partly due to some loss of flax
   residues blown from the plots. Soil organic matter in the
   well-fertilized fallow-winter cereal-wheat rotation remained constant
   because its shorter fallow period reduced soil erosion, and due to its
   more efficient use of N, as evidenced by minimal leached NO3-N.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of soil tillage and crop rotation on humic substances of an
   oxisol from southern Brazil were studied. Soils were sampled from
   conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems applied to soybean-wheat
   (S-W) and soybean-lupine-maize-wheat (S-L-M-W) rotations. Two additional
   samples from soils with secondary forest and eucalyptus were collected.
   Humic substances (HS) were extracted by chelating ion exchange resin and
   water. Grey humic acids (GHA), brown humic acids (BHA) and fulvic acids
   (FA) were analysed chromatographically on controlled pore glass.
   As expected, cultivation and tillage led to a decrease in soil organic
   carbon content. This diminution was somewhat lower in conventional
   tillage with S-L-M-W, compared with S-W rotation.
   The total amount of extractable HS was higher for forest soils.
   Cultivated soils with both CT and NT showed higher contents of GHA than
   BHA and FA. Crop rotation had an important influence on the quality of
   the organic matter as the S-W rotation with both CT and NT showed the
   highest GHA contents.
   Soils with eucalyptus exhibited the highest amount of extractable humic
   substances among the investigated soils.}},

Abstract = {{Soils under intensive cultivation have altered due to water erosion.
   This study was conducted to determine whether soil organic matter (SOM)
   composition of the colluvial source (Ap horizons) differs from the
   colluvial sink (M horizons). The SOM of a sandy Catena with erodic
   Cambisols and colluvic soils (Colluvisols) in Schleswig-Holstein,
   Northwest Germany, was investigated. A wet chemical analysis was
   combined with CPMAS C-13-NMR spectroscopy. In one case a significant
   correlation between the SOM composition of the Ap horizon of the erodic
   Cambisol and the M horizon of the Colluvisol was high (r2 =
   0.904{*}{*}{*}), whereas the con-elation for the other set was much
   weaker (r2 = 0.640{*}). Two possible paths of pedogenesis are discussed.
   About 70 \% of the SOM of the colluvial source is decomposed during
   translocation or after deposition. A selective preservation or new
   formation of humins in the M material is probable. These humins contain,
   obviously, large amounts of polysaccharides, which were not detected by
   the wet chemical analysis. Further investigations of colluvic and erodic
   soils are necessary in order to specify the SOM quality and its possible
   modification due to soil translocation and accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional land-use system in the agricultural belt of the
   Venezuelan High Andes (3,000-4,000 m) includes extended fallows (from 7
   to more than 20 years) alternating with short cultivation periods (1-4
   years). This management produces a mosaic landscape where potato or
   cereal fields coexist with recuperating fallows of various ages and with
   land remaining uncultivated because of limitations of slope or
   stoniness. This land-use strategy maintains a high natural diversity in
   a way that allows an acceptable productivity without the use of mineral
   fertilizers. The ecological base underlying the functioning of the
   agricultural system is analyzed, mainly in relation to the recuperation
   of nutrients during the fallow periods. The ecological sustainability is
   discussed in light of the negligible erosion rates and the maintenance
   of high levels of soil organic matter. The massive introduction of
   chemical fertilizers in recent years induced important changes that are
   exemplified by the case study of the land-use strategy of a farmer.}},

Abstract = {{Tillage systems that address soil conservation and sustainable crop
   yield need to be developed. Research was conducted on a Walla Walla silt
   loam (Typic Haploxeroll) to determine the long-term (19 years) effect of
   four tillage systems on soil properties and crop yield in a green pea
   (Pisum sativum L.)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation that was
   started in 1968. The experimental design was a split plot with four
   replications. Wheat and peas were grown each season. The primary tillage
   systems were: (T1) fall moldboard plow after wheat and after peas
   (control); (T2) fall rototill after wheat and fall sweep after peas;
   (T3) spring moldboard plow after wheat and fall moldboard plow after
   peas; (T4) no tillage after wheat and fall sweep after peas. Soil
   measurements included bulk density, pH, organic carbon, penetration
   resistance, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Profiles of bulk
   density, penetration resistance and pH revealed unique differences among
   treatments. However, there were no consistent differences in yield among
   the four tillage systems, in either green peas or wheat. From a crop
   production viewpoint, changes in soil properties on these tillage plots
   were inconsequential. From a soil erosion viewpoint, spring plowing (T3)
   and conservation tillage (T4) have an advantage over T2 and T1 because
   surface cover is maintained during the first winter following wheat
   harvest. Results show the importance of testing tillage systems over
   long periods of time and that the traditional system of fall moldboard
   plowing after wheat and after peas can be replaced by conservation
   systems without yield loss.}},

Abstract = {{A deposit of post-glacial organo-calcareous silt 25-40 m thick blankets
   the floor of Suva Harbour and its marginal inlets, including Draunibota
   Bay, on the southeast coast of Viti Levu, Fiji. This deposit is notable
   for its involvement in a large number of foundation failures in the
   area. The organo-calcareous silt is the latest sedimentary infill over a
   late Pleistocene erosional surface which is dissected characteristically
   down to around 50 m below current mean sea level at the harbour margins,
   and to at least 90 m at the seaward end of the study area. The gross
   distribution of Pleistocene and Holocene sedimentary units is strongly
   influenced by Pliocene graben formation in the Mio-Pliocene bedrock. The
   silt deposit forms part of a transgressive and highstand systems tract
   related to the latest glacio-eustatic sea-level rise, and includes a
   series of lobate delta deposits currently prograding at the mouths of
   streams entering the harbour. The silt was deposited in a
   lagoonal/estuarine environment of restricted circulation in a
   marginal/back-barrier reef situation and received a variety of marine
   carbonate and terrigenous sediment contributions, as well as organic
   substances from both autochthonous and allochthonous sources.
   Undisturbed sampling indicates the silt to be homogeneous, non-layered
   and thoroughly bioturbated, but a distinct layering with a spacing in
   the order of 1-5 m, probably related to periodic influxes of terrigenous
   material, is obvious on continuous seismic profiles. Acoustic turbidity
   due to biogenic gas in thick accumulations over palaeo-channels may well
   represent zones of high pore fluid pressure, and indicate lower
   effective soil strength. There is also evidence that the passage of the
   overpressured gas front results in hydraulic fracturing and consequent
   degassing of the silt. The silt deposit displays a slight upward
   coarsening in response to shoaling conditions, accompanied by an upward
   increase in both organic carbon and calcium carbonate proportions, and a
   decreasing terrigenous contribution. The increase in organic carbon is
   closely mirrored by increased diagenetic development of
   bacterially-deposited agglomerates of iron sulfide crystals in the pore
   spaces. The resulting pore-space microstructure appears to exert a
   direct control on the in-situ void ratio, and hence directly affects the
   consolidation and strength characteristics of the sediment. Radiocarbon
   dates from the silt deposit indicate a consistent rate of deposition in
   the Draunibota palaeo-channel of 4.3 m/1000 yr since the marine
   transgressive front passed the site some 9600 yr B.P. The dates extend
   the reliable local sea-level data for southeast Viti Levu back some
   further 4000 years, and support an earlier contention that sea level
   reached its current position here at around 4000-4500 yr B.P., about
   2000 years later than on the coast of southeast Australia. Water depth
   at the Cement Works Bridge site reached a maximum of 20 m some 5000 yr
   B.P. and, subsequently, has gradually shoaled to its present position
   just below mean sea level.}},

Abstract = {{To analyze the changes induced by cultivation such as soil erosion and
   soil organic matter depletion, we examined Andisols in Japan, by
   comparing the morphological characteristics and organic matter contents
   of seven cultivated soils (cultivation for 270 y) with those of four
   uncultivated soils (vegetation consisting of deciduous broad-leaved
   trees) on the Musashino plateau. The 2Bw or 3Bw horizons corresponding
   to the upper part of the Tachikawa loam layer No. 2 (Tc. 2) with red and
   black scoriae in close contact, were observed at 90-97 cm and 45-72 cm
   depths from the soil surf ace, respectively in the uncultivated and
   cultivated sites. The differences in the soil thickness from the surface
   to the top of Tc. 2 between the uncultivated and cultivated soils
   suggested that the soils were eroded as a result of cultivation for crop
   production. The A horizon thickness was 52-80 cm in the uncultivated
   soils, and 22-52 cm in the cultivated soils. As a result of the decrease
   of the A horizon thickness due to cultivation, the area based contents
   of organic matter in the most of the cultivated soils were markedly
   lower than those of the uncultivated soils. However, in one cultivated
   soil, the area based contents of organic matter did not decrease, and
   the changes in the area based content of organic matter induced by
   cultivation exhibited a wide range among cultivated soils. There were no
   statistical differences in soil color, bulk density, and concentrations
   of organic carbon and total nitrogen between the uncultivated A2 and
   cultivated Ap horizons.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron oxyhydroxide profiles were used
   to explain the retention of Hg in sediments of natural lakes and flooded
   soils in Quebec. In lake sediments, Hg levels increased from background
   concentrations of approximately 100 ng/g beneath the 10- to 16-cm depth
   interval to 150-490 ng/g near the surface. This increase was attributed
   to atmospheric inputs to the environment. In forest soils, the close
   association of Hg with the surficial organic horizon appears to be a
   potential source of contamination for the aquatic system through the
   transport of particulate matter by surface runoff. High organic matter
   content observed in the flooded soil of LG-2 Reservoir suggests that
   postsedimentation biodegradation is a slow process. In contrast, at
   Cabonga Reservoir, an 80\% reduction in C, N, and Hg concentrations was
   observed between the flooded and the adjacent forest soil. Mechanical
   erosion processes (marling, waves, ice) rather than biodegradation seem
   responsible for the observed loss in C, N, and Hg. We propose that
   suspension of the humic horizon from flooded soils could constitute a
   significant source of Hg contamination to the overlying waters and biota
   until the exposed littoral zone stabilizes.}},

Abstract = {{The C stored in soils is nearly three times that in the aboveground
   biomass and approximately double that in the atmosphere. Reliable
   estimates have been difficult to obtain due to a lack of global data on
   kinds of soils and the amount of C in each soil. With new data bases,
   our study is able to provide more reliable data than previous estimates.
   Globally, 1576 Pg of C is stored in soils, with almost-equal-to 506 Pg
   (32\%) of this in soils of the tropics. It is also estimated that
   almost-equal-to 40\% of the C in soils of the tropics is in forest
   soils. Other studies have shown that deforestation can result in 20 to
   50\% loss of this stored C, largely through erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation tillage on vertisols has not been well accepted, yet
   residue management techniques are needed to control water erosion on
   these highly-erodible soils. Surface soil properties were determined on
   a Houston black clay (Udic Pellusterts) one crop season after chisel
   plow-disk tillage, and after 6 and 10 years in a continuous
   controlled-traffic, no-till management system. Bulk density and
   penetrometer resistance below 50 mm increased with increasing time since
   primary tillage. Soil penetrometer resistance values were not in the
   root restricting range at the soil water contents at time of sampling.
   Stratification of soil nutrients, total nitrogen and phosphorus, and
   soil organic carbon increased with time since primary tillage.
   Conservation tillage appears to be sustainable on these vertisols for an
   extended period of time with the controlled-traffic, no-till practices

Abstract = {{Abundance and distribution of earthworms were studied on the Georgia
   Piedmont of the Southeastern U.S.A., at sites representing various
   ecosystem types, management practices, landscape positions, soil
   textures and soil erosion status. Earthworm abundance showed distinct
   seasonal patterns, with winter/spring maxima and summer minima. Numbers
   and biomass ranged from zero in plowed, mono-cropped soil at an upland
   site to over 1000 m-2 (>25g ash-free dry wt m-2) in no-tillage,
   double-cropped soil on bottomlands. Numbers and biomass in plowed,
   double-cropped soil, in a bottomland forest, and in grass meadows at
   both upland and bottomland sites were intermediate. Soil texture, as
   influenced by water erosion, strongly affected earthworm abundance.
   Moderately and severely eroded sandy clay loam supported significantly
   higher earthworm numbers and biomass than did slightly eroded soil with
   higher sand content. This effect may have resulted from low organic
   content and water holding capacity of the sandy soils. Of the soil
   texture variables, silt content was most highly correlated with
   earthworm biomass. Earthworm abundance was also related to quantity and
   quality of plant residue inputs in the agroecosystems, and to standing
   stocks of soil organic carbon across all sites studied. At most
   agroecosystem and forest sites, the predominant earthworm species were
   European lumbricids; native Diplocardia spp were most prominent in a
   meadow soil with high organic content.}},

   pattern of long-term soil erosion in the Quebec City area. Mean annual
   net soil movements ranging from a deposition of 10.8 t ha-1 yr-1 to a
   loss of 31.8 t ha-1 yr-1 were estimated. The slope steepness and the
   land use significantly influenced the estimated rates of soil movement,
   while soil texture was less important, probably because of the soils'
   sandy texture or the high content of organic carbon, which kept their
   erodibility low. The net soil losses estimated from Cs-137 data were
   consistently higher than those predicted by the USLE. Besides net soil
   losses, it was possible to estimate separately the magnitude of soil
   detachment and soil deposition. Two-thirds of the stations sampled
   experienced net soil loss while the remaining third showed evidence of
   soil accumulation. These data suggest that the small net soil losses
   measured for low erosive conditions (flat slopes, dairy farming) result
   from important soil redeposition rates as much as from small soil
   detachment rates. Cs-137 redistribution data not only produce reliable
   estimates of soil movement rates, but also allow enhanced estimates of
   the agronomic and environmental impacts of soil erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral migration of Amazonian lowland rivers causes a vegetation
   succession on recently deposited fluvial sediments. The forest ground is
   formed gradually in sequence, giving rise to age-zonation of the
   successional stages. Using Landsat MSS maps and field observations, we
   studied variations in fluvial landform evolution and river character.
   The widely used characterizations of the rivers according to their
   suspension-load character and channel pattern were evaluated in relation
   to the vegetation succession. Sequential successional forests appear
   extensively along meandering white-water rivers, which are rich in
   suspended sediments and are characterized by mobile channels.
   Conversely, vegetation zonation is less pronounced at the margins of
   slowly eroding suspension-poor rivers. Line transects were established
   to document meander development along eight different rivers. The
   chemical composition of the recently deposited alluvium differs markedly
   both among rivers and along the transects. Concentrations of organic
   carbon and nitrogen increase toward the meander neck along with the acid
   reaction of the soil. The rate of riverine forest regeneration in
   Peruvian lowland Amazonia was extrapolated on the basis of erosion data
   from four different rivers. and suggests that approximately 130 km2 of
   forest is annually eroded and replaced by successional vegetation, the
   equivalent of 0.2\% of the present floodplain area of this region.}},

Abstract = {{The      pentacyclic       triterpene 17beta(H),21beta(H)-hop-22(29)-ene
   (diploptene) occurs in sediments throughout the Columbia River drainage
   basin and off the southern coast of Washington state in concentrations
   comparable to long-chain plantwax n-alkanes. The same relationship is
   evident for diploptene and long-chain n-alkanes in soils from the
   Willamette Valley. Microorganisms indigenous to soils and soil erosion
   are indicated as the biological source and physical process,
   respectively, for diploptene in coastal sediments. Similarity between
   the stable carbon isotopic composition (deltaC-13(PDB)) of diploptene
   isolated from soil in the Willamette Valley (-31.2+/-0.3 parts per
   thousand) and from sediments deposited throughout the Washington coastal
   environment (-31.2+/-0.5 parts per thousand) supports this argument.
   Values of delta for diploptene in river sediments are variable and 8-179
   parts per thousand lighter, indicating that an additional biological
   source such as methane-oxidizing bacteria makes a significant
   contribution to the diploptene record in river sediments. Selective
   biodegradation resulting from a difference in the physicochemical
   association within eroded particles can explain the absence of the
   more-C-13-depleted form of diploptene in Washington coastal sediments,
   but this mechanism remains unproven.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to compare soil properties of slight, moderate,
   and severe erosion phases and to determine the effect of past erosion on
   corn grain yield. The study was located on Marlette fine sandy loam
   (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic, Glossoboric Hapludalf) near East Lansing,
   Michigan. Solum thickness decreased from 135 cm to 56 cm (53 to 22
   inches) with increasing degrees of erosion. Clay content, bulk density,
   soil pH, and cation exchange capacity of the Ap horizon increased, while
   organic carbon decreased with increasing erosion. Corn yield averages
   for severely eroded plots were 2196 less than those from the slightly
   eroded plots, averaged over the 5-year period. Yield reductions ranged
   from 6\% in 1989 to 4896 in 1988 when May and June were droughty. Corn
   maturity was slightly delayed by increased erosion, Stand counts of
   severely eroded plots were significantly less than those of the slightly
   eroded plots. Yield reductions probably resulted from a soil moisture
   shortage. The severely eroded soils were classified into a different
   subgroup than the slight and moderately eroded soils.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erodibility is influenced by several soil properties including the
   extent to which the clay fraction will disperse in water. Because early
   methods for estimating soil erosion were empirical methods and did not
   utilize water-dispersible clay as a parameter, few data have been
   collected. The recent development of the Water Erosion Prediction
   Project (WEPP) model, a process-based model for predicting water erosion
   that uses water-dispersible clay in the algorithm for computing
   interrill erodibility, resulted in an increased demand for these data.
   In order to accommodate this and similar models, a method for estimating
   the water-dispersible clay content of soils based on existing
   information is needed. Data collected by the National Soil Survey
   Laboratory in support of the WEPP were used to identify soil properties
   that were significantly correlated with water-dispersible clay and to
   develop equations to estimate the water-dispersible clay content of
   soils based on those properties. The property most strongly correlated
   with water-dispersible day is total clay. Other properties significantly
   correlated with water-dispersible clay are the water content at 1.5 MPa,
   dithionite-citrate-extractable Fe and Al, the  coefficient of linear
   extensibility, Wischmeier's M, the very-fine-sand content, the ratio of
   cation-exchange capacity (CEC) to total day, Bouyoucos' clay ratio, and
   the CEC. A simple linear regression of water-dispersible clay vs. total
   clay revealed that, for the soils included in this study, approximately
   one-third of the total clay was water dispersible. However, the model
   only bad an R2 of 0.604. When the ratio of the CEC corrected for organic
   carbon (CCEC) to total clay was included in the model, the R2 improved
   to 0.723. However, sorting the data by the ratio of CCEC to total clay
   instead of including it in the model improved the overall fit of the
   model and increased the R2 to 0.879.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in soil physico-chemical properties as a result of continuous
   cereal cropping for up to 64 years of two southern Queensland Vertisols
   were investigated. The soils were the Waco black earth and the Langlands
   grey clay. For both soils, cultivation increased bulk densities relative
   to those of respective virgin soils, but soil density varied little
   among cultivated sites. The size and strength of dry seedbed aggregates
   decreased owing to cultivation, but remained suitable for wheat
   establishment. The stability of wet aggregates decreased with
   cultivation as indicated by dispersion and slaking measurements. The
   increased dispersion was associated with decreases in hydraulic
   conductivity which may limit infiltration and storage of soil water
   during the summer fallow, thereby reducing crop yields.
   Organic carbon contents decreased with cultivation while exchangeable
   sodium percentage (ESP) and pH values increased. Increased
   dispersibility was correlated with increased sodicity, although ESP
   values remained below accepted critical values. The relationship was
   strongest when both dispersibility and exchangeable sodium were
   expressed on an oven-dry soil basis rather than as the relative
   parameters, dispersion ratio and ESP. Organic carbon content accounted
   for less than 40\% of the temporal variation in aggregate stability.
   The changes in physical and chemical properties with cultivation were
   consistent with exposure of subsurface material following soil erosion
   at rates typical for the region. We concluded that erosion control would
   limit further changes in levels of exchangeable sodium and thus soil
   dispersibility and hydraulic conductivities. The rate of loss of organic
   carbon would also be reduced and soil physical properties and chemical
   fertility would be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Forest floor regeneration after fire in a holm oak forest was studied in
   a chronosequence in Catalonia (NE Spain). The sampled area represented
   situations of high fire disturbance because of the frequency of
   wildfires and the high impact of erosive processes. Forest floor bulk
   samples from the L, F and H layers were taken in 5 burned plots, aging
   from 0 to 35 years. They were analyzed for dry standing weight, and
   organic carbon and N content.
   Plant cover reached almost 100\% two years after the fire. During the
   first 20 years, shrubs and herbs had the highest surface covering, and
   thereafter, holm oaks became dominant.
   Holm oak litterfall stabilized by the fourth year after burning.
   The major shrub species which were present in the chronosequence had two
   different patterns with respect to nitrogen: 1) a low litter C/N ratio
   (i.e. nitrogen fixing species); 2) a high litter C/N ratio.
   The litter decay coefficients were relatively high, allowing for a rapid
   structuration and formation of the L and F layers after the fire.
   Indeed, 95\% of the maximum steady standing weight accumulates in 8-9
   years. The pattern of cover in the different strata influenced the
   lateral distribution and variable accumulation of the forest floor
   layers and determined different turnover rates.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment redistribution within near-level agricultural fields in the
   Gray Wooded soil zone of Saskatchewan was studied using the artificial
   environmental tracer caesium-137 (Cs-137).  The objective of this study
   was to estimate erosion rates caused by wind erosion, and land clearing
   techniques (i.e. bulldozing).  Net rates of erosion and deposition were
   quantified over the past 30 years on three fields.  Wind erosion was
   estimated to be approximately 1.0 t ha-1 y-1 on a near-level field, with
   50 per cent of the sampling sites having erosion rates in excess of soil
   formation.  Bulldozing produced median net sediment flux values of
   between 40 and 90 t ha-1 y-1.  In addition, between 65 and 85 per cent
   of the sampling sites had erosion rates in excess of the maximum
   tolerable limit (i.e. 11.0 t ha-1 y-1).  These results indicate
   significant accelerated erosion results from land clearing techniques
   used in central Saskatchewan.  Bulldozing of the fields removed the
   LFH-horizon and exposed the underlying mineral horizon.  Bulk densitites
   of the 0 to 15 cm layer in the cleared fields were 27 to 55 per cent
   greater than the comparable depth increment within the undisturbed
   forest site.  Organic carbon concentrations within the 1930s, 1979, and
   1987 fields were decreased by 47, 42, and 37 per cent, respectively
   following cultivation and bulldozing.  Decreases in total nitrogen for
   the cultivated fields ranged from 33 to 38 per cent.}},

Abstract = {{Eroded Kandhapludult soils occupy more than 40\% of the Southern
   Piedmont region of the USA. The humid-thermic climate associated with
   the Ultisols permits double crop residue production ranging from 10 to
   14 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Long-term conservation tillage into these crop residues
   is beneficial in ameliorating the effects of soil erosion. During the
   course of a five-year study, decomposition of these residues increased
   soil carbon significantly. Restoration processes were initiated by
   increasing average soil carbon, representing slight, moderate and severe
   soil erosion classes, from 0.97 to 2.37\% in the 0 to 1.5-cm depth.
   Accompanying soil carbon responses were increases in soil N,
   water-stable aggregation and infiltration. Runoff coefficients on
   conservation tilled restored soils was only 6\%, compared to 35\% for
   those conventionally tilled. Rill and interrill soil loss rates were
   also reduced significantly with surface residue provided with
   conservation tillage.
   Restoring Ultisol landscapes with variable levels of soil erosion
   requires differential fertilization. All fertilizer requirements for
   severely eroded plots were 1.43 to 2.30-fold higher than those of
   moderately eroded plots. Because biological N fixation by the crimson
   clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) cover crop appeared to be retarded on
   the severely eroded site, observed plant N stress developed on the
   irrigated/conservation tillage treatment. Cumulative grain yields of
   severely eroded site, ranged from 15.4 to 30.3 Mg ha-1 5 yr-1 and were
   statistically equal to or exceeded those of the slightly eroded site.
   Conservation tillage grain yields were best optimized on the
   rainfed-moderately eroded site, probably because of the more desirable
   texture-organic properties of the 13-cm thick Ap horizon. Management of

Abstract = {{It is now well accepted that riparian forests have an important role in
   regulating upstream/downstream flow of matter and energy in river
   ecosystems. Since geomorphic processes determine the structure of
   channels and floodplains, we have investigated whether different
   geomorphic features of riparian forests had any effects on the ability
   of their soils to retain nutrients and organic carbon. Willow riparian
   forests were chosen within the annual floodplain of the Garonne River,
   southwest France, to represent two different geomorphic types. Erosional
   types of riparian forests (E-type) were characterized by sand deposition
   on their soils because of high current velocity which hampered fine
   particle deposition. Depositional types of riparian forests (D-type)
   were characterized by slower overflow velocity; consequently silt and
   clay were dominant in their soils. Soil samples were taken at the end of
   the vegetation growth period, coinciding with low water levels prior to
   annual floods. Erosion and sedimentation processes affected the
   distribution of total C,N, and P contents in riparian forest soils,
   since they were significantly correlated with soil grain size. D-type
   riparian forest soils act as a sink for upstream/downstream nutrients
   and carbon flows during floods through accumulation of total C,N and P
   from year to year. In contrast, E-type riparian forests act as potential
   nutrient sources during high water periods, since they may release from
   their soils large amounts of easily available C, N and P into the river.
   These results demonstrate that nutrients and carbon retention ability of
   riparian forest soils should be analyzed through their geomorphic
   features rather than by their vegetation composition. Even if they
   belong to the same vegetation succession, riparian forests should not be
   considered as a homogeneous buffering system for upstream/downstream
   flows of nutrients and organic carbon.}},

Abstract = {{The Holocene record of Lake Lugano (southern basin: surface area 20.3
   km2, maximum depth 87 m) comprising organic carbon-rich sediments
   (sapropels), is divided into eight intervals based on radiocarbon- and
   varve-dating. The content of organic carbon, inorganic carbon, and
   biogenic silica, as well as the benthic remains of ostracods and
   oligochaetes, are converted into accumulation rates and benthic
   abundances in order to assess past production rates and bottom water
   oxygen status, respectively. The results suggest three periods of
   distinct palaeolimnological character: (i) low primary production
   combined with shifts between aerobic and anaerobic profundal conditions
   (prior to ca. 3000 BC), (ii) moderate rates of production combined with
   a relatively high profundal oxygen content (after ca. 1500 BC), and
   (iii), high production rates (460 g C m-2 a-1) combined with anaerobic
   profundal conditions (present eutrophic state). Corresponding organic
   carbon contents in the sediments are: up to 5 \% (i), 4 \% (ii), and 8
   \% (iii). Until the beginning of this century, the flux of autochthonous
   sediments to the lake floor correlated with the fluctuations in the
   allochthonous sediment accumulation rate, indicating that catchment
   erosion largely controlled lacustrine production during the Holocene
   history of Lake Lugano. Pollen data show catchment-vegetational
   transformations at ca. 3500 BC (change from fir to beech forests), al
   1400 BC (onset of cereal vegetation) and at ca. A.D. 450 (strong
   increase in various cultural plants). The first two changes had a
   relatively large imprint on lacustrine sedimentation. At ca. 3500 BP,
   erosion increase in the catchment was triggered by vegetation changes in
   the mountain zone above ca. 1000 m a.s.l., which may have been induced
   by climatic and human alteration (drop in the treeline altitude).
   Maximum catchment erosion occurred at ca. 1400 BC which was clearly
   dominated by human cultivation during the Bronze Age. More oxygenated
   profundal conditions in the lake after ca. 3000 BC are possibly related
   to a better mixing of the lake waters during the winter season by
   increased wind activity.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of experimental fire regimes on soil nutrient pool values,
   surface condition status and herbage growth was studied in a
   shrub-invaded woodland on massive red earths near Coolabah, New South
   Wales. Artificial fuel was burnt in spring on plots to achieve intervals
   of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 years between fires.
   No differences between fire regimes were detected below 1 cm for any of
   the measured soil variables. Soil respiration declined linearly with
   increasing number of fires and increasing total fuel load. There were no
   differences or trend for available or total soil nitrogen, organic
   carbon or soil wettability in the 0-1 cm horizon, but relatively
   refractory elements such as P and K, derived from the ash from the
   artificial fuel, built up in the soil proportionately with increased
   fire number and total fuel load.
   The surface condition status of the soil as assessed by a monitoring
   method was strongly inversely related to the number of fires and total
   fuel load. Differences in herbage growth between fire treatments were
   not significant; however, where plots had been burnt five times, herbage
   growth was greater with increased variability (35.8 g m-2, s.e. 19.0)
   compared with unburnt controls (10.7 g m-2, s.e. 1.7). Plots burnt seven
   times annually  had similar means and variance to controls. Low herbage
   yields in control plots were attributed to the high biomass of mature
   shrubs, whilst increasing variability with number of fires was caused by
   the combination of patchy decreased shrub biomass and small-scale
   erosion-deposition cells which differentially distribute seeds across
   the soil surface. Plots burnt annually seven times had deposition beyond
   the plot area.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term tillage trial was conducted (1981 to 1987) on loamy textured
   soils to quantify changes in runoff, soil loss and some soil physical
   properties due to conservation tillage practices. Two sites were
   established, one at Cowra on a sandy loam textured soil, and the other
   at Grenfell on a loamy textured soil. The tillage treatments imposed
   were direct drilling (DD), reduced tillage (RT) and traditional tillage
   (TT), with grazing at both sites, and a direct drilling ungrazed (NT)
   treatment at Cowra only. Runoff and soil loss were measured using a
   rainfall simulator, and sorptivity (S), saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (K(sat)), bulk density to 40 mm (BD4) and 100 mm (BD10), organic carbon
   (OC) and water stable aggregates (WSA) were measured annually.
   Runoff decreased significantly in the minimum soil disturbance
   treatments (NT and DD) at Cowra. Runoff did not decrease in the stubble
   incorporation treatments despite a significant increase in OC and WSA.
   Decreases in runoff were due to the development and maintenance of
   porosity, particularly macropores.
   Changes in other soil physical properties were generally not significant
   owing to temporal variability. The regression relationship between OC
   and WSA, although significant, had little practical value because of
   high prediction error.
   Although improvements in soil physical properties were measured, a
   period of at least five years of cropping at both sites was required
   before they became significant and consistent.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil soils, especially the red soils, (linked with interstadial
   conditions) in the terraces of Mediterranean rivers can be important
   chronoclimatostratigraphic markers.  The lack of organic remains makes
   them generally unsuitable for palaeobiological studies, and thus
   palaeomorphological dating has been the main method applied to determine
   their relative age.  We present the first results of TL dating of fossil
   soils and water-lain sediments from the catchment area of the Turia,
   Jucar and Serpis Rivers in the region of Valencia (Spain).  The
   regeneration method was used to determine the palaeodoses in fine silt
   grains extracted from the bulk samples and Nal(Tl) gamma-spectrometry
   was used for determination of the dose-rates.
   A blind test on a radiocarbon dated 20 ka old sample from the Po Plain
   (Italy) and TL ages for the Eemian palaeolithic site in Cova Negra
   (Valencia, Spain) indicate that the method can give correct results
   within the whole of the Last Glacial/Interglacial period.  The specific
   sedimentation regime interspersed with strong erosional processes in
   Mediterranean valleys (coarse-grain and stony sediments, frequent
   erosional contacts) are not very favourable for TL dating or
   interpretation of the results.  Also post-sedimentation changes (e.g.
   carbonate leaching and accumulation inside the dated horizon) could
   affect the dose-rate and consequently the TL age.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative methods of
   estimating the postsettlement soil erosion from hillslopes in a small
   watershed in Bureau County, northwestern Illinois. Methods used include:
   (i) estimation of the soil erosion using total organic C balance or
   enrichment ratio, (ii) selected soil property comparisons between the
   cultivated, sloping, and eroded soils of the watershed and uncultivated,
   sloping, and uneroded reference soils of the same taxa occurring in the
   area cemeteries, and (iii) Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE).
   Previously measured sediment remaining in the sediment basin and
   calculated sediment delivery were used as the bases for evaluating the
   effectiveness of proposed methods to estimate soil erosion from the
   surrounding hillslopes. Differences in thickness of the A horizon
   consistently underestimated soil erosion by 64\% relative to the
   estimates made by the total sediment remaining in basin and delivered to
   the stream. This suggests erosion classes which are based on erosion of
   topsoil underestimate the extent of erosion from both the topsoil and
   subsoil, particularly where soils have been severely truncated. Organic
   C redistribution was highly correlated to sediment delivery method and
   appear to be related directly to the quantity of soil eroded and could
   provide an alternative to A horizon thickness differences as a basis for
   quantifying soil erosion. The soil erosion estimated by the USLE was
   80\% of the soil erosion estimated by the sediment delivery method. This
   difference can be accounted for by the fact that the sediment delivery
   method assumed all the sediment came from the sideslopes and USLE is not
   designed to include erosion resulting from concentrated overland flow
   (gully erosion). The comparison between cultivated and uncultivated
   sites of the depth to carbonates and the lowest part of the Bt horizon
   containing 27\% clay between eroded and uneroded phases of Tama soils
   each produced an estimate of soil erosion within 17\% of the soil
   erosion estimated hy sediment delivery method and could be used to
   estimate soil erosion.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of Cs-137 activity in soils provides a means of
   assessing physical transport of soil particles.  We measured the
   activity of Cs-137 along cracks and within peds of a Chromic Pelloxerert
   on the flood plain of an ephemeral stream in the Central Valley of
   California to assess the role of pedoturbation in the formation of a
   Vertisol.  The Cs-137 activity is highest in the upper 10 cm of the soil
   and generally decreases with increasing depth, although Cs-137 activity
   is also high locally along cracks and at the bottom of some cracks near
   the average depth of cracking (base of Bss horizon, 72-cm depth). 
   Laterally (along cracks vs. ped interiors), the Cs-137 activity varies
   greatly and shows no consistent pattern.  Micromorphological evidence of
   stress-oriented clay in soil fabric and locally high Cs-137 activity
   below 72 cm indicate incorporation of surface materials into deeper
   cracks during drierthan-average years.  Organic carbon (OC) content
   decreases regularly with depth, whereas CaCO3 content is uniform
   throughout the upper 72 cm.  The nonhomogeneous Cs-137 distribution
   demonstrates that pedoturbation has occurred.  The rate of
   homogenization of soil material in the upper 72 cm exceeds 25 yr and is
   slower than the rate of OC accumulation and humification, but faster
   than the rate of carbonate redistribution.  We attribute relatively high
   Cs-137 activity throughout the upper 20 to 30 cm of the soil to
   incorporation of surface material into minor cracks that open during the
   dry season.  The incorporation of sloughed materials at the base of
   larger cracks, where evidence of shearing (slickensides) is most
   strongly developed, is only locally significant and is probably not the
   dominant mechanism of pedoturbation.}},

Abstract = {{A major cause of soil productivity loss through erosion is attributed to
   changes in soil water-holding properties or a reduction in thickness of
   the plant rooting zone.  The objective of this study was to measure the
   effect of management-induced changes in soil organic carbon (OC)
   concentration on soil characteristics affecting the available water
   capacity.  Four sites each of moderately coarse (sandy), medium, and
   moderately fine or fine (fine) soils were sampled in four increments to
   0.457 m within each of two cropland management systems (conventionally
   cultivated and stubble mulched) and each of two virgin grassland
   management systems (grazed virgin and relict virgin).  Measurements of
   the water concentration by weight (P(w)) at field capacity (FC) and
   permanent wilting point (PWP) were made on disturbed soil samples.  Bulk
   density decreased with increasing OC concentration.  The magnitude of
   change was greatest in sandy and least in the medium-textured soils. 
   For all soils combined, a change in sand fraction accounted for about
   75\% of the change in P(w) at both the FC and the PWP.  The change in
   P(w) was greater at FC than the PWP.  A unit change in OC concentration
   in the sandy soils caused a greater change in P(w) at FC than at the
   PWP, but in the medium and fine soils the change in P(w) at FC
   essentially paralleled the change at the PWP.  An increase in OC
   concentration did not change the available water capacity in the sandy
   group and decreased it in the medium and fine textural groups.  Loss of
   soil productivity induced by erosion in the northern Great Plains is
   probably more closely associated with a decline in nutrients and
   biological activity than from a change in available water capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The Middle to Late Eocene Chumstick Formation comprises > 12 km of
   fluvial and lacustrine strata deposited in a strike-slip basin in
   Washington State. The Chumstick paleoflora is a mixed suite of
   broad-leaved evergreen and broad-leaved deciduous taxa, with
   physiognomic characteristics intermediate between paratropical and
   subtropical rainforest types. The Chumstick paleoflora probably occupied
   an intermediate paleogeographic position between lowland and montane
   rainforest, in a setting about 150 km inland from the Pacific coast at
   elevations up to about 750 m.
   Most plant macrofossils are found in proximal overbank sequences or on
   the preserved tops of emergent mid-channel bars. Certain taxa are more
   typical of floodplain versus channel-margin sites. Key differences were
   also noted between ``upland{''} (proximal to fault scarps) and
   ``lowland{''} taxa, which may be related to soil drainage. Chumstick
   paleosols include entisols (poor horizonal development), inceptisols
   (incipient Cca or K horizon development) and histosols (histic epipedons
   containing up to 6\% total organic carbon).
   Paleovegetation had a significant effect on fluvial deposition in the
   Chumstick Formation. Even in coarse-grained, fault-proximal facies there
   is evidence for bank cohesion and stability, bank undercutting and
   failure, soil erosion, and overbank deposits. The dominance of vertical
   accretion over lateral channel migration in more distal deposits can be
   attributed to rapid subsidence, coupled with bank stability imparted by
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Arenites contain several types of non-carbonate intrabasinal (NCI)
   grains which are seldom given specific attention in petrographic
   studies.  However, recognition and analysis of these particles may be of
   invaluable help for stratigraphic, paleogeographic and even metamorphic
   reconstructions.
   Rip-up clasts are the most common NCI grains in various depositional
   environments.  Concentration of other NCI types, such as green peloids,
   ferruginous ooids, reworked phosphates, chert, soil fragments, black
   pebbles or pyrite clasts, occurs at times of reduced sedimentation
   rates.  During major transgressions, a wealth of iron, phosphorus,
   silica and organic matter of both terrestrial and marine origin is
   provided by rapid flooding of coastal plains, erosion of tropical soils
   developed during previous lowstand stages, and plankton blooms in
   nutrient-rich waters.  Prolonged periods of starved detrital supply
   foster authigenesis and formation of sediments rich in iron, phosphorus
   and silica in shallow encroaching seas.  Eventually, a variety of NCI
   grains from terrestrial, paralic and marine sources are reworked during
   stepwise coastal retreat and left as lags on ravinement surfaces or
   deposited in accreting sandwaves by storm or tidal currents.  On passive
   margins, NCI-rich arenite intervals are typically found in the basal
   transgressive tract of depositional supersequences, when a rapid
   short-term eustatic rise is superimposed on regional thermo-tectonic
   subsidence associated with waning rift volcanism, break-up and
   reorganization of plate motion.  Ironstone deposition is also favored by
   global ``polytaxic{''} conditions and expanded oxygen-minimum layer in
   the oceans.  Various types of NCI grains are also found in active
   margins and foreland basins, where they are generally diluted due to
   higher sedimentation rates.
   Other NCI grains, including plant debris, siliceous tests, clastic
   gypsum and even rarer particles may occur as framework components in
   arenites.}},

Abstract = {{Better assessment of large scale patterns in soil fertility, erosion,
   and crop productivity is needed to address environmental concerns in the
   steeply rolling dryland farming region of eastern Washington.  Spatial
   variability of organic carbon, soil phosphorus, and wheat yields
   measured on several 655 m long transects in complex eroded hills of the
   Palouse region of eastern Washington was studied using classical
   statistics and geostatistics.  In addition, Landsat Thematic Mapper
   images of bare soil at the study site were used to estimate organic
   matter content in blocks having an area of 28.5 m x 28.5 m.  Classical
   statistical analysis showed moderate coefficients of variation in soil
   properties (25-50\%) and wheat yields (30\%).  Spherical semivariograms
   of soil properties and wheat yields showed strong spatial dependence,
   with a range of influence on the order of from 70 m to 145 m.  The
   semivariogram for Landsat estimated organic matter was almost identical
   to that for organic matter measured in the surface transects.  The
   cross-semivariogram between measured organic matter and wheat yields
   also exhibited strong spatial dependence, with a range of influence of
   about 120 m.  Organic matter, soil phosphorus, and wheat yield were
   interpolated at unsampled locations using block kriging and block
   cokriging techniques.  Excellent agreement was obtained between kriged
   wheat yields and wheat yields cokriged from Thematic Mapper estimates of
   organic matter.  Satisfactory agreement was obtained between kriged soil
   phosphorus and cokriged soil phosphorus based upon remotely sensed
   organic matter.  Results of this study provided strong evidence for
   nonrandom spatial patterns in soil properties and crop yields.  These
   spatial patterns are associated with changes in surface organic matter
   content across the landscape resulting from extensive erosion and
   exposure of subsoil.  Geostatistical techniques provide a powerful tool
   for interpolating ground measurements of soil properties and crop yield
   over large areas in combination with estimates of organic matter
   obtained from Thematic Mapper images.}},

Abstract = {{Four forested, well drained surface horizons of soils representing the
   range of textures located in the Lake Erie Basin of Southern Ontario
   were sampled in 1 cm increments to a depth of 15 cm.  Gamma emitting
   radionuclides of natural sources, K-40, Bi-214 (U-238 daughter), and
   Tl-208 (Th-232 daughter0, are distributed as a function of texture over
   the 15 cm depth.  Increasing clay content results in increased retention
   of these isotopes.  The K-40 distribution is a result of the amount of
   organic carbon present.  Increased organic carbon results in increased
   weathering and lower K-40 values.  Differing earthworm activity results
   in distinct distributions of Cs-137, a gamma emitting radionuclide from
   bomb fallout, within the four soils.  Larger numbers and biomass of
   anecic earthworms in finer textured soils result in a linear
   distribution of Cs-137 with depth.  Endogeous species in the coarsest
   textured soil result in little incorporation of Cs-137 with depth.}},

Abstract = {{Three Aridisols, one Mollisol and one Entisol of a topographic sequence
   (catena) on calcareous materials of alluvial/colluvial fans on the

   were examined.  Detailed profile descriptions and laboratory studies
   included particle size distribution, pH, specific conductance, soil
   carbonate fractions, organic C, total N, and plant-available and
   water-soluble nutrients.  During the youngest phase of morphodynamic
   stability, in which erosion processes were diminished, soils were formed
   from more or less eroded remnants of the fan sediments into extremely
   calcareous, very shallow to deep, brown, and poorly weathered soils with
   a loamy to extremely gravelly texture.  The availability of nutrients
   was moderate for N, Cu, to very low for P, Fe, Zn.  Only K and Mn showed
   adequate values.  The sodium saturation of subsoils was also very low
   ion spite of the proximity of saline soils.  Because of the unfavorable
   physical and chemical characteristics, the potential soil fertility is
   poor.  Therefore, any use of these soils would only be possible by
   extensive grazing management or cultivation of technical-use crops like
   Agave spp., Aloe vera L., Dasylirion longissimum Lem., Larrea tridentata
   (DC) Cov., Opuntia spp., Simmondsia chinensis Link, and Yucca spp.
   adapted to dry conditions.  Irrigated agriculture could also be carried
   out successfully on loamy riparian soils with low pebble content in the
   basin of sporadic water-bearing wadis or arroyos.}},

Abstract = {{This study was initiated to determine the basic characteristics and
   genesis of soils on gentle to very steep slopes on two contrasting slope
   aspects.  Two transects, a southwest (SW) and a northwest (NW) transect,
   were laid out on a sandstone ridge across the summit and steepest convex
   shoulder positions.  The thickness of the O, A and E horizons was not
   related to slope gradient across soils on all slope gradients and
   aspects.  This indicates that the present rate of soil formation is
   greater than erosion, the influence of erosion on steep slopes could be
   off-set by lateral movement of through-flow water above the B horizon,
   or the process of tree throw masks slope gradient effects.  Solum depth,
   B horizon thickness, clay, Fe, and Al indexes decreased with increasing
   slope for both the NW and SW aspects.  Organic carbon index decreased
   with increasing slope for the SW aspect.  Decreases in effective
   precipitation over relatively larger surface areas at steep versus lower
   slope gradients, a longer influence of periglacial erosion following the
   Wisconsinan glacial advance, and present slow but significant soil creep
   could cause these differences in soil development across the slope. 
   Solum depth, B horizon thickness, clay, Fe, and Al indexes showed a
   smaller decrease across the NW compared to the SW slope.  Organic carbon
   did not decrease across the NW slope.  The E horizon was also slightly
   thicker on the NW compared to the SW slope.  These aspect differences
   were probably caused by less evaporation on ``shaded{''} NW compared to
   ``sunny{''} SW slopes which produce generally higher moisture levels and
   more effective eluviation and illuviation on the NW slope.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews current knowledge on the range and extent of various
   tillage systems used in North America with special reference to the
   effects on soil properties, the erosion hazard and water quality.  The
   increasing adoption of conservation-tillage systems since their
   introduction in the early 1960s follows an enhanced awareness of the
   increasing risks of soil erosion and non-point source pollution and the
   high cost of fuel with conventional tillage.  Most ``conventional
   tillage{''} systems encompass complete inversion tillage along with
   several secondary and tertiary tillage methods.  In contrast,
   conservation-tillage systems involve streamlining various farm
   operations, thereby reducing the frequency and intensity of the soil
   manipulative operations.  Reduction in tillage intensity has been
   accompanied by the development of rotations and cropping systems,
   methods of surface and internal drainage, fertilizer technology and pest
   management alternatives.
   The status of antecedent soil physical properties is an important factor
   affecting the choice of tillage systems.  Important soil physical
   properties governing the choice of tillage systems include soil wetness
   and anaerobiosis, soil temperature and soil structure including its
   susceptibility to compaction, crusting or erosion.  Tillage systems
   affect soil physical, chemical and biological properties.  Among drastic
   tillage-induced changes in soil properties are bulk density,
   infiltration rate, aggregation and aggregate size distribution, soil
   organic carbon and nutrient profile, microbial activity and species
   diversity, and the population of earthworms.  Macropores and biochannels
   are usually more prevalent in conservation-tillage than
   conventional-tillage systems.  Conservation tillage induces
   stratification of soil organic matter and related nutrients, enhances
   the activity of soil fauna and leads to acidification.  The magnitude of
   these changes depends on the soil type, the cropping systems and the
   type of conservation tillage adopted.  Soil organic carbon and nutrient
   stratification are generally more pronounced in coarse-textures than in
   clayey soils.  Conservation tillage is also associated with greater
   biomass pool size.  The latter affects the nutrient response curves of
   the soil.  Nitrification and denitrification are other important
   processes affected by tillage systems.
   The widespread adaption of conservation-tillage systems, although
   beneficial in controlling off-site sedimentation, has raised concerns
   about the potential for increased leaching of nutrients and pesticides
   to groundwater.  Important pollutants associated with conservation
   tillage are nitrate and pesticides.  Some studies have shown little
   effect of tillage on losses of pesticides.  Conservation tillage may
   suppress crop yields, especially on heavy textured soil with poor
   internal drainage and in those prone to soil compaction caused by
   vehicular traffic.}},

   estimated from the depths of Ap horizons.  Soil loss was closely related
   to slope position and land use.  Contents of OC, N(t), and P(a) were
   reduced by soil loss.  They were not restored at the medium- and

Abstract = {{Aggregate stability is a measure of the ability of soil to withstand the
   disrupting forces of rain and nonsymmetrical wetting.  Erosion may
   influence aggregate stability by exposing soil with properties different
   than the original soil surface.  This study was conducted to determine: 
   (i) the influence of antecedent soil water content on wet aggregate
   stability using aggregates prehumidified to near saturation; (ii) the
   effects of organic C and clay content on the soil water
   content-aggregate stability relationship; and (iii) the effect of
   topsoil removal on aggregate stability.  Seventy-eight soil samples were
   taken from six profiles of Beadle clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic,
   mesic, Typic Argiustoll).  These samples were analyzed for pH, organic
   C, texture, CaCO3, antecedent soil water content, cation-exchange
   capacity (CEC), and aggregate stability.  Isolated test plots were also
   saturated with an overhead sprinkling infiltrometer.  Samples were taken
   periodically throughout a 4-d period for aggregate-stability
   determination.  A modified wet sieving technique, which included
   prehumidifying of the sample to near saturation, was used to determine
   aggregate stability.  A negative linear relationship was found between
   aggregate stability of prehumidified aggregates and antecedent soil
   water content.  Prediction equations were developed that explain up to
   77\% of variability for the aggregate stability.  Organic C was the most
   important of the independent variables, followed by antecedent soil
   water content in the multiple regression analysis.  Topsoil removal by
   desurfacing and erosion reduced aggregate stability.  Aggregate
   stabilities for soils with high organic C and clay content were less
   affected by antecedent soil water content.}},

Abstract = {{Shrubland vegetation and environmental data in western Shewa, Ethiopia
   have been analysed.  Vegetation data include cover-abundance values of
   vascular plant species; environmental data comprise physical and
   chemical properties of the soil, altitude, slope, grazing and browsing
   pressure.
   The vegetation data were subjected to hierarchical and non-hierarchical
   classification and ordination with correspondence analysis.  The
   classification resulted in seven different vegetation types, ranging
   from grassland with scattered shrubs to degenerated forest.  Ordination
   of the data and biplot analysis showed that the vegetation is influenced
   by anthropogenic factors and altitudinal variation.  Sand content is
   related to a low level of anthropogenic influence whereas silt content
   is related to a high level.  This is explained by historical events
   rather than by the present situation.  Total nitrogen, organic carbon,
   altitude and slope are positively correlated and these variables are
   negatively related to anthropogenic influences.
   The shrubland vegetation may have expanded from lower altitudes and
   drier sites as forests gradually disappeared.
   The recovery of an economically more rewarding vegetation type may be
   achieved through providing alternative sources of fuel and construction
   and through prohibiting cultivation and grazing in the shrublands on the
   hillsides.  Regeneration can be accelerated by actively introducing
   seedlings of tree species that do not need a heavy canopy cover for
   establishment and growth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper does not describe the future course of soil science in the
   tropics.  Rather, it is concerned with some soil-related issues that
   tropical countries will have to face, and resolve, in the short and
   medium term.  The topics chosen for discussion here are deforestation,
   the resultant degradation of the soil resource, and soil management for
   continuous crop production, with particular reference to the humid
   tropics.
   Tropical forests are being lost at a rate of at least 10 million
   hectares per annum, most of which occurs through conversion to
   agriculture.  The removal of a vegetative cover, depletion of soil
   nutrients and organic matter, and accelerated erosion have led to
   drastic declines in soil productivity.  The tropical uplands, into which
   future expansion of the cultivated area should largely occur, are
   particularly vulnerable to erosion once their forest cover has been
   removed.  In releasing about a quarter of the global CO2 emission to the
   atmosphere, the large-scale clearing of tropical forests also
   contributes significantly to the ``greenhouse effect{''}.  Another
   consequence of forest destruction, especially of tropical rainforests,
   is the loss of biological diversity.
   Soil management for sustainable land use is discussed in the context of
   various cultivation systems.  Shifting cultivation is a stable but
   extensive system of land use, providing for the subsistence of only a
   few people per unit area of forested land.  Because of rising
   populations and expectations, this traditional farming system is being
   increasingly supplanted by more permanent and intensive methods of
   cultivation.  Nevertheless, by leaving the litter and undergrowth intact
   during land clearing operations and practicing appropriate post-clearing
   soil management, continuous cropping could be sustained in lowland areas
   with relatively deep soils.  In the uplands, however, where the soils
   are often shallow and easily erodible, agro-forestry appears to be a
   better alternative in terms of soil conservation.
   The development and implementation of sustainable farming systems in
   order to arrest, if not reverse, soil degradation must rest on the
   willing cooperation of the people involved.  Soil conservation programs
   should not only be acceptable to, but also be compatible with the
   socio-economic aspirations and conditions of the local community.}},

Abstract = {{Two soils derived from glacial deposits and one from alluvium were
   examined for changes in organic matter (OM) and nitrogen levels between
   1943 and 1983 across the international boundary in the Fraser Lowland of
   western North America.  Duplicate samples were collected from the upper
   0.2 m from 60 randomly selected sites on the five land clearing periods
   (1943-1955, 1955-1966, 1966-1976, 1976-1983, uncleared) on each of three
   parent materials: glacial outwash, alluvium, and glacialmarine deposits
   in the United States and Canada.  The land clearing periods were
   determined from medium scale aerial photographs taken in 1943, 1955,
   1966, 1976, and 1983.  Cultivation results in a 20\% loss of OM after 35
   yr on all soils.  The largest loss is in the first 15 yr on all soils. 
   Changes in N levels on the three parent materials is irregular.  C:N
   narrows on all soils from about 15:1 to about 12:1.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall modifies random roughness (RR) at varying rates for different
   soils.  Methods to estimate RR decay are needed for computer models
   which simulate physical processes occurring at or near the soil surface.
   The objective of this study was to estimate RR decay curves as a
   function of soil properties.  Surface roughness has been reported for
   selected soils before and after simulated rainfall (5 to 80 mm on five
   soils, 35 to 300 mm on one soil) and before and after natural rainfall
   (7 to 350 mm on two soils).  The soils represent a wide range of
   textural and physical properties.  A modified exponential function was
   fit to normalized RR values (RR after rainfall/initial RR) using
   rainfall amount as an independent variable.  The coefficients of this
   function were then approximated as a function of two soil properties: 
   percentage organic carbon and percentage clay.  Surface stability
   increased with greater amounts of organic carbon.  Surface stability
   increased with clay content to about 31\% and then decreased with
   greater amounts of clay.  Random roughness decay curves may be estimated
   for specific soils by using the exponential function.}},

Abstract = {{Organic geochemical studies of 12 soil samples from Wright and Taylor
   Valleys of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) in southern Victoria
   Land, Antarctica, were carried out.  Long-chain n-alkanois acids
   (C20-C34), with a predominance of even-carbon numbers, were abundant in
   all the samples.  3-Hydroxy acids (C-8-C30) with a predominance of
   even-carbon numbers were found in the samples, together with 2-, omega-
   and (omega-1)-hydroxy acids.  alpha,omega-Dicarboxylic acids (C-8-C31)
   were detected having near-unity values of carbon preference indices;
   mainly the C-13 dicarboxylic acid predominated.  Visual kerogen revealed
   that amorphous materials are major components (68-98\%) with small
   amounts of very fine coals (2-32\%), but no woody and herbaceous
   materials.  The occurrence of mature isomers of steranes and
   triterpanes, the paucity of n-alkenoic acids and data from the
   microscopic study suggest that organic components in the soil samples
   are derived from erosion of Beacon Supergroup sedimentary rocks and past
   biological debris containing vascular plant waxes as well as
   wind-transported cyanobacterial mats, including cyanobacteria,
   microalgae, bacteria and fungi, rather than from living organisms.}},
