AB Landscape processes may impact the amount of carbon (C) required to maintain soil organic C levels. The objective of this study determined the influence of elevation zones on soil organic C maintenance and C-budgets. Research conducted between 1995 and 2003 in a 16o ac (65 ha) east-central South Dakota field measured spatial and temporal biomass [corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max)] production and changes in soil organic C and C-13 isotopic discrimination (A). Results from this study showed that: 1) data collected through precision farming practices (yield and grid soil samples analyzed for soil organic Q can be used to determine soil organic C maintenance requirements; 2) the corn - soybean rotation may not return enough biomass-C to maintain soil organic C levels at all landscape positions; 3) calculated maintenance rates were dependent on the approach used to estimate below ground biomass; 4) footslope areas had higher maintenance rates than summit/shoulder areas; and 5) 1.84 percent and 1.21 percent soil organic C measure in 1995 (SOC95) were mineralized annually in elevation zones less than 527.3 and greater than 527.3 m, respectively. To maintain soil organic C levels, areas where mineralization is high (footslopes) will require higher biomass-C additions than areas where soil organic C mineralization is low (shoulders). The potential benefits of increasing biomass-C additions to footslope areas at the expense of summit/shoulder areas must be balanced against the potential effects on erosion.

AB Intensive tillage moves large quantities of soil, resulting in a pattern of soil redistribution where topsoil is depleted from convex slope positions and deposited in concave positions. In these experiments, the variation in erosion estimates, properties of the surface soil, and crop yield (four years) were determined in an undulating landscape that is subject to annual moldboard plowing. Results indicated that areas with high tillage erosion (shoulder slope positions) had high inorganic carbon contents in the surface soil due to the incorporation of calcareous subsoil material. Wheat yields in 2000, 2001, and 2003 were lowest in these areas, demonstrating yield reductions Of 50 percent or more. Conversely, wheat yields were highest in areas in which soil translocation by tillage and water results in a net deposition of soil (depressions). These areas had a deeper A horizon, and the surface soils had higher organic carbon contents, lower pH and lower inorganic carbon contents. Soybean yields in 2002 did not show a strong dependence on location within the landscape. These results indicate that the observed variation in crop yield in undulating landscapes may be significantly influenced by removal of topsoil through repeated intensive tillage, and point to opportunities for landscape restoration to reduce yield losses.

DE fertility gradient; yield variation on soil and water conservation

AB Terrace benches on the hillslopes of Western Uganda exhibit a crop-yield gradient: upper portions of terraces produce less than the lower sections. We investigated the soil factors responsible for this yield variation on 30 terraces along 5 toposequences in what was predominantly a Ferralsol. Two levels of spatial analysis were conducted: (1) variation within individual terraces; and (2) differences across hill-slope positions. A greenhouse experiment further examined this fertility gradient using soils extracted from the upper, middle and lower parts of the terrace. This included a nitrogen (N) treatment of 70 mg N kg(-1) soil. In the fields sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) grain yield differed significantly (p:<= 0.05) across terraces, increasing from 0.4 Mg ha(-1) on the upper 40 per cent of terrace to 2.5 Mg ha(-1) on the lower 40 per cent. Soil bulk density decreased down the terraces from 1.41 g cm(-3) to 1.18 g cm(-3), causing an increase of hydraulic conductivity from 1.6 cm h(-1) to 7.3 cm h(-1), from the upper to the lower part, respectively. Organic carbon (C) and total N increased from upper to lower terrace sections. In the greenhouse, sorghum growing on soils from which the soil physical limitations have been removed did not show significant yield differences across a terrace as observed in the field. Response to N was most pronounced on the upper terrace sections, increasing sorghum dry matter from 3 g pot(-1) to 15 g pot(-1). On the lower terrace, N amendment increased dry matter from 4 g pot(-1) to 11g pot(-1) Technologies to improve the adverse soil physical conditions and the N limitations on upper terrace parts while preventing tillage- and soil-erosion-induced terrace scouring are required.

AB Productivity in subsistence or low-input agriculture depends on the release of nutrients through mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). For this reason, SOM quantity and quality are two important variables related to the sustainability of subsistence family farming. The objective of this work was to study the interrelationships among soil use, texture and relief, at basin scale, on the concentration of total soil C (Ct) and N (Nt), the oxidizable C fraction with 16.5 mol L-1 KMnO4 (Cox) and the amino-sugars fraction off (Namino). These properties were quantified in 260 single soil samples (0-20 cm layer) from the Vaca Brava basin, Paraiba State, Brazil. The region was sampled using a stratified sampling design with an incomplete factorial arrangement of the strata in areas under subsistence farming. Concentrations of Ct, Nt and Namino decreased in the following order: pasture > fodder > crops. In relation to the relief Ct, Nt and their fractions were greater in lowlands and smaller in foot-hill areas. The latter tended to accumulate sand, while lowlands showed greater accumulation of silt. Sediment redistribution was caused mainly by erosion processes of the back-slope regions, in which finer textures predominated. In relation to textural classes, SOM concentrations and their fractions were greater(p < 0.05) in clayey sand samples and smaller in sandy loam ones. In all strata, Cox and Namino concentrations tended to parallel the variations in Ct and Nt. For this reason, Cox/Ct and Nt/Namino ratios that could be used as SOM quality index varied very little as a function of use, relief or texture.

AB The chemical forms, spatial distribution and sources of As, Hg, Cd, Pb and Zn in sediments of the Miyun reservoir were studied. The results of sequential extraction demonstrate that most of As, Pb and Zn were bound to the residual fraction, Hg was associated with the sulfide fraction while Cd was associated with the carbonate fraction and the residual fraction. On the vertical profiles the concentrations of the heavy metals in total and each fractions mostly decreased with increasing depths in sediments, suggesting that the heavy metals input from the upstream watershed increases yearly. Summation of the residual fraction, the sulfide fraction and the carbonate fraction accounts for 60.03%-85.60% of the total heavy metal contents in the sediments, which represent the geochemical background values of the elements and relate closely to soil erosion. Results of the main factor analysis show that most sediments of the reservoir come from the upstream soil erosion, the point source pollution and domestic waste. Moreover, the microbial activities taking place on the sediment-water interface are also one of the major factors to cause the increasing content of the organic matter fraction and the iron-manganese oxide fraction. Environmental change of the reservoir water could make the removability of the heavy metals increase, leading to the increase of their concentrations in pore water in sediments, and imperiling water quality of the reservoir.

AB Soil tillage influences water erosion, and consequently, losses of calcium, magnesium and organic carbon in surface runoff. Nutrients and organic carbon are transported by surface runoff in particulate form, adsorbed to soil colloids or soluble in water, depending on the soil tillage system. This study was carried out on an Inceptisol, representative of the Santa Catarina highlands, southern Brazil, between November 1999 and October 2001, under natural rainfall. The soil tillage treatments (no replications) were: no-tillage (NT), minimum soil tillage with chiseling + disking (NIT), and conventional soil tillage with plowing + two diskings (CT). The crop cycles sequence was soybean (Glycine max), oats (Avena saliva), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and vetch (Vicia sativa). Conventional soil tillage treatment with plowing + two disking in the absence of crops (BS) was also studied. Calcium and magnesium concentrations were determined in both water and sediments of the surface runoff, while organic carbon was measured only in sediments. Calcium and magnesium concentrations were greater in sediments than in surface runoff, while total losses of these elements were greater in surface runoff than in sediments. The greatest calcium and magnesium concentrations in surface runoff were obtained under CT, while in sediments the greatest concentration occurred under MT. Organic carbon concentration in sediments did not differ under the different soil tillage systems, and the greatest total loss was under CT system.

AB [ 1] This study quantified the soil and carbon fluxes caused by water erosion within the sloping uplands of the Mekong River basin, a river system carrying one of the greatest worldwide amounts of sediment to the ocean. Losses of sediment and soil organic carbon (SOC) ( including black carbon, BC) were evaluated within an agricultural catchment of 62 ha with steep slopes, on a tributary of the Mekong river, at nested scales of micro-plot ( 1 m 2), micro-catchment (0.6 ha) and catchment ( 62 ha), in an attempt to explain the processes involved in water erosion. In 2002, carbon erosion occurred during 35 rainfall events amounting to 1023 mm of an annual total of 1651 mm. Water erosion removed annually 14.1 t ha(-1) of sediment and 0.69 t ha(-1) of SOC from the study site. This is equivalent to 7.75 and 0.51 Pg yr(-1), respectively, for the uplands of the Mekong basin as a whole. When compared to the bulk soil, the eroded soil material was enriched in SOC and BC by factors of 2.3 and 1.4, respectively. The annual yields of soil material from the micro- catchment were 3 times lower for sediment and 6 times lower for SOC than those from the micro- plots. From the micro- plots to the catchment, the yields decreased by a factor of 25 for sediment and 59 for SOC. Although a considerable amount of soil material is detached from its original site by water erosion, most of this material is redistributed within the landscapes, being deposited in places acting as sinks, such as hillslopes, and valley bottoms where BC is preferentially deposited. The loads from the catchment of 0.56 t ha(-1) yr(-1) for sediment and 0.016 t ha(-1) yr(-1) for SOC were considerable, corresponding to 0.31 Pg of sediment and 0.01 Pg of SOC for the Mekong basin uplands as a whole. These results on the selective water erosion of soil material, SOC and BC on sloping lands of Southeast Asia allow the source and sink functions of the sloping lands of tropical landscapes to be better understood.

AB We studied the impact of direct seeding mulch-based cropping systems (DMC) on soil characteristics and maize production compared with conventional tillage management (CT) in the semi-arid region of western Mexico. Mulch treatments included 0, 1.5, 3 and 4.5 Mg ha(-1) of added surface crop residues. The study was carried out from 1994 to 1998 on a Dystric Cambisol soil in La Tinaja in the state of Jalisco. Water runoff, soil erosion, soil C changes, maize aboveground biomass and grain yield were monitored on field plots. The results show that mulch treatments reduced annual water runoff losses by 10 to 50% relative to the conventional tillage treatment depending on residue amounts, slope and year. Soil erosion losses were reduced by 50 to 90%. Over a 5-year period soil carbon levels under mulch increased by 23 to 29% compared with conventional tillage, mainly due to increased crop residue inputs and reduced soil carbon erosion under mulch treatment. In the year with the most intense rainfall (1997), the conventional treatment lost about 800 kg of C ha(-1) i.e. 2 to 7 times greater than mulch treatments. Maize grain yields were greater by 170 to 190% under mulch. Yield increases under mulch occurred each year, notably due to improved water and nutrient use efficiency. Potential yield benefits under mulch in the longer term due to build-up of soil organic matter and reduction of soil erosion were not obvious in our experiment. Overall, even small amounts of surface residue are effective at sustaining rainfed maize productivity under the semi-arid conditions of western Mexico. The short-term yield benefits are a promising factor for adoption of direct seeding mulch-based systems in the region.

AB Soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) are lost from hillslopes in particulate forms through soil erosion. The fate of the eroded C (e.g., sequestration or oxidation) may affect the global C budget, and delivery of N and P to waterbodies can lead to eutrophication. Whereas the magnitude of particulate nutrient losses may be similar to or greater than dissolved losses, it is rarely estimated. We couple a sediment delivery model with measurements of C, N, and P in soil to account explicitly for hillslope sediment transport processes that yield sediment-bound nutrients to fluvial networks. The model is applied to a site in California dominated by coastal sage scrub and gopher-rich grasslands. Although the magnitude of sediment delivery predicted by the model has been tested with reservoir sedimentation records, no data exist to test the predicted rates of nutrient delivery. Nevertheless, the model results are provocative; it predicts that losses of particulate C from sage covered hillslopes (23 kg/ha/yr) are nearly double that from grassland hillslopes (13 kg/ha/yr), despite a lower annual sediment yield from the sage hillslopes. The model predicts similar average annual N and P losses for sage and grasslands but dramatic differences in the frequency and magnitude of delivery events. Nutrient delivery from grasslands is chronic whereas delivery from the coastal sage is highly episodic, with large pulses driven by fire frequency. These results suggest that changes in the vegetation community can alter the delivery regime of sediment-bound C, N, and P.

AB Sustainable agriculture requires the formation of new humus from the crops. We utilized C-13 and N-15 signatures of soil organic matter to assess how rapidly wheat/maize cropping contributed to the humus formation in coarse-textured savanna soils of the South African Highveld. Composite samples were taken from the top 20 cm of soils (Plinthustalfs) cropped for lengths of time varying from 0 to 98 years, after conversion from native grassland savanna (C4). We performed natural 13C and 15N abundance measurements on bulk and particle-size fractions. The bulk soil delta(13)C values steadily decreased from -14.6 in (C4 dominated) grassland to -16.5%o after 90 years of arable cropping. This delta(13)C shift was attributable to increasing replacement of savanna-derived C by wheat crop (C3) C which dominated over maize (C4) inputs. After calculating the annual C input from the crop yields and the output from literature data, by using a stepwise C replacement model, we were able to correct the soil delta(13)C data for the irregular maize inputs for a period of about one century. Within 90 years of cropping 41-89% of the remaining soil organic matter was crop-derived in the three studied agroecosystems. The surface soil C stocks after 90 years of the wheat/maize crop rotation could accurately be described with the Rothamsted Carbon Model, but modelled C inputs to the soil were very low. The coarse sand fraction reflected temporal fluctuations in C-13 of the last C-3 or C-4 cropping and the silt fraction evidenced selective erosion loss of old savanna-derived C. Bulk soil N-15 did not change with increasing cropping length. Decreasing delta(15)N values caused by fertilizer N inputs with prolonged arable cropping were only detected for the coarse sand fraction. This indicated that the present N fertilization was not retained in stable soil C pool. Clearly, conventional cropping practices on the South African highlands neither contribute to the preservation of old savanna C and N, nor the effective humus reformation by the crops.

AB Organic farming, which is growing in popularity, has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to conventional farming practices. However, it is not known how organic farming systems affect soil erosion risk and sediment-bound nutrient transport. Our objectives were to compare soil erosion risk and sediment bound nutrient transport potential for grain-based conventional and organic cropping systems by determining selected soil physical properties and distributions of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in soil aggregates of the 0-5 cm depth of a Christiana-Matapeake-Keyport soil association. We measured soil bulk density, aggregate stability, aggregate size distributions, and total C, N, and P associated with five soil aggregate size classes in no-till (NT) and chisel till (CT) systems and in an organic system (ORG). No-till soils had lesser bulk density and greater aggregate stability than did CT and ORG soils. Carbon, N, and P concentrations were greater in large (>2.00 mm) and small macroaggregates (0.21 to 2.00 mm) than in microaggregates (<0.21 mm) regardless of cropping system. When nutrient concentrations were combined with aggregate distribution data, the quantity of aggregate associated nutrients was greatest in microaggregates in ORG and CT soils but greatest in macroaggregates in NT soils. These results indicate an increased risk of sediment associated nutrient transport from ORG and CT soils compared with NT soils, since microaggregates in these soils are preferentially lost through sediment transport. The NT cropping system promoted macroaggregate formation and reduced the risk of particulate nutrient transport in this warm, humid region soil.

AB [1] Agricultural land uses impact leachable nitrogen (N) and erosion, indicators of the potential for nitrate and sediment contamination of water resources. This paper evaluates the potential impact of alternative land uses on leachable N, soil organic nitrogen (SON) and erosion in western Iowa watersheds using a combination of widely available models and georeferenced data. The alternative land uses increase land area under perennial cover, integrate livestock with cropping systems, and reduce inorganic fertilizer use. We used the Water Erosion Prediction Program (WEPP) to estimate erosion and a N-budget model to estimate leachable N and changes in SON. The N model described here is widely applicable because it utilizes commonly available georeferenced data on soils, crops, and livestock. Maximum annual erosion rates were estimated to be 22 Mg ha(-1) under current conditions, double the regional maximum at which soil is maintained as a medium for plant growth (T). Under alternative land uses, erosion was between 1.1 Mg ha(-1) and 5.5 Mg ha(-1), well below T. Annual leachable N was as much as 43 kg ha(-1) for current conditions, but consistently less than 15 kg ha(-1) under alternative land uses. Maximum SON losses were 23 kg N ha(-1) under current conditions while SON increased by as much as 18 kg N ha(-1) under alternative land uses. These results indicate that erosion may be minimized, leachable N could be decreased and SON may be increased by better accounting of N inputs and altering the distribution and species composition of crop and pasture systems.

AB Soil organic carbon ( SOC) and nutrient stocks in the soil profile ( 0 - 80 cm) in four dominant land uses [ forest, upland maize and millet ( Bari), irrigated rice ( Khet), and grazed systems)] and 0 - 15 cm depth along elevation gradient 1000 to 3000 m, and aspects in the Mardi watershed were measured. Soil properties at 0 - 15 cm depth were also measured in undisturbed forest, forest with free grazed system, managed forest, and grassland to compare the soil quality index ( SQI) of topsoils. The SOC and nutrient concentration decreased with increasing profile depth. The SOC and N contents in the 0 - 15 cm depth of forest soils were significantly greater than the corresponding depth in upland maize and millet, irrigated rice, and grazed systems. On the other hand, available P and K concentrations at the same depth were significantly greater in upland maize and millet compared to irrigated rice, grazed system, and forest land uses. The SOC and N stocks ( 0 - 15 cm) increased from agricultural land at the valley bottom at about 1000 m above mean sea level ( a.s.l.) ( 24 and 3 Mg ha(-1)) compared to undisturbed forest ( 74 and 5.9 Mg ha(-1)) at 2600 m a.s.l, demonstrating the effects of cover and elevation. Both SOC and N stocks decreased sharply in grassland ( 54 and 4.5 Mg ha(-1)) at elevations of 2600 to 2800 m a.s.l. compared with undisturbed forest. Above 2800 m a.s.l. the cover type changed from grass to coniferous forest, and the SOC and N stocks steadily increased at the summit level ( 3200 m a.s.l.) to 65 and 6.9 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Slope and aspect significantly affected SOC with the northwest aspect having significantly higher concentrations ( 46 g kg(-1)) than other aspects. Similarly, SOC concentration at the lowest slope position ( 39 g kg(-1)) was significantly higher than the middle or upper positions ( 25 and 13 g kg(-1)). Integrated soil quality index ( SQI) values varied from 0.17 to 0.69 for different land uses, being highest for undisturbed forest and lowest for irrigated rice. The SQI demonstrated the degradation status of land uses in the following ascending order: irrigated rice > grazed system > forest with free grazing > upland maize and millet > managed forest > grass land > undisturbed forest. The irrigated rice, grazed system, upland maize and millet, and freely grazed forestlands need immediate attention to minimize further deterioration of soil quality in these land uses.

AB Vegetative cover plays an important role for the quality of soil especially in hilly and mountainous areas such as Azad Jammu and Kashmir where erosion is a major threat to the ecosystem and productivity. The study focuses on the impact of land-use types on soil quality by measuring the differences in chemical and physical properties at three sites in adjacently located natural forest land ( forest), fallow grassland ( grass) and arable land ( arable). Soil samples from 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm depth were collected and examined for particle distribution, dry bulk density, organic matter ( OM), pH, macro- and micro-nutrients. Land-use types had a significant effect on primary soil particle distribution. Highest clay content was found in forest and highest sand content in arable. Forest had relatively the highest levels of OM, macro- and micro-nutrients and arable the lowest. Most of the properties of the 0 - 15 cm surface level of grass were similar to those observed in the 15 - 30 cm level in forest. Arable exhibited lowest nutrient status and poorest physical conditions, indicating a degrading effect of arable cultivation practices on soil. Grass and arable showed, compared to forest, a 30 - 60% average increase in bulk density and 26 - 66% average decrease in OM. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation of OM with available phosphorus and potassium while it had negative correlation with dry bulk density and pH. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the organic carbon stock, and increased the nutrient status of soil and is therefore important for sustainable development of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and other similar areas. Furthermore, OM was shown to be an important indicator of soil quality.

AB A hydrochemical model, using hydrograph separation, developed for the Niger basin, has been proposed as a strategic tool for studying the watershed dynamics at any time and space scales. The model is applied to the Amazon basin, including the main channel and its major tributaries. The database corresponds to a sampling and analytical program developed over 8 cruises at 9 stations (about 70 samples), collected in the framework of the CAMREX Project (1982-1984). The model, based on a hydrograph separation of 3 reservoirs, is successful in extrapolating and predicting the geochemical and environmental behaviour of such large basins, naturally submitted to large secular or annual, regular or even catastrophic climatic oscillations. Several topics have been considered. (1) Coherence among the physico-chemical analyses: dissolved species (pH, NH4+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NO3-, HCO3-, Cl-, DOC-, SO42-, HPO42-, SiO2, O-2 and CO2), and inorganic or organic suspended load (fine and coarse fractions FSS, CSS, POCF, POCC). (2) Hydrograph separation in 3 reservoir contributions: R-S, the superficial or rapid runoff, R-1, the hypodermic or intermediate runoff, including the flood plain contributions, and R-B the ground water or base flow. (3) Estimation of the isotopic and physico-chemical features of each of the 3 flow components: R-S, R-I, and R-B. (4) Determination of the 3 hydrological parameters (size of the reservoir, drying up coefficient, and residence time of water), characterizing each of the 3 flow components (R-S, R-I, and R-B), in each of the 9 basins considered. (5) Hydrological and geochemical balances for all the parameters analysed either (a) cruise by cruise for all tributaries and the Amazon River at Obidos, or (b) among each of the 3 river flow components. (6) Isotopic data set of delta(18)O in waters, tests of coherence of the hydrograph separation model. (7) Relationships between isotopic signatures and morphological or hydroclimatical parameters characterizing the river-soil-vegetation systems. The developed procedure presents a new tool in environmental predictions, emphasizing the potentiality of geochemical interpretation of complex hydrochemical data sets. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forest degradation, manifested through decline in forest cover, and the resulting soil erosion and organic carbon losses, is a serious problem caused by a complex coupling of bio-physical, socio-economic and technological factors in the Himalayan watersheds. Greater understanding of the linkages between these factors requires a systems approach. We have proposed such an approach using a bio-economic model to explore the system behaviour of forest degradation, soil erosion, and soil C losses in the forest areas. The outcome of the model simulation over a 20-year period indicates that soil erosion and C loss rates may increase more than four-fold by the year 2020 under the existing socio-economic and biophysical regime (the base scenario). Reductions in the population growth rate, introduction of improved agricultural technology and increase in the prices of major agricultural crops can help slow down the rates of forest decline, soil erosion and C loss or even stabilize or reverse them. The results suggest that economic incentives may be highly effective in the reduction of soil loss, as well as C release to the atmosphere. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Forest and grassland soils in highlands of southern Mediterranean Turkey are being seriously degraded and destructed due to extensive agricultural activities. This study investigated the effects of changes in land-use type on some soil properties in a Mediterranean plateau. Three adjacent land-use types included the cultivated lands, which have been converted from pastures for 12 years, fragmented forests, and unaltered pastures lands. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from four sites at each of the three different land-use types from depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm in Typic Haploxeroll soils with an elevation of about 1400 m. When the pasture was converted into cultivation, soil organic matter (SOM) pool of cultivated lands for a depth of 0-20 cm were significantly reduced by, on average 49% relative to SOM content of the pasture lands. There was no significant difference in SOM between the depths in each land-use type, and SOM values of the forest and pasture lands were almost similar. There was also a significant change in soil bulk density (BD) among cultivation (1.33 Mg m(-3)), pasture (1.19 Mg m(-3)), and forest (1.25 Mg m(-3)) soils at depth of 0-20 cm. Only for the pasture, BD of the depth of 0-10 cm was significantly different from that of 10-20 cm. Depending upon the increases in BD and disruption of pores by cultivation, total porosity decreased accordingly. Cultivation of the unaltered pasture obviously increased the soil erodibility measured by USLE-K factor for each soil depth, and USLE-K factor was approximately two times greater in the cultivated land than in the pasture indicating the vulnerability of the cultivated land to water erosion. The mean weight diameter (MWD) and water-stable aggregation (WSA) were greater in the pasture and forest soils compared to the cultivated soils, and didn't change with the depth for each land-use type. Aggregates of >4.0 mm size were dominant in the pasture and forest soils, whereas the cultivated soils comprised aggregates of the size <= 0.5 mm. I found that samples collected from cultivated land gave the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity values regardless of soil depths, whereas the highest values were measured on samples from forest soils. In conclusion, the results showed that the cultivation of the pastures degraded the soil physical properties, leaving soils more susceptible to the erosion. This suggests that land disturbances should be strictly avoided in the pastures with the limited soil depth in the southern Mediterranean highlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rate of soil creep sets the tempo at which material is transferred from hill-slopes to fluvial systems over major portions of terrestrial landscapes. Hence, soil creep rates affect the rates of landscape evolution and delivery of terrigenous material to floodplains and eventually to the oceans. Herein, we compile data from all sources worldwide that arc readily available in the literature, and derive common, quantitative characteristics of soil creep from digitized soil displacement profiles that permit estimates of soil flux and comparison between diverse studies. We also search for systematic variations of creep rates with climate and explore potential feedbacks between creep rates and climate. Significant creep is found in a range of environments worldwide and is fueled by diverse physical and biological processes. The considerable inter-site variability overwhelms the dependence of creep rates on hillslope gradient and obscures, but does not conceal, the climate influence. We speculate that the general tendency for rapid creep to be associated with colder climates could exacerbate global climate change. A global rise in temperature, for example, could slow the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 as creep rates decrease by slowing two distinct pedogcnic processes: mineral weathering, which is sensitive function of processes that create and freshen mineral surfaces, and the subaerial delivery of organic carbon stored in soils to rivers and long-lived reservoirs.

AB Species of filamentous, sheath-forming cyanobacteria were the major component in the blackish-brown crusts on the upper millimetre of soils in different regions of India. Chlorophyll a density of these biological crusts on lateritic soils of Bhubaneswar, Orissa, brown forest soils of Salbani, West Bengal, and soils of Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu and sandy soils of old Goa ranged between 248 and 282 mg m(-2), which is of the same order as in the leaves of higher plants. The species composition of cyanobacterial community in these soil crusts of India has been documented. Organisms in the crust absorbed water rapidly, regained photosynthesis and nitrogenase activity, which were stabilized within 48 to 72 h of wetting. The dominant cyanobacteria in the crust were rich in carotenoid pigment, absorbing at 507 nm and mycosporine amino acid-like substances absorbing in UV only when desiccated and simultaneously exposed to bright sunlight. It is concluded that the highly active upper layers of and soils contain certain sheathed cyanobacteria that bind with soil particles forming a matrix protecting them from wind erosion. In addition, they are finely tuned in their physiology to the natural environmental conditions contributing organic matter and nitrogen through carbon and nitrogen fixation, thus increasing soil fertility.

AB Because the properties of eroded soil affect the deposition phenomena and transport capacity of chemical materials by eroded particles, recent research is trying to link the grain-size distribution of the eroded sediment to that of the original soil in order to explain the enrichment of chemical content of the sediment with the respect to the parent soil. In this study, the spatial distribution of nitrogen, phosphorus and total organic carbon was firstly deduced using the measurements carried out in 47 soil samples distributed over a forested basin together with a kriging interpolation method. Then the load of each chemical was calculated at morphological unit and basin scales using the above-mentioned spatial distributions and sediment yield values calculated by the SEDD (SEdiment Delivery Distributed) model, which couples the universal soil loss equation with a spatial disaggregation criterion of sediment delivery processes. Finally, at basin scale, a new expression of the enrichment ratio of a given chemical was applied.

AB The central USA contains some of the most productive agricultural land of the world. Due to the high proportion of land area committed to crops and pasture in this region, the carbon (C) stored and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission due to agriculture represent a large percentage of the total for the USA. Our objective was to summarize potential soil organic C (SOC) sequestration and GHG emission from this region and identify how tillage and cropping system interact to modify these processes. Conservation tillage (CST), including no-tillage (NT), has become more widespread in the region abating erosion and loss of organic rich topsoil and sequestering SOC. The rate of SOC storage in NT compared to conventional tillage (CT) has been significant, but variable, averaging 0.40 +/- 0.61 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) (44 treatment pairs). Conversion of previous cropland to grass with the conservation reserve program increased SOC sequestration by 0.56 +/- 0.60 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) (five treatment pairs). The relatively few data on GHG emission from cropland and managed grazing land in the central USA suggests a need for more research to better understand the interactions of tillage, cropping system and fertilization on SOC sequestration and GHG emission.

AB Agriculture in the southeastern USA can be highly productive (i.e., high photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric CO(2)) due to warm-moist climatic conditions. However, its impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation potential have not been thoroughly characterized. This paper is a review and synthesis of literature pertaining to soil organic C (SOC) sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities in the southeastern USA. Conservation tillage is an effective strategy to regain some of the SOC lost following decades, and in some areas centuries, of intensive soil tillage and erosion. With conventional tillage (CT) as a baseline, SOC sequestration with no tillage (NT) was 0.42 +/- 0.46 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (10 +/- 5 years). Combining cover cropping with NT enhanced SOC sequestration (0.53 +/- 0.45 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) compared with NT and no cover cropping (0.28 +/- 0.44 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). By increasing cropping system complexity, SOC could be increased by 0.22 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), irrespective of tillage management. Taking into account an average C cost of producing and transporting N fertilizer, SOC sequestration could be optimized at 0.24 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) with application of 107 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) on N-responsive crops, irrespective of tillage management. In longer-term studies (5-21 years), poultry litter application led to SOC sequestration of 0.72 +/- 0.67 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (17 +/- 15% of C applied). Land that was previously cropped and converted to forages sequestered SOC at a rate of 1.03 +/- 0.90 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (15 +/- 17 years). Limited data suggest animal grazing increases SOC sequestration on upland pastures. By expanding research on SOC sequestration into more diverse pasture and manure application systems and gathering much needed data on methane and nitrous oxide fluxes under almost any agricultural operation in the region, a more complete analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and potential mitigation from agricultural management systems would be possible. This information will be necessary for developing appropriate technological and political solutions to increase agricultural sustainability and combat environmental degradation in the southeastern USA.

AB [1] Little is known about the role of vegetated hillslope sediment transport in the soil C cycle and soil-atmosphere C exchange. We combined a hillslope sediment transport model with empirical soil C measurements to quantify the erosion and temporal storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) within two grasslands in central California. The sites have contrasting erosional mechanisms: biological perturbation ( Tennessee Valley ( TV)) versus clay-rich soil creep ( Black Diamond ( BD)). The average SOC erosion rates from convex slopes were 1.4 - 2.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at TV and 5 - 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at BD, values that are < 10% of above ground net primary productivity ( ANPP) at both sites. The eroded soil accumulates on depositional slopes. The long term SOC accumulation ( or C sink) rates are similar to 1.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the TV hollow and 1.7 - 2.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the BD footslope. We found that the hillslope C sink is driven primarily by the burial of in situ plant production rather than preservation of eroded SOC, a finding that differs from existing hypotheses. At TV, the net sequestration of atmospheric C by long-term hollow evacuation and refilling depends on the fate of the C exported from the zero order watershed. This study suggests that erosion and deposition are coupled processes that create a previously unrecognized C sink in undisturbed upland watersheds, with a potential to substantially affect the global C balance presently, and over geological timescales.

AB In this study, we examined the effects of the age of erosional fluvial terraces of Makhtesh Ramon (Ramon crater) in the central Negev Desert on soil chemical and biological properties. There were significant effects of erosion age of these terraces on soil moisture, organic carbon, soil salinity, and electrical conductivity. It is known that soil biological activity in arid ecosystems is determined by well-known limiting factors such as soil moisture and organic matter. Significant (P < 0.002) differences in total nematode population and microbial biomass [(22.0-3.4 C-mic (mu g C g(-1) soil)] were observed between terraces. Biological activity of soils in lower and younger terraces was greater than in older and higher terraces. The ecophysiological status (qCO(2)) of the soil microbial community was found to decrease from a maximal value of 1.3 to 0.32 mg CO2-C (gC(mic)h)(-1) along the terraces (from younger to older ones). This study illustrates the integrated effect of age, altitude, and the morphostratigraphic position of terraces on the biological activity of soils.

AB Topsoil replacement on reclaimed mine lands is vital for improved infiltration, plant rooting media, enhanced nutrient cycling, and as a potential source of plant propagules to increase plant community diversity. Varying topsoil depth may influence reclamation success. This study assessed the long-term (24 years) effects of four topsoil replacement depths (0, 20, 40, and 60 cm) on plant community attributes (species richness, diversity, canopy cover, and production) and soil characteristics [ organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), pH, soluble cations, electrical conductivity (EC), and cumulative water infiltration]. Species richness and diversity were highest at the 0 cm topsoil depth and lowest at the 60 cm topsoil depth. Percent canopy cover of grasses was highest (25%) at 60 cm and lowest (15%) at 0 cm topsoil depth. Percent forb cover was highest (6%) at the 0 cm depth and lowest (2%) at 60 cm topsoil depth. Seeded species cover was highest (12%) at the 40 cm depth, but was not significantly different from the other depths. Aboveground biomass was similar between the 40 (727 kg ha(-1)) and 60 cm (787 kg ha(-1)) topsoil depths and higher than the 0 (512 kg ha(-1)) and 20 cm (506 kg ha(-1)) replacement depths. Plant species richness and diversity decreased with increasing topsoil depth, while biomass increased. Organic C mass in the soil profile (75 cm) was greatest in the 60 cm topsoil replacement (18.7 Mg C ha(-1)) and lowest in the 0 and 20 cm treatments (11.3 and 10.5Mg C ha(-1), respectively). N mass (75 cm profile) exhibited a similar pattern with 60 cm of topsoil having the highest (1.9 Mg N ha(-1)) and the 0 and 20 cm the lowest (0.8 Mg N ha(-1) and 0.9 Mg N ha(-1), respectively). Cumulative water infiltration was highest (134 mm) for the 40 cm topsoil depth followed by 60 cm (116 mm), and lowest (61mm) for the 0 cm treatment. Soil N, organic C, and infiltration data indicate topsoil replacement depths of 40 and 60 cm provide the best nutrient status and water storage potential for sustainable reclamation. Placement of shallow topsoil replacement depths should be carefully planned to ensure topsoil thickness is adequate to sustain a vegetative community capable of protecting the soil surface against erosion. Variable topsoil replacement depths can be used in reclamation to manipulate plant community characteristics and create a mosaic of vegetation types. However, the reduced vegetation cover observed at the shallower topsoil depths may not protect against soil erosion; therefore, using variable topsoil depth replacement as a reclamation practice will require careful planning and implementation.

AB The negative health effects of repeated dust exposure have been well documented. In California's San Joaquin Valley, agricultural operations may contribute substantially to airborne particulates. We evaluated four management systems to assess impacts on dust production and soil properties for a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) rotation: standard tillage with (STCC) and without (STNO) cover crop, and conservation tillage with (CTCC) and without (CTNO) cover crop. Gravimetric analysis of total dust (TD, < 100-mu m aerodynamic diameter) and respirable dust (RD, 4-mu m aerodynamic diameter) samples collected in the plume generated by field implements showed that dust concentrations for CTNO treatments were about one-third of their STNO counterparts for both cumulative TD and RD measured throughout the two-year rotation, primarily due to fewer in-field operations. The TD and RD production for STNO and STCC was comparable, whereas the CTCC system produced about twice as much TD and RD as CTNO. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses showed absolute increases of 8 and 39% organic fragments in STCC and CTCC over STNO and CTNO, respectively, while organic fragments in the TD increased by 6% in both cover crop treatments. Soil C content was positively correlated with clay content and increased by an average of 0.12 and 0.07% in the cover crop and non-cover crop treatments, respectively, although soil C for each treatment showed a distinct response to a field texture gradient. While dust emissions show an immediate decrease due to fewer field operations for the conservation tillage treatments, long-term sampling is necessary to determine the effects that increased aggregation through organic matter additions may have on dust production.

AB Documenting the history of catchment deforestation using paleolimnological data involves understanding both the timing and magnitude of change in the input of erosional products to the downstream lake. These products include both physically-eroded soil and the byproducts of burning, primarily charcoal, which arise from both intentional and climatically-induced changes in fire frequency. As a part of the Lake Tanganyika Biodiversity Project's special study on sedimentation, we have investigated the sedimentological composition of seven dated cores from six deltas or delta complexes along the east coast of Lake Tanganyika: the Lubulungu River delta, the Kabesi River delta, the Nyasanga/Kahama River delta, and the Mwamgongo River delta in Tanzania, and the Nyamusenyi River delta and Karonge/Kirasa River delta in Burundi. Changes in sediment mass accumulation rates, composition, and charcoal flux in the littoral and sublittoral zones of the lake that can be linked to watershed disturbance factors in the deltas were examined. Total organic carbon accumulation rates, in particular, are strongly linked to higher sediment mass accumulation from terrestrial sources, and show striking mid-20th century increases at disturbed watershed deltas that may indicate a connection between increased watershed erosion and increased nearshore productivity. However, changes in sedimentation patterns are not solely correlated with the 20th century period of increasing human population in the basin. Fire activity, as recorded by charcoal accumulation rates, was also elevated during arid intervals of the 13th-early 19th centuries. Some differences between northern and southern sedimentation histories appear to be correlated with different histories of human population in central Tanzania in contrast with northern Tanzania and Burundi.

AB Geochemical signals of bulk sedimentary organic matter from three cores from Lake Tanganyika provided information about both internal processes and terrestrial inputs to the lake. Indications of land use change were detected in the geochemical records of the watersheds, and the timing of these changes was consistent with historical records of population demographics. While C:N ratios suggested that the distance from shore might be important in influencing the relative amount of allochthonous vs. autochthonous material, all cores were dominated by autochthonous organic matter. In general, nitrogen isotopes were more positive at disturbed sites, indicating inputs of enriched soil nitrate that was subsequently taken up by phytoplankton. In contrast, carbon isotopes did not reflect land use patterns, and a post-1950s decline in carbon isotope ratios found in all cores may indicate a lake-wide decrease in productivity. These interpretations were consistent with pollen and climate records.

AB A field study was conducted at Fort Benning, Georgia (USA) to evaluate changes in soil organic carbon storage and partitioning in response to site disturbance from ground-based military training. Our primary goal was to investigate the utility of selected soil biogeochemical parameters for monitoring and assessment of land condition in conjunction with restoration and other management activities. Soil was sampled at sites representing a wide range of intensity of land disturbance due to mechanized training, foot and light vehicle traffic, and related activities. Soil chemical and microbial analyses included total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), dissolved organic C, microbial biomass C, and soil respiration. All of these, with the exception of dissolved organic C, showed relatively consistent decreasing trends (significant at P <= 0.05) with increasing site disturbance, consistent with increased loss of topsoil in uplands and sedimentation in bottomlands. Concomitant increases in dissolved organic C:total C and microbial biomass C:total C appear to indicate that the relative bioavailability of soil C increased with soil disturbance despite a decrease in C storage.

AB Rates of sediment accumulation and microbial mineralization were examined at three Kandelia candel forests spanning the intertidal zone along the south coastline of the heavily urbanized Jiulongljiang Estuary, Fujian Province, China. Mass sediment accumulation rates were rapid (range: 10-62 kg m(-2) y(-1)) but decreased from the low- to the high-intertidal zone. High levels of radionuclides suggest that these sediments originate from erosion of agricultural soils within the catchment. Mineralization of sediment carbon and nitrogen was correspondingly rapid, with total rate of mineralization ranging from 135 to 191 mol C m(-2) y(-1) and 9 to 11 mol N m(-2)y(-1); rates were faster in summer than in autumn/winter. Rates of mineralization efficiency (70-93% for C; 69-92% for N) increased, as burial efficiency (7-30% for C; 8-31% for N) decreased, from the low-to the high-intertidal mangroves. Sulphate reduction was the dominant metabolic pathway to a depth of I m, with rates (19-281 nmol S m(-2) d(-1)) exceeding those measured in other intertidal deposits. There is some evidence that Fe and Mn reduction-oxidation cycles are coupled to the activities of live roots within the 0-40 cm depth horizon. Oxic respiration accounted for 5-12% of total carbon mineralization. Methane flux was slow and highly variable when detectable (range: 5-66 pmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Nitrous oxide flux was also highly variable, but within the range (1.6-106.5 mu mol N2O m(-2) d-1) measured in other intertidal sediments. Rates of denitrification were rapid, ranging from 1106 to 3780 mu mol N-2 m(-2) d(-1), and equating to 11-20% of total sediment nitrogen inputs. Denitrification was supported by rapid NH4 release within surface deposits (range: 3.6-6.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Our results support the notion that mangrove forests are net accumulation sites for sediment and associated elements within estuaries, especially Kandelia candel forests receiving significant inputs as a direct result of intense human activity along the south China coast.

ID STORM SURGES; BARROW; SHELF
AB A regional classification of shoreline segments along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea Coast was developed as the basis for quantifying coastal morphology, lithology, and carbon and mineral sediment fluxes. We delineated 48 mainland segments totaling 1,957 km, as well as 1,334 km of spits and islands. Mainland coasts were grouped into five broad classes: exposed bluffs (313 km), bays and inlets (235 km), lagoons with barrier islands (546 km), tapped basins (171 km) and deltas (691 km). Sediments are mostly silts and sands, with occasional gravel, and bank heights generally are low (2-4 m), especially for deltas (< 1 m). Mean annual erosion rates (MAER) by coastline type vary from 0.7 m/year (maximum 10.4 m/year) for lagoons to 2.4 m/year for exposed bluffs (maximum 16.7 m/year). MAERs are much higher in silty soils (3.2 m/year) than in sandy (1.2 m/year) to gravelly (-0.3 m/year) soils. Soil organic carbon along eroding shorelines (deltas excluded) range from 12 to 153 kg/m(2) of bank surface down to the water line. We assume carbon flux out from depositional delta sediments is negligible. Across the entire Alaskan Beaufort Sea Coast, estimated annual carbon input from eroding shorelines ranges from -47 to 818 Mg/km/year (Metric tones/km/year) across the 48 segments, average 149 Mg/km/year (for 34 nondeltaic segments), and total 1.8x10(5) Mg/year. Annual mineral input from eroding shorelines ranges from -1,863 (accreting) to 15,752 Mg/km/year, average 2,743 Mg/km/year, and totals 3.3x10(6) Mg/year.

AB Soil and crop management practices may influence biomass growth and yields of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and sequester significant amount of atmospheric CO, in plant biomass and underlying soil, thereby helping to mitigate the undesirable effects of global warming. This study examined the effects of three tillage practices [no-till (NT), strip till (ST), and chisel till (CT)],. four cover crops [legume (hairy vetch) (Vicia villosa Roth), nonlegume (rye) (Secale cereale L), hairy vetch/rye mixture, and winter weeds or no cover crop], and three N fertilization rates (0, 60-65, and 120-130 kg N ha(-1)) on the amount of C sequestered in cotton lint (lint + seed), sorghum grain. their stalks (stems + leaves) and roots, and underlying soil from 2000 to 2002 In central Georgia, USA. A field experiment was conducted on a Dothan sandy loam (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic. Plinthic Kandiudults). In 2000, C accumulation in cotton lint was greater in NT with rye or vetch/rye mixture but in stalks, it was greater in ST with vetch or vetch/rye mixture than in CT with or without cover crops. Similarly, C accumulation in lint was greater in NT with 60 kg N ha(-1) but in stalks, it was greater in ST with 60 and 120 kg N ha(-1) than in CT with 0 kg N ha(-1). In 2001, C accumulation in sorghum grains and stalks was greater in vetch and vetch/rye mixture with or without N rate than in rye without N rate. In 2002, C accumulation in cotton lint was greater in CT with or without N rate but in stalks, it was greater in ST with 60 and 120 kg N ha(-1) than in NT with or without N rate. Total C accumulation in the above- and belowground biomass in cotton ranged from 1.7 to 5.6 Mg ha(-1) and in sorghum ranged from 3.4 to 7.2 Mg ha(-1). Carbon accumulation in cotton and sorghum roots ranged from 1 to 14% of the total C accumulation in above- and belowground biomass. In NT, soil organic C at 0-10 cm depth was greater in vetch with 0 kg N ha(-1) or in vetch/rye with 120-130 kg N ha(-1) than in weeds with 0 and 60 kg N ha(-1) but at 10-30 cm, it was greater in rye with 120-130 kg N ha(-1) than in weeds with or without rate. In ST, soil organic C at 0-10 cm was greater in rye with 120-130 kg N ha(-1) than in rye, vetch, vetch/rye and weeds with 0 and 60 kg N ha(-1). Soil organic C at 0-10 and 10-30 cm was also greater in NT and ST than in CT. Since 5 to 24% of C accumulation in lint and grain were harvested, C sequestered in cotton and sorghum stalks and roots can be significant in the terrestrial ecosystem and can significantly increase C storage in the soil if these residues are left after lint or grain harvest, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of global warming. Conservation tillage, such as ST, with hairy vetch/rye mixture cover crops and 6065 kg N ha(-1) can sustain C accumulation in cotton lint and sorghum grain and increase C storage soil compared with conventional tillage, such as CT, with no cover crop and N fertilization, thereby maintaining crop yields, improving soil quality, and reducing erosion.

AB Soil organic matter that could be combined with soil particles into large aggregates, may reduce soil erosion. However, soil organic matter itself is a possible source of water pollution. The objective of the present study was to analyze organo-mineral complexes and their effects on flocculation and settling characteristics of soils. Particle-size fractionation and flocculation/settlement experiment were conducted by using 7 types of soil samples (smectic heavy clay soils with 5 types of agricultural practices, alluvial clay loam soil, and volcanic heavy clay soil). All the samples were taken from paddy fields in Japan. Particle size fractionation showed that short-term (4 years) organic matter application to the smectic soil had increased the number of coarse organic particles. Puddled ponding water in the smectic heavy clay field under 4 years of organic matter application led to the highest levels of total organic carbon and particulate organic carbon among the sampling fields. Therefore, the coarse organic particles were considered to be easily suspended by puddling. The high float-ability of coarse organic particles was consistent with their low density and weak association with minerals. Flocculation/settlement experiments showed the significant effect of pH decrease by organic matter application on the settlement of the smectic soil particles. The alluvial soil, volcanic soil, and smectic soils under continuous (4 years and 19 years) organic matter application could form large flocs even at 50 mm NaCl, while the smectic soils under conventional tillage, no-tillage, and no-puddling required more than 200 mm NaCl for rapid settlement. Sodium pyrophosphate treatment of the dispersive soils resulted in higher concentrations of carbon and nitrogen in the upper layer (0-4 cm) of their suspension after 8 h of settlement, although the treatment had reduced the organic matter content of the soils. The reduction in the hetero-flocculation of the soil particles with different charge characteristics was considered to be the possible process for the increased dispersibility of the soils by the removal of organo-mineral complexes, because the smectic soil did not show a rapid settlement at the average point of zero salt effect for the whole soil components. Based on the settlement profiles, we estimated that the reduction of nutrient losses (suspended load) from surface ponding water in puddled fields was 74-112 kgC ha(-1) and 6-7 kgN ha(-1) by 8 h of settlement, and at least 100-157 kgC ha(-1) and 9-10 kgN ha(-1) by 8 It of settlement with an improvement in the pH and electrolyte concentrations.

AB Good management of the uplands is essential and effective buffer zones along the streams draining the basin will complete the task of water quality protection. Most basin drainage moves through the riparian zones of first- and second-order headwaters streams. It is important to have continuous buffers on both sides of these streams. For larger streams, protect the flood plains. Several zones of buffer vegetation are most effective. A narrow grass strip at the upland edge traps suspended particulates and phosphorus. A wider zone of woody vegetation traps nitrate, and both cools and provides natural organic matter to the receiving waters. Contour the buffer surface to avoid concentrated storm flows and periodically remove sediment berms that develop. For a completely degraded riparian zone, it is essential to provide soils of the right porosity and organic carbon content. Sub-soils need to be permeable and to have a reasonable groundwater retention time. High organic carbon is required to develop a low redox potential. Provide short-term protection from erosion. Only add native species. Sometimes, exotic plants get established and must be eradicated. Fence livestock out. Control excessive activity by wild ungulates, voles, and beaver.

AB Changes in soil properties reflect the success or failure of reclamation practices on abandoned wellsites. We examined the effect on soil properties of four (0, 50, 100 and 150%) topsoil replacement depths (TRD) and five amendment treatments [compost, manure, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay, check] aimed at reclaiming three wellsites (Strathmore, Hesketh and Rosedale) in southcentral Alberta. TRD treatment differences were consistent across all wellsites, with 30 to 32% higher soil organic carbon (SOC) on the 150% TRD compared to the 0% TRD. Initially, the alfalfa treatment showed higher levels of nitrate-nitrogen (e.g., 26 mg kg(-1) vs. 3 to 7 mg kg(-1) for the other amendment treatments in the 15- to 30-cm depth at Strathmore in fall 1998), which was related to its rapid breakdown and mineralization of organic N. After 40 mo (June 1997-October 2000), the average amounts (n = 3 wellsites) of added C conserved near the soil surface were: compost (65 +/- 10% SE) > manure (45 +/- 16% SE) > alfalfa (28 +/- 11% SE) > straw (23 +/- 6% SE). Our results show that organic amendments play an important role in improving soil properties related to long-term productivity of reclaimed wellsites, especially where topsoil is scarce or absent.

AB Reducing and off-setting anthropogenic emissions of CO, and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) are important strategies of mitigating the greenhouse effect. Thus, the need for developing carbon (C) neutral and renewable sources of energy is more than ever before. Use of crop residue as a possible source of feedstock for bioenergy production must be critically and objectively assessed because of its positive impact on soil C sequestration.. soil quality maintenance and ecosystem functions. The amount of crop residue produced in the US is estimated at 367x10(6) Mg/year for 9 cereal crops, 450x10(6) Mg/year for 14 cereals and legumes, and 488x10(6) Mg/year for 21 crops. The amount of crop residue produced in the world is estimated at 2802x10(6) Mg/year for cereal crops, 3107x10(6) Mg/year for 17 cereals and legumes, and 3758x10(6) Mg/year for 27 food crops. The fuel value of the total annual residue produced is estimated at 1.5x10(15) kcal, about I billion barrels (bbl) of diesel equivalent, or about 8 quads for the US; and 11.3x10(15) kcal, about 7.5 billion bbl of diesel or 60 quads for the world. However, even a partial removal (30-40%) of crop residue from land can exacerbate soil erosion hazard, deplete the SOC pool, accentuate emission of CO, and other GHGs from soil to the atmosphere, and exacerbate the risks of global climate change. Therefore, establishing bioenergy plantations of site-specific species with potential of producing 10-15 Mg biomass/year is an option that needs to be considered. This option will require 40-60 million hectares of land in the US and about 250 million hectares worldwide to establish bioenergy plantations. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage generally represents the long-term net balance of photosynthesis and total respiration in terrestrial ecosystems. However, soil erosion can affect SOC content by direct removal of soil and reduction of the surface soil depth; it also affects plant growth and soil biological activity, soil air CO(2) concentration, water regimes, soil temperature, soil respiration, carbon flux to the atmosphere, and carbon deposition in soil. In arid and semi-arid region of northern China, wind erosion caused soil degradation and desert expansion. This paper estimated the SOC loss of the surface horizon at eroded regions based on soil property and wind erosion intensity data. The SOC loss in China because of wind erosion was about 75 Tg C yr(-1) in 1990s. The spatial pattern of SOC loss indicates that SOC loss of the surface horizon increases significantly with the increase of soil wind erosion intensity. The comparison of SOC loss and annual net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystem was discussed in wind erosion regions of China. We found that NPP is also low in the eroded regions and heavy SOC loss often occurs in regions where NPP is very small. However, there is potential to improve our study to resolve uncertainty on the soil organic matter oxidation and soil deposition processes in eroded and deposited sites.

AB Carbon loss and the associated potential for facilitated transport of chemicals could be better quantified if effects of storm intensity variation could be characterized during key phases of the production year. We evaluated the effects of constant and variable rainfall intensities on the transport characteristics and amount of sediment organic carbon lost from two highly weathered Coastal Plain soils in Georgia-a Tifton loamy sand (Plinthic Kandiudult) and a Greenville sandy clay loam (Rhodic Kandiudult). Soils were air-dried, sieved (19 mm) and placed in 1.5 m(2) stainless steel erosion pans set to match typical field slopes for each soil (Tifton = 4 percent; Greenville = 7 percent). Simulated rainfall was applied for 70-min as a constant (57 mm h(-1)) or variable (typical spring storm) event pattern. Runoff, sediment, sediment carbon, sediment nitrogen, and dissolved carbon were measured at five-minute intervals. Regardless of simulation intensity evaluated, sediment exported from the Tifton soil was enriched (enrichment ratio 1.17 to 1.80) and the Greeneville soil depleted (0.83 to 0.93) in carbon relative to the top 2 cm of undisturbed soil. Only minor (not significant) differences were observed in the potential for total sediment carbon loss estimated by the two simulation intensities (Tifton, 5.65 - 6.67 kg ha(-1) and Greenville, 13-44 - 14.40 kg ha(-1)). However, significant differences in the effect of simulation intensities on timing and amount of carbon lost via sediment transport (more during first versus second half of simulation for variable versus constant intensity patterns respectively) were observed during the simulations. Results suggest that detachment and transport thresholds differ for total sediment versus sediment carbon tosses during a given event and that variable rate rainfall simulations may be an effective means to characterize threshold differences for individual soil and management combinations. It is suggested that the systematic determination of such thresholds may improve predictions of sediment transported organic contaminants.

AB Cover crop roots and shoots release carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) compounds in situ during their decomposition. Depending upon the season, these C and N compounds may be sequestered, the C may be respired or the N may be leached below the root zone. A field study was established to identify the contributions of cover crop root and shoot N to different regions within aggregates in the A(P) horizon of a Kalamazoo loam soil. Fall-planted rye plants (Secale cereale L.) were labeled the next May with foliar applications of solutions containing 99% atom ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4. Isotopic enrichment of soil aggregates ranging from 2.0 to 4.0, 4.0-6.3 and 6.3-9.5 mm across was determined following plant residue applications. Concentric layers of aggregates were removed from each aggregate by newly designed meso soil aggregate erosion (SAE) chambers. Non-uniform distributions of total N and recently derived rye N in soil macroaggregates, across time, suggested that the formations and functions of macroaggregates are very dynamics processes and soil aggregates influence where N is deposited. Early in the season, more 15 N migrated to the interior regions of the smallest aggregates, 2-4 mm across, but it was limited to only surfaces and transitional regions of the larger aggregates, 6.3-9.3 mm across. Exterior layers of aggregates between 6.0 and 9.5 mm retained 1.6% of the N-derived from roots in July 1999, which was three times more than their interior regions. This was slightly greater than the % N-derived (from shoot). One month later, as the maize root absorption of N increased rapidly, % Nderived front roots and % Nderived from shoot were nearly equal in exterior layers and interior regions of soil aggregates. This equilibrium distribution may have been from either greater diffusion of N within the aggregates and/or maize root removal form aggregate exteriors. Results supported that most of roots grew preferentially around surfaces of soil aggregates rather than through aggregates. Cover crop roots contributed as much N as cover crop shoots to the total soil N pool. Subsequent crops use N from the most easily accessible zones of soil structure, which are surfaces of larger soil aggregates. Therefore maintaining active plant roots and aggregated soil structure in the soil enhances N sequestration and maximize soil N availability. These studies suggest that the rapid and perhaps bulk flow of soil N solutions may bypass many of the central regions of soil aggregates, resulting in greater leaching losses.

AB This study gives an insight into the source of organic carbon and nitrogen in the Godavari river and its tributaries, the yield of organic carbon from the catchment, seasonal variability in their concentration and the ultimate flux of organic and inorganic carbon into the Bay of Bengal. Particulate organic carbon/particulate organic nitrogen (POC/PON or C/N) ratios revealed that the dominant source of organic matter ill the high season is from the soil (C/N = 8-14), while in the rest of the seasons, the river-derived (in situ) phytoplankton is the major source (C/N = 1-8). Amount of organic materials carried from the lower catchment and flood plains to the oceans during the high season are 3 to 91 times higher than in the moderate and low seasons. Large-scale erosion and deforestation in the catchment has led to higher net yield of organic carbon in the Godavari catchment when compared to other major world rivers. The total flux of POC, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the Godavari river to the Bay of Bengal is estimated as 756 x 10(9) and 2520 x 10(9) g yr(-1), respectively. About 22% of POC is lost in the main channel because of oxidation of labile organic matter, entrapment of organic material behind dams/sedimentation along flood plains and river channel; the DIC fluxes as a function of alkalinity are conservative throughout the river channel. Finally, the C/N ratios (similar to 12) of the ultimate fluxes of particulate organic carbon suggest the dominance of refractory/ stable soil organic matter that could eventually get buried in the coastal sediments on a geological time scale.

AB Accelerated erosion involves preferential removal of soil organic carbon (SOC) because it is concentrated in vicinity of the soil surface and has lower density than the mineral fraction. The SOC transported by water runoff is redistributed over the landscape and deposited in depressional sites where it is buried along with the sediments. However, the fate of the SOC transported, redistributed and deposited by erosional processes is a subject of intense debate. Sedimentologists argue that SOC buried with sediments is physically protected, and that depleted in the eroded soil is replaced through biomass production. Thus, they argue that the erosion-sedimentation process leads to globally net SOC sequestration of 0.6-1.5 Gt C/year. In contrast, soil scientists argue that: (i) a large portion of the SOC transported by water runoff comprises labile fraction, (ii) breakdown of aggregation by raindrop impact and shearing force of runoff accentuates mineralization of the previously protected organic matter, and (iii) the SOC within the plow zone at the depositional sites may be subject to rapid mineralization, along with methanogenesis and denitrification under anaerobic environment. Whereas, tillage erosion may also cause burial of some SOC, increase in soil erosion and emission Of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion are net sources of atmospheric CO2. Soil scientists argue that soil erosion may be a net source of atmospheric CO2 with emission of I Gt C/year. It is thus important to understand the fate of eroded SOC by measuring and monitoring SOC pool in eroded landscape as influenced by intensity and frequency of tillage operations and cropping systems.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are affected by tillage, soil erosion and depositional processes. The objectives of this paper are to evaluate soil organic carbon and fly-ash distribution methods for identifying eroded phases of soils in Illinois and Russia and quantifying the extent of soil loss from erosion. The effect of accelerated erosion on soils is recorded on National Cooperative Soil Survey maps as phases of soil series that reflect the percentage of the original A horizon materials remaining. Identification depends on knowledge of the original A horizon thicknesses, SOC and fly-ash contents at uncultivated and uneroded sites when determining erosion phases of soil at cultivated and eroded sites. However, locating uncultivated and uneroded comparison sites with similar landscape and slope characteristics can be difficult. The amount of A horizon materials within the plow layers (Ap horizons) or topsoils are often determined by soil colors which reflect the SOC contents. Soil erosion phases based on original A horizon materials remaining in the topsoils may underestimate the extent of soil losses from topsoils and subsoils, particularly where soils have been cultivated for hundreds of years and are severely eroded. The SOC contents and soil erosion phases can be affected by losses or gains of organic C-rich sediments from tillage translocation and erosion, by management input level differences, oxidation, or as a result of land use and landscape position variations. Fly-ash was found to be more stable and act as a better indicator of soil erosion phase than SOC content. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB From 1983 to 1989 an erosion-productivity study was conducted in Iowa. The primary objective of this project was to determine the effects of accelerated erosion and its interactions with other variables on soil productivity, as measured by corn yields of loess and till-derived soils in Iowa. Multiple regression techniques were used to relate corn yields to erosion and selected soil, climatic, and weather variables. Organic matter content of the soils was significantly correlated with erosion phase. Yields of till-derived soils decreased more with increasing degree of erosion than loess-derived soils. The conclusions are based on data collected at 569 sites located in 44 Iowa counties. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil erosion and depositional processes in relation to land use and soil management need to be quantified to better understand the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. This study was undertaken on a Miamian soil (Oxyaquic Hapludalfs) under on-farm conditions in western Ohio with the objectives of evaluating the effects of degree of erosion on SOC stock under a range of tillage systems. Six farms selected for this study were under: no-till (NT) for 15, 10, 6 and 1.5 years; chisel till every alternate year with annual manure application (MCT); and annual chisel till (ACT). A nearby forest (F) site on the same soil was chosen as control. Using the depth of A horizon as an indicator of the degree of erosion, four erosion phases identified were: uneroded (flat fields under F, NT15, and on the summit of sloping fields under NT10, NT6, NT 1.5 and MCT); deposition (NT10, NT6, NT1.5 and ACT); slight (NT 10, MCT and ACT); and moderate erosion (NT 10 and ACT). Core and bulk soil samples were collected in triplicate from four depths (i.e., 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-50 cm) for each erosional phase in each field for the determination of bulk density, and SOC concentrations and stocks. SOC concentration in NT fields increased at a rate of 5% year(-1) for 0-10 cm and 2.5% year(-1) for 10-20 cm layer with increasing duration under NT. High SOC concentration for NT15 is indicative of SOC-sequestration potential upon conversion from plow till to NT. SOC concentration declined by 19.0-14.5 g kg(-1) in MCT and 11.3-9.7 g kg(-1) in NT10 between uneroded and slight erosion, and 12.0-11.2 g kg(-1) between slight and moderate erosion in ACT. Overall SOC stock was greatest in the forest for each of the four depths. Total SOC stock for the 50 cm soil layer varied in the order F (71.99 Mg ha(-1)) > NT15 (56.10 Mg ha(-1)) > NT10 (37.89 Mg ha(-1)) = NT6 (36.58 Mg ha(-1)) for uneroded phase (P < 0.05). The lack of uneroded phase in ACT indicated high erosion risks of tillage, as also indicated by the high SOC stock for deposition phase from 0 to 50 cm soil layer (ACT (56.56 Mg ha(-1)) > NT1.5 (42.70 Mg ha(-1)) > NT10 (30.97 Mg ha(-1))). Tillage increased soil erosion and decreased SOC stock for top 10 cm layer for all erosional phases except deposition. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil carbon (C) losses and soil translocation from tillage operations have been identified as causes of soil degradation and soil erosion. The objective of this work was to quantify the variability in tillage-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) loss by moldboard (MP) and chisel (CP) plowing across an eroded landscape and relate the C loss to soil properties. The study site was a 4 ha wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Marshall) field with rolling topography and five soil types in the Svea-Barnes complex in west central Minnesota (N. Latitude = 45 degrees 41'W, Longitude = 95 degrees 43'). Soil properties were measured at several depths at a 10 m spacing along north-south (N-S) and west-east (W-E) transects through severely eroded, moderately eroded and non-eroded sites. Conventional MP (25 cm deep) and CP (15 cm deep) equipment were used along the pre-marked transects. Gas exchange measurements were obtained with a large, portable chamber within 2 m of each sample site following tillage. The measured CO2 fluxes were largest with the MP > CP > not tilled (before tillage). The variation in 24 h cumulative CO2 flux from MP was nearly 3-fold on the N-S transect and 4-fold on the W-E transect. The surface soil organic C on the transects was lowest on the eroded knolls at 5.1 g C kg(-1) and increased to 19.6 g C kg(-1) in the depositional areas. The lowest CO2 fluxes were measured from severely eroded sites which indicated that the variation in CO2 loss was partially reflected by the degradation of soil properties caused by historic tillage-induced soil translocation with some wind and water erosion.
   The spatial variation across the rolling landscape complicates the determination of non-point sources of soil C loss and suggests the need for improved conservation tillage methods to maintain soil and air quality in agricultural production systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Many factors including management history, soil type, climate, and soil landscape processes affect the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC). The primary objective of this research was to determine the effects of no-tillage and tillage systems on the SOC content after 12 years of controlled treatments. A tillage experiment with three treatments (no-till (NT), chisel plow (CP) and moldboard plow (MP)) was initiated in the spring of 1989 in southern Illinois. The plot area was previously in a tall fescue hayland for 15 years and had a 6% slope. Maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) were grown in the plot area on a yearly rotation system starting with maize. Periodically, the SOC content of various soil layers, to a depth of either 30 or 75 cm, was measured and expressed on both a gravimetric and volumetric basis. After 12 years, the 0-15 cm surface soil layer of MP was significantly lower in SOC than the NT and CP plots. For all but 2 values, the significance of findings did not change with the form of expression (gravimetric versus volumetric). The surface layer (0-15 cm), subsoil (15-75 cm), and rooting zone (075 cm) of all treatments had reduction in SOC on a volumetric basis when compared to the pre-treatment values for sod. At the end of the 12-year study, the MP system had significantly less SOC in the surface layer, subsurface layer and rooting zone than the NT system at comparable depths. After 12 years of tillage under a maize-soybean rotation, the NT treatment sequestered or maintained more SOC stock (47.0 Mt ha(-1)) than the CP (43.7 Mt ha(-1)) and MP (37.7 Mt ha(-1)) treatments. The annual rate of SOC stock build up in the root zone (0-75 cm), above the MP system base, was 0.71 Mt ha(-1) year(-1) for the NT system and 0.46 Mt ha(-1) year(-1) for the CP system. For land coming out of the Conservation Reserve Program and returning to row crop production, NT and CP systems would maintain more SOC stock than MP system and reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.

AB The potential for wind erosion in South Central Colorado is greatest in the spring, especially after harvesting of crops such as potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) that leave small amounts of crop residue in the surface after harvest. Therefore it is important to implement best management practices that reduce potential wind erosion and that we understand how cropping systems are impacting soil erosion, carbon dynamics, and properties of rangeland sandy soils. We evaluate the effects of cropping systems on soil physical and chemical properties of rangeland sandy soils. The cropping system included a small grain-potato rotation. An uncultivated rangeland site and three fields that two decades ago were converted from rangeland into cultivated centerpivot-irrigation-sprinkler fields were also sampled. Plant and soil samples were collected in the rangeland area and the three adjacent cultivated sites. The soils at these sites were classified as a Gunbarrel loamy sand (Mixed, frigid Typic Psammaquent). We found that for the rangeland site, soil where brush species were growing exhibited C sequestration and increases in soil organic matter (SOM) while the bare soil areas of the rangeland are losing significant amounts of fine particles, nutrients and soil organic carbon (SOM-C) mainly due to wind erosion. When we compared the cultivated sites to the uncultivated rangeland, we found that the SOM-C and soil organic matter nitrogen (SOM-N) increased with increases in crop residue returned into the soils. Our results showed that even with potato crops, which are high intensity cultivated cropping systems, we can maintain the SOM-C with a rotation of two small grain crops (all residue incorporated) and one potato crop, or potentially increase the average SOM-C with a rotation of four small grain crops (all residue incorporated) and one potato crop. Erosion losses of fine silt and clay particles were reduced with the inclusion of small grains. Small grains have the potential to contribute to the conservation of SOM and/or sequester SOM-C and SOM-N for these rangeland systems that have very low C content and that are also losing C from their bare soils areas (40%). Cultivation of these rangelands using rotations with at least two small grain crops can reduce erosion and maintain SOM-C and increasing the number of small grain crops grown successfully in rotation above two will potentially contribute to C and N sequestration as SOM and to the sequestration of macro- and micro-nutrients.

AB Soil erosion contributes to the removal and redistribution of soil organic C from cultivated fields. The soil organic C content of wind erodible and water unstable aggregates is an important factor in determining the amount of carbon loss occurring in erosion processes. The relative distribution of organic carbon among aggregate size fractions may also affect the response of soils to erosion. Soil organic C distribution is dependent on the chosen management system. The effects of no-till, till, and grassland management systems on organic C content of erodible and non-erodible aggregates were examined in six Ustolls and two Usterts of central South Dakota. Organic C contents were related to dry- and wet-sieving to represent the potential influence of wind and water erosion on C loss in the absence of vegetative cover. Loss of aggregate stability in cultivated soils was associated with organic C loss. Most structural characteristics developed under tilled systems persisted after 6-16 years of no-till. Changes in distribution of organic C due to management systems were most evident in Ustolls where cultivation resulted in net soil C losses. Soil organic C was not significantly increased by the no-tillage practices applied in this on-farm study (in Ustolls 49 Mg ha(-1) in no-till versus 41 Mg ha-1 in till, for 0-0.20 m depth). Soil properties of Usterts were less affected by land use and management practices due to the high shrink swell action and self-mixing. In both soil orders the greater concentration of organic C in the wind erodible (< 1 mm) dry aggregate size fraction implies a high potential for organic C loss by erosion in addition to organic C loss from mineralization after tillage. Grassland when compared to cultivated topsoil showed the largest amounts of organic carbon stored and the minimal potential for erosion loss of soil organic C. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Long-term cultivation impacts soil properties. During the early 1920s a study comparing non-cultivated and cultivated soils was done in eastern SD (Beadle, McCook, Minnehaha, and Union Counties), USA. The objectives of the current study were to: (1) determine the long-term (> 80 years) impact of cultivation on selected soil properties; and (2) establish baseline soil data that can be used for future comparisons. Sample sites were located in well-drained summit and upper backslope positions. These topographic positions are strongly influenced by erosion processes from tillage, wind, and water. Previous studies at other locations in the region suggest that one might expect a loss of 10-20 cm of soil in > 80 years of cultivation at these topographic positions. In the early 1920s the soils were tested for carbon (C) (total, organic, inorganic), total nitrogen (N), total sulfur (S), total calcium (Ca), total phosphorus (P), total potassium (K), and total magnesium (Mg). The 1920s study sites were resampled at 0-15, 15-50, and 50-100 cm depths and analyzed for C (total, organic, inorganic), N (total, nitrate-N), extractable P, extractable K, delta N (N-15/N-14 or delta(15)N) for total N, delta C (C-13/C-12 or delta(13)C) for total C, and pH. Long-term cultivation (> 80 years) in the northern Great Plains of the United States has caused many significant reductions in surface soil (0-15 cm) extractable P, extractable K, surface pH, total C, organic C, total N, and 815 N for total N. In addition, the organic C to total N ratio for the 15-50 cm depth of cultivated soils was significantly lower when compared to non-cultivated soils. Cultivation caused significant increases in nitrate-N, delta C, inorganic C, and in the total C to total N and inorganic C to total N ratios (15-100 cm depths). Soil properties varied significantly with increasing soil depth. Soil pH, delta(13)C for total C, inorganic C, total C to total N ratio, and inorganic C to total N ratio increased significantly as soil depth increased. Nitrate-N, extractable P, extractable K, delta(15)N for total N, organic C, and total N decreased significantly as soil depth increased. Soil carbon changes at the sample sites are a combined result of differences in the reference surface elevation, carbon mineralization, and redistribution of carbon due to erosion. Changes in soil nutrient levels reflect crop removal, leaching, erosion, and pedogenic processes. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Summer fallow (fallow) is still widely used on the North American Great Plains to replenish soil moisture between crops. Our objective was to examine how fallowing affects soil organic carbon (SOC) in various agronomic and climate settings by reviewing long-term studies in the midwestern USA (five sites) and the Canadian prairies (17 sites). In most soils, SOC increased with cropping frequency though not usually in a linear fashion. In the Canadian studies, SOC response to tillage and cropping frequency varied with climate-in semiarid conditions, SOC gains under no-till were about 250 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) greater than for tilled systems regardless of cropping frequency; in subhumid environments, the advantage was about 50 kg ha-1 yr-1 for rotations with fallow but 250 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) with continuous cropping. Specific crops also influenced SOC: Replacing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) had little effect; replacing wheat with lower-yielding flax (Linum usitatismum L.) reduced SOC gains; and replacing wheat with erosion-preventing fall rye (Secale cereale L.) increased SOC gains. In unfertilized systems, cropping frequency did not affect SOC gains, but in fertilized systems, SOC gains often increased with cropping frequency. In a Colorado study (three sites each with three slope positions), SOC gains increased with cropping frequency, but the response tended to be highest at the lowest potential evaporation site (where residue C inputs were greatest) and least in the toeslope positions (despite their high residue C inputs). The Century and the Campbell et al. SOC models satisfactorily simulated the relative responses of SOC although they underestimated gains by about one-third.

AB This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different organic and inorganic amendments on nutrient (C, N and P) distribution in water-stable aggregates (WSA) of a degraded tropical Ultisol at Nsukka in southern Nigeria. The treatments were control (C), inorganic fertilizer (F) (N-P-K, 12-12-17), rice-mill wastes (RW), RW + F, poultry manure (PM) and RW + PM. These were arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. At 0, 3, 6 and 12 months after application of the amendments, topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were collected from all the treatments, dried and separated into 4.75-2.0, 2.0-1.0, 1.00.5, 0.50-0.25 and <0.25 rum aggregates classes by wet sieving. The mesoaggregates fraction (1.0-0.50 mm) made up the highest percentage of the whole soil irrespective of the treatments. From the sixth month, the treatments generally reduced the proportion of these mesoaggregates as well as those of the microaggregates (<0.25 mm diameter) while increasing those of the other sizes.
   The largest (>2.0 mm) and the smallest (<0.25 mm) aggregates were preferentially enriched in C and N relative to the 2.0-0.25 mm aggregates in all the treatments, whereas P distribution within the aggregates was random. There was a low, but significant correlation between organic carbon and mean-weight diameter (MWD) of the aggregates. The correlation between C and N within the aggregates was also positive (r = 0.917) and highly significant (P < 0.01). The implication of these results for management of these soils is discussed.

AB SOIL CARBON AND THE MITIGATION OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. The soils of the world contain more carbon than the combined total amounts occurring in vegetation and the atmosphere. Hence soils are a major reservoir of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and an important sink. Recently, emphasis has been placed on the need to sequester carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide into soil organic matter because of international concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change. The best strategies to built-up carbon stocks in the soil are basically those that increase the input of organic matter to the soil, and/or decrease the rate of soil organic matter decomposition. Grain crop systems based on soil ploughing and harrowing lead to Co-2 emissions combined with tremendous soil losses. In Brazil, no-tillage system was introduced to combat soil erosion by water and this soil management led to the build-up of soil carbon stocks with simultaneous high crop yields. However, the present procedure used to quantify carbon stocks in soils is laborious and of high cost. The use of infrared spectroscopy is very promising as an alternative low-cost method of soil carbon determination.

AB The dominant landscape process on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska is the formation and drainage of thaw lakes. Lakes and drained thaw-lake basins account for approximately 75% of the modem surface expression of the Barrow Peninsula. The thaw-lake cycle usually obliterates lacustrine or peat sediments from previous cycles, which could otherwise be used for paleoecological reconstruction of long-term landscape and vegetation changes. Several possible erosional remnants of a former topographic surface that predates the formation of the thaw lakes have been tentatively identified. These remnants are characterized by a higher elevation, a thick organic layer with very high ground ice content in the upper permafrost and a plant community somewhat atypical of the region. Ten soil cores were collected from one site, and one core was intensively sampled for soil organic carbon content, pollen analysis and C-14 dating. The lowest level of the organic sediments represents the earliest phase of plant growth and dates to ca. 9000 cal BP. Palynological, evidence indicates the presence of mesic shrub tundra (including sedge, birch, willow and heath vegetation), and microfossil indicators point to wetter eutrophic conditions during this period. Carbon accumulation was rapid due to high net primary productivity in a relatively nutrient-rich environment. These results are interpreted as the local response to ameliorating climate during the early Holocene. The middle Holocene portion of the record contains an unconformity, indicating that between 8200 and 4200 cal BP sediments were eroded from the site, presumably in response to wind activity during a drier period centered around 4500 cal BP. The modem vegetation community of the erosional remnant was established after 4200 cal BP and peat growth resumed. During the late Holocene, carbon accumulation rates (CARs) were greatly reduced in response to the combined effects of declining productivity associated with climatic cooling, and increased nutrient stress as paludification and permafrost aggradation sequestered mineral nutrients.

AB Land-use changes and degradation of forests and soils in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region have important implications for CO2 emissions and global climatic change that calls for an interdisciplinary research to analyse the complexity of the problem. This paper represents an effort in this direction by reviewing the literature on land-use changes, forest/soil degradation and their effects on C sequestration in this region. The main objective of this study was to document knowledge on C sequestration as affected by land-use changes and forest/soil degradation. We found a very few attempts at studying the subject in its entirety, and a lack of reliable data on essential ecological parameters related to the dynamics of C sequestration in the region. Estimates of land-use changes, loss of soil due to erosion and soil organic carbon contents by dominant land-use categories have been documented from the available studies in the region. Some evidence exists to show that the land-use changes and forest/soil degradation affect C pools significantly. The net emissions of C due to land-use changes in Nepal were reported to be 6.9 x 10(6) to 42.1 x 10(6) Mg year(-1) by earlier studies. In contrast to these findings, our own estimate for the year 1994 was 1.47 x 10(6) Mg year(-1), representing C emissions from fuelwood consumption and loss of soil due to erosion less C fixation due to annual vegetation growth. Finally, an analytical framework is presented for investigating the dynamics of C sequestration. On the basis of review of past studies, there appeared to be a high potential for enhancing the C sequestration in the vegetation and soils of the Himalayan region through improved management of degraded lands. It is suggested that the complexity of dynamics of C sequestration caused by diverse bio-physical and socio-economic factors in the region needs ideally be analysed by following systems approach in the future research endeavours.

AB The dynamics of vegetation-driven spatial heterogeneity (VDSH) and its function in structuring runoff and sediment fluxes have received increased attention from both geomorphological and ecological perspectives, particularly in arid regions with sparse vegetation cover. This paper reviews the recent findings in this area obtained from field evidence and numerical simulation experiments, and outlines their implications for soil erosion assessment. VDSH is often observed at two scales, individual plant clumps and stands of clumps.
   At the patch scale, the local outcomes of vegetated patches on soil erodibility and hydraulic soil properties are well established. They involve greater water storage capacity as well as increased organic carbon and nutrient inputs. These effects operate together with an enhanced capacity for the interception of water and windborne resources, and an increased biological activity that accelerates breakdown of plant litter and nutrient turnover rates. This suite of relationships, which often involve positive feedback mechanisms, creates vegetated patches that are increasingly different from nearby bare ground areas. By this way a mosaic builds up with bare ground and vegetated patches coupled together, respectively, as sources and sinks of water, sediments and nutrients.
   At the stand scale within-storm temporal variability of rainfall intensity controls reinfiltration of overland How and its decay with slope length. At moderate rainfall intensity, this factor interacts with the spatial structure of VDSH and the mechanism of overland flow generation. Reinfiltration is greater in small-grained VDSH and topsoil saturation excess overland flow. Available information shows that VDSH structures of sources and sinks of water and sediments evolve dynamically with hillslope fluxes and tune their spatial configurations to them.
   Rainfall simulation experiments in large plots show that coarsening VDSH leads to significantly greater erosion rates even under heavy rainfall intensity because of the flow concentration and its velocity increase. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Many soils in southeastern Utah are protected from surface disturbance by biological soil crusts that stabilize soils and reduce erosion by wind and water. When these crusts are disturbed by land use, soils become susceptible to erosion. In this study, we compare a never-grazed grassland in Canyonlands National Park with two historically grazed sites with similar geologic, geomorphic, and geochemical characteristics that were grazed from the late 1800s until 1974. We show that, despite almost 30 years without livestock grazing, surface soils in the historically grazed sites have 38-43% less silt, as well as 14-51% less total elemental soil Mg, Na, P, and Mn content relative to soils never exposed to livestock disturbances. Using magnetic measurement of soil magnetite content (a proxy for the stabilization of far-traveled eolian dust) we suggest that the differences in Mg, Na, P, and Mn are related to wind erosion of soil fine particles after the historical disturbance by livestock grazing. Historical grazing may also lead to changes in soil organic matter content including declines of 60-70% in surface soil C and N relative to the never-grazed sites. Collectively, the differences in soil C and N content and the evidence for substantial rock-derived nutrient loss to wind erosion implies that livestock grazing could have long-lasting effects on the soil fertility of native grasslands in this part of southeastern Utah. This study suggests that nutrient loss due to wind erosion of soils should be a consideration for management decisions related to the long-term sustainability of grazing operations in and environments.

AB The Holocene environmental history and climate are reconstructed for Ratasjoen, a low- alpine lake in south-central Norway. The reconstructions are based on chironomids, diatoms, pollen, plant macrofossils, and sediment characteristics. From plant macrofossil evidence, birch trees (Betula pubescens) immigrated ca. 10,000 cal BP. The chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature was high, but may be unreliable during the early stages of the lake's history due to the high abundance of Chironomus anthracinus type, a taxon that may include several species. From ca. 9000 cal BP the inferred mean July temperature was lower (ca. 9 degreesC). Temperatures increased towards 8000 cal BP and pine ( Pinus sylvestris) reached its upper limit near the lake. July temperature may have become a significant factor controlling long-term pH in the lake, starting shortly after 8000 cal BP. High pH values were associated with periods of warm summers and lower pH values occurred during periods of colder summers. Alkalinity processes within the lake and/or the catchment are possible factors controlling this relationship. A temperature decline at ca. 5400 cal BP separated two 10.6 degreesC temperature maxima around 6400 and 4500 cal BP. The 1.5 degreesC decline in July air temperatures from ca. 4400 cal BP was paralleled by a decrease of pH from 7.2 to 6.8. Following the temperature drop, first pine and then birch trees declined and disappeared from the catchment and organic accumulation in the lake increased. The increased organic accumulation rate had a positive effect on diatom production. At ca. 2700 cal BP the temperature reached a minimum (ca. 9.2 degreesC) and correspondingly a second pH minimum was reached. Temperature decreased again slightly at ca. 400 cal BP during the 'Little Ice Age', before increasing by about 0.5 degreesC towards the present. Percentage organic carbon as estimated by loss-on-ignition appears to be better correlated with chironomid-inferred July temperatures than organic accumulation rates, at least for the last 9000 years. Accumulation rates of organic sediments are more coupled with catchment-related processes, such as erosion and major changes in vegetation, than is percentage organic carbon.

AB Lake sediments of the Karlicher Blauton deposited during Late Oligocene times in the Neuwied Basin, Germany, were analyzed for major element concentrations (X-ray fluorescence analysis) and total organic carbon content (LECO analysis), complemented by organic petrology, and mineralogical studies. The mineralogical composition of the Karlicher Blanton in the core Schmidtenhohe 3 is characterized by cyclically fluctuating amounts of illite, muscovite, smectite, kaolinite and heavy minerals (rutile and zircon). The overall geochemical composition suggests a elastic supply to Lake Blauton from a deeply weathered source, probably locally exposed Devonian rocks and/or volcanogenic material. The cyclic depositional pattern could reflect alternating phases of soil development and soil erosion in the lake catchment area, or may be controlled by tectonic and/or volcanogenic processes.

AB Overgrazing is one of the main causes of desertification in the semiarid Horqin sandy grassland of northern China. Excluding grazing livestock is considered as an alternative to restore vegetation in degraded sandy grassland in this region. However, few data are available concerning the impacts of continuous grazing and livestock exclusion on soil properties. In this paper, characteristics of vegetation and soil properties under continuous grazing and exclusion of livestock for 5 and 10 years were examined in representative degraded sandy grassland. Continuous grazing resulted in a considerable decrease in ground cover, which accelerates soil erosion by wind, leading to a further coarseness in surface soil, loss of soil organic C and N, and a decrease in soil biological properties. The grassland under continuous grazing is in the stage of very strong degradation. Excluding livestock grazing enhances vegetation recovery, litter accumulation, and development of annual and perennial grasses. Soil organic C and total N concentrations, soil biological properties including some enzyme activities and basal soil respiration improved following 10-year exclusion of livestock, suggesting that degradation of the grassland is being reversed. The results suggest that excluding grazing livestock on the desertified sandy grassland in the erosion-prone Horqin region has a great potential to restore soil fertility, sequester soil organic carbon and improve biological activity. Soil restoration is a slow process although the vegetation can recover rapidly after removal of livestock. A viable option for sandy grassland management should be to adopt proper exclosure in a rotation grazing system in the initial stage of grassland degradation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Bashang area, located in the semiarid agropastoral zone, represents a typical degraded ecosystem under intensified human activities. This region has undergone profound land use changes during the past century. Natural grasslands had been progressively cultivated, and subsequently, part of cultivated lands had been abandoned by farmers due to severe desertification. In this study, we collected soil samples (0-20 cm depth) from four farmlands on both flat and gentle slope lands where cultivation had occurred for 0, 8, 30, and 50 years to assess the effects of grassland cultivation on soil degradation. In addition, soil samples were taken and plant species were investigated from eight sites in age sequence of 0- to 50- year-old abandoned field to assess natural restoration process following field abandonment. The results showed that cultivation of grassland result in a significant soil degradation which is manifested by the coarsening in soil texture and the losses in organic C and nutrients. After 50 years of cultivation, soil organic C, total N, and total P concentrations had declined 73-79%, 60-70%, and 67-68% in the 0-20 cm plough layer, respectively. Over half of these losses occurred during the first 8 years of cultivation, and subsequent was slow. After fields were abandoned, vegetation got self-restoration, and plant species composition moved toward that of the natural grassland community with time. Soil organic C, total N, and total P levels gradually improved with increasing years of land abandonment, with a faster restoration rate in the early vegetation recovery stage and a slower rate in the late succession stage. The results suggested that soil degradation may occurred drastically by inappropriate land use and management with a short time, while soil restoration for a degraded ecosystem may take long period of time, especially in this fragile ecosystem. From the perspective of soil resource management and desertification control, conservational tillage and management for farmlands and proper grazing management for recovered grassland should be taken into account in this area.

AB A life cycle assessment of different cropping systems emphasizing corn and soybean production was performed, assuming that biomass from the cropping systems is utilized for producing biofuels (i.e., ethanol and biodiesel). The functional unit is defined as 1 ha of arable land producing biomass for biofuels to compare the environmental performance of the different cropping systems. The external functions are allocated by introducing alternative product systems (the system expansion allocation approach). Nonrenewable energy consumption, global warming impact, acidification and eutrophication are considered as potential environmental impacts and estimated by characterization factors given by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA-TRACI). The benefits of corn stover removal are (1) lower nitrogen related environmental burdens from the soil, (2) higher ethanol production rate per unit arable land, and (3) energy recovery from lignin-rich fermentation residues, while the disadvantages of corn stover removal are a lower accumulation rate of soil organic carbon and higher fuel consumption in harvesting corn stover. Planting winter cover crops can compensate for some disadvantages (i.e., soil organic carbon levels and soil erosion) of removing corn stover. Cover crops also permit more corn stover to be harvested. Thus, utilization of corn stover and winter cover crops can improve the eco-efficiency of the cropping systems. When biomass from the cropping systems is utilized for biofuel production, all the cropping systems studied here offer environmental benefits in terms of nonrenewable energy consumption and global warming impact. Therefore utilizing biomass for biofuels would save nonrenewable energy, and reduce greenhouse gases. However, unless additional measures such as planting cover crops were taken, utilization of biomass for biofuels would also tend to increase acidification and eutrophication, primarily because large nitrogen (and phosphorus)-related environmental burdens are released from the soil during cultivation.

AB An IPCC-based Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) was developed to monitor soil organic C stocks and flows to assist New Zealand to achieve its CO2 emissions reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol. Geo-referenced soil C data from 1158 sites (0.3 in depth) were used to assign steady-state soil C stocks to various combinations of soil class, climate, and land use. Overall, CMS soil C stock estimates are consistent with detailed, stratified soil C measurements at specific sites and over larger regions. Soil C changes accompanying land-use changes were quantified using a national set of land-use effects (LUEs). These were derived using a General Linear Model to include the effects of numeric predictors (e.g., slope angle). Major uncertainties arise from estimates of changes in the areas involved, the assumption that soil C is at steady state for all land-cover types, and lack of soil C data for some LUEs. Total national soil organic C stocks estimated using the LUEs for 0-0.1, 0.1-0.3, and 0.3-1 in depths were 1300 +/- 20, 1590 +/- 30, and 1750 +/- 70 Tg, respectively. Most soil C is stored in grazing lands (1480 +/- 60 Tg to 0.3 in depth), which appear to be at or near steady state; their conversion to exotic forests and shrubland contributed most to the predicted national soil C loss of 0.6 +/- 0.2 Tg C yr(-1) during 1990-2000. Predicted and measured soil C changes for the grazing-forestry conversion agreed closely. Other uncertainties in our current soil CMS include: spatially integrated annual changes in soil C for the major land-use changes, lack of soil C change estimates below 0.3 in, C losses from erosion, the contribution of agricultural management of organic soils, and a possible interaction between land use and our soil-climate classification. Our approach could be adapted for use by other countries with land-use-change issues that differ from those in the IPCC default methodology.

AB In long-term experiments, it has been demonstrated that management of cropland influences the evolution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. National inventories of SOC stocks in Belgium have recently been compiled, and show an evolution of SOC stocks of arable land from 1960 to 1990 and 2000. In order to analyse the driving forces of these changes, we concentrate on the SOC evolution in the soil associations of three of the 13 Belgian agricultural regions (Dunes-Polders, Loam belt and Condroz). The small confidence limits around the mean SOC values within some soil associations (0.4-12.7 t C ha(-1)) allow us to compare the observed values with the results of the RothC soil carbon model and hence quantify the most important driving forces. After estimating the local parameters by fitting the model to SOC values from a long-term experiment in central Belgium, the model was run from 1960 to 2000 for typical soil profiles of soil associations in the three agricultural regions. The main factors inducing changes in SOC stocks are'the increase in plough depth as a result of continued mechanisation in the 1960s and the sustained input of organic amendments in the form of farmyard manure and slurry. In contrast to earlier publications on CO2 emissions from agricultural soils, the model did not predict a decrease in SOC stocks for the period 1990-2000. A slight increase Was observed, although this increase is not significant for most soil associations. The comparison between modelled and observed SOC data at two time slices allows the uncertainty of the model results to be estimated. This uncertainty ranges from 7.5 to 14.4% of the SOC stock and is in the same order of magnitude as the uncertainty around SOC modelling for the long-term experiments both in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe. The organic matter concentration in the topsoil, an indicator for soil quality, was in the range of 1.5 to 3.3%. Organic matter content increased in the Dunes-Polders and decreased in the Loam belt and the Condroz from 1960 to 2000. Many soils in the Loam belt are now close to the critical level of 2% under which the soils are vulnerable to compaction and erosion.

AB Forest fires are frequent in the Mediterranean area and the intensity of these fires determines their impact on soil properties, runoff and erosion rates. Furthermore, Mediterranean plant species are affected differently by forest-fire intensity. Different soil and vegetation scenarios, therefore, occur in an area following a forest fire depending on the intensity of the fire and, consequently, soil recuperation times vary. The aim of this chapter is to test the values of a number of soil parameters in an area subject to different fire intensities in 1994. The sampling was carried out in 2001, 7 years after the fire. Comparison of a low intensity burnt area (LIB) and a high intensity burnt area (HIB) with a control forest (CF) shows that soil parameters have yet to recover the control values. Recovery has been slowest in the HIB area. For example, in 2001, soil pH in the CF was 5.94 and 6.37 in the LIB area and 6.49 in the HIB area. The soil organic carbon was 6.01% in the CF, 3.29% in the LIB area and 1.67% in the HIB area. The total soil nitrogen was 0.44% in the CF, 0.23% in the LIB area and 0.15% in the HIB area. The concentration of cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) in the soil was higher in the CF, with the exception of potassium where values in the LIB area and CF were similar in both plots. The best correlation between bases was found in CF. Interestingly, no correlation was found between sodium concentrations and the other cations, while calcium concentrations presented a weaker correlation with soil organic carbon and nitrogen in the HIB area than they did in the LIB area, where, in fact, these parameters showed a strong correlation. This analysis has demonstrated that after 7 years there are still significant differences between the three areas of different burnt intensity in all the properties except sodium.

AB Carbon terrestrial sinks are often seen as a low-cost alternative to fuel switching and reduced fossil fuel use for lowering atmospheric CO(2). To determine whether this is true for agriculture, one meta-regression analysis (52 studies, 536 observations) examines the costs of switching from conventional tillage to no-till, while another (51 studies, 374 observations) compares carbon accumulation under the two practices. Costs per ton of carbon uptake are determined by combining the two results. The viability of agricultural carbon sinks is found to vary by region and crop, with no-till representing a low-cost option in some regions (costs of less than $10 per tC), but a high-cost option in others (costs of 100-$400 per tC). A particularly important finding is that no-till cultivation may store no carbon at all if measurements are taken at sufficient depth. In some circumstances no-till cultivation may yield a "triple dividend" of carbon storage, increased returns and reduced soil erosion, but in many others creating carbon offset credits in agricultural soils is not cost effective because reduced tillage practices store little or no carbon.

AB Soil classification is the categorization of soils into groups at varying levels of generalization according to their morphological, physical, and chemical properties and/or assumed genesis that are important for the objectives of the classification. One of these objectives is establishing groups or subdivisions of the soils in a useful manner such as predicting behavior, identifying best uses, estimating productivity, and identifying potential problems. The purpose of this study was classification of the soils at phases of the soil series level based on Soil Taxonomy to show the most important soil characteristics effective in land suitability for plant growth and in yield prediction.
   The study area is 100 hectares and is located in the Silakhor plain in the Lorestan province of Iran. The mean annual temperature of the area is 14.5 degrees C. The annual precipitation is about 490 mm. The soil moisture and temperature regimes are Dry Xeric and Thermic, respectively. In a detailed soil survey, 25 soil profiles 2100 m apart were described, sampled, and analyzed in the laboratory for physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties. The soils of the area were classified into two orders (Inceptisols and Entisols), three suborders (Xerepts, Orthents. and Psamments), four great groups (Calcixerepts, Haploxerepts, Xerorthents, and Xeropsamments), five subgroups, ten families, twenty-three soil series, and twenty-five phases of the soil series.
   The properties of the Inceptisols include the presence of cambic and/or calcic horizons. A unique property common to the Entisols is the absence of distinct pedogenic horizons. The suborder of the studied Inceptisols is Xerept. The suborders of the Entisols are Orthent and Psamment. Calcic and cambic horizons were used as one basis for defining the great groups of the Xerepts. The presence of a blocky structure, the removal of carbonates, and/or an increase in the clay content were used to indicate cambic horizons. The Xeric moisture regime of the studied area keyed Orthents and Psamments into the great groups, Xerorthents and Xeropsamments.
   At the subgroup level, ninety-six percent of the soils were classified as typic subgroups. The particle size and mineralogy classes of the control section and the soil temperature regime were used to group the soils within a subgroup into different families. The criteria that were used for classifying the soils of a family into different soil series included the depth and the thickness of the calcic and cambic horizons, the drainage class within the series control section, and the organic carbon content in the surface horizon.
   Phases were differentiated on the basis of the surface texture, the surface and subsurface stoniness, the slope, and erosion. In each of these categories, the extent of qualitative suitability of several land characteristics or land qualities for plant growth and crop production or for a general land use was clarified. These land characteristics or qualities are also determinants of soil management. There are selected methods and techniques that permit anticipation of potential irrigated and rainfed yields of crops. In the estimation of crop yields, land characteristics or land qualities are also one of the main factors limiting crop production.

AB 1. Soil quality is related to the capacity of soil to deliver ecosystem services on a sustainable basis.
   2. Effective management of soil within grasslands can deliver many benefits to mankind but poor management may cause loss of soil quality from erosion, loss of organic matter, physical deterioration etc.
   3. Services are delivered from soil by biological processes. Soil quality depends on the form and condition of the soil habitat. Fixed factors (e.g. texture) are useful for assigning soil to types. Variable factors (e.g. organic carbon) can then be used to assess quality within soil types, by reference to percentiles of the distribution of values for a given type.
   4. Systematic monitoring of soil quality is useful for identifying the possible need for field level actions at regional to landscape scales. Assessment and management of soil quality at a local scale is supported more efficiently and effectively by in-field observation of soil profiles.

AB Soil erosion, such as wind erosion and water erosion, has become a very serious problem all over the world since man began cultivating the land. A large number of factors have influence on it, like soil surface characteristics, rainfall and runoff and so on. This study focuses on one of the factors controlling soil erodibility: soil aggregate stability. Samples were taken from two different land management systems in the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand (green manure and fallow). The samples were prep treated using three treatments (freezing only, freezing followed by thawing, or simply field moist) and then aggregate stability was measured by wet sieving. The results show that the soil aggregate stability strongly depends on the soil state, management and organic matter content. For the same management, the ranking of the aggregate stability is: Field moist (not frozen) > f reezing- then- thawing > frozen. In the same state, the soil with more organic matter is more stable than the less. In addition, some discussion is provided to analyze the controlling mechanisms.

AB In the marginal Mediterranean areas of the northwest of the Syrian Arab Republic, land degradation is a serious problem, particularly on vulnerable agricultural land. The traditional land-husbandry practices have not kept pace with the intensification and expansion of olive production into steeper areas. In these areas, soil erosion by water and tillage is widespread, especially where the soil is left bare as result of intensive clear-tillage and where no land-conservation measures are applied. These conditions are prevalent in the northwestern hills of the Syrian Arab Republic.
   In 1997, a small research project was started in Yakhour, a typical olive-producing village in the area. The aim was to develop, test and refine options for better land management that have the potential to stabilize and increase the productivity of the olive groves. The research followed a farmer-participatory approach that involved a large part of the community for selection of options and conducting controlled on-farm experiments with farmer consultation. Socio-economic studies and a survey of the land-users' perceptions of land degradation and constraints for the adoption of land-conservation measures confirmed that the land users were aware of the serious degradation of their agricultural land. Rainfall simulation studies revealed the high erodibility of the soils in the area.
   In association with the farmers, two different comprehensive packages of soil- and water-conservation measures were designed for the olive groves. One was an "agronomic package" designed to increase vegetation soil cover (by vetch intercropping), reduce soil disturbance (by minimizing tillage), and enhance soil structure (by incorporating organic materials) and short-term chemical soil fertility (by application of mineral nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). A second "structural package" was based on designing and building earthen, semi-lunar-shaped water-harvesting bunds. This package was applied in addition to the first package. Emphasis was placed on those soil- and land-management practices that reduce soil erosion and help restore soil fertility.
   After five years, the conservation measures had led to a marked improvement in the soil in terms of fertility, organic carbon content, and structure stability, while soil and nutrient losses had been reduced. The improved soil parameters were associated with a marked increase in olive productivity of 25-75 percent. As a result of the close cooperation with the villagers, the suitability of the measures to reduce soil erosion was successful and vetch intercropping has expanded in the village.

AB Land application of biosolids is a beneficial-use practice whose ecological effects depend in part on hydrological effects. Biosolids were surface-applied to square 0.5-m(2) plots at four rates (0, 7, 34, and 90 dry Mg ha(-1)) on each of three soil-cover combinations in Chihuahuan Desert grassland and shrubland. Infiltration and erosion were measured during two seasons for three biosolids post-application ages. Infiltration was measured during eight periods of a 30-min simulated rain. Biosolids application affected infiltration rate, cumulative infiltration, and erosion. Infiltration increased with increasing biosolids application rate. Application of biosolids at 90 dry Mg ha(-1) increased steady-state infiltration rate by 1.9 to 7.9 cm h(-1). Most of the measured differences in runoff among biosolids application rates were too large to be the result of interception losses and/or increased hydraulic gradient due to increased roughness. Soil erosion was reduced by the application of biosolids; however, the extent of reduction in erosion depended on the initial erodibility of the site. Typically, the greatest marginal reductions in erosion were achieved at the lower biosolids application rates (7 and 34 dry Mg ha(-1)); the difference in erosion between 34 and 90 dry Mg ha(-1) biosolids application rates was not significant. Surface application of biosolids has important hydrological consequences on runoff and soil erosion in desert grasslands that depend on the rate of biosolids applied, and the site and biosolids characteristics.

AB Tillage erosion had been identified as a major process of soil redistribution on sloping arable land. The objectives of our study were to investigate the extent of tillage erosion and its effect on soil quality and productivity under Danish conditions. Soil samples were collected to a 0.45-m depth on a regular grid from a 1.9-ha site and analyzed for Cs-137 inventories, as a measure of soil redistribution, soil texture, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, and phosphorus (P) contents. Grain yield was determined at the same sampling points. Substantial soil redistribution had occurred during the past decades, mainly due to tillage. Average tillage erosion rates of 2.7 kg m(-2) yr(-1) occurred on the shoulderslopes, while deposition amounted to 1.2 kg m(-2) yr(-1) on foot- and toeslopes. The pattern of soil redistribution could not be explained by water erosion. Soil organic carbon and P contents in soil profiles increased from the shoulder- toward the toeslopes. Tillage translocation rates were strongly correlated with SOC contents, A-horizon depth, and P contents. Thus, tillage erosion had led to truncated soils on shoulderslopes and deep, colluvial soils on the foot- and toeslopes, substantially affecting within-field variability of soil properties. We concluded that tillage erosion has important implications for SOC dynamics on hummocky land and increases the risk for nutrient losses by overland flow and leaching. Despite the occurrence of deep soils across the study area, evidence suggested that crop productivity was affected by tillage-induced soil redistribution. However, tillage erosion effects on crop yield were confounded by topography-yield relationships.

AB The variability of surface soils on the same field is influenced largely by soil erosion and runoff deposition. The general and spatial variability of soils oil runoff Plots under the influence of vetiver grass strips (VGS) was therefore Studied using both the conventional "Fisher" statistics and geostatistics. The focus was oil safe use of vetiver system for combating land degradation in view of its various advantages. The overall objective was to quantify the variability in relation to VGS effects oil the soil and its influence oil other plants. The VGS were established at 20 in spacing two years earlier, hence some soil had accumalated oil the upper slope side at a mean rate of 71.0 mm per year. There were greater faunal activities around the VGS than elsewhere in the field. The study area was oil it 5% slope and grid (5 m x 3 m) systematic sampling was used; the samples were collected at depths of 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm were processed and analyzed physically and chemically. Static soil properties such as total sand (ranged 712 to 866 g kg(-1)) and bulk density (1.24 to 1.51 g cm(-3)) had low co-efficient of variation (CV) values (CV < 15%), and dynamic soil properties, which Could easily be influenced by management, (such as available phosphorus, P, and silt; ranging from 2.85 to 13.2 mg kg(-1) and 64 to 174 g kg(-1) respectively) had high CV values of 35% to 70%. Gravel content (50.4-175.1 g kg(-1)) was not significantly different amongst plots in the field. All the parameters analyzed Followed a normal frequency distribution. For the geostatistics, considered along a south-north transect only, the semivariances approached the overall variance, Ko, within distance lags of 5-20 in forclay at 5-10cm depth, total sand and soil pH at 0-5 cm depth. Values beyond the variance distances, Ko, were considered independent of each other. Bulk density, available P, and soil pH revealed no spatial dependence oil the VGS effect. The results of the effects of VGS on properties of soils bound by it showed that clay and bulk density were less with VGS than without; 83.83 g kg(-1) clay with VGS and 90.5 g kg(-I) Without VGS; bulk density of 1.40 g cm(-3) with VGS and 1.43 g cm-3 Without VGS both at 0-5 cm depth. The reverse was observed for sand content, though; their effects were linked to slope, erosion and pedogenic factors rather than VGS. Among the chemical properties, organic carbon (OC and total nitrogen (TN) were higher in parcels of land bounded by the VGS than those without. At 5-10 cm depth, OC was 14.25 g kg(-1) with VGS and 11.35 g kg(-1) Without. Similar rise was observed for soil pH; 5.61 with VGS and 5.25 in the control without VGS at 0-5 cm depth. In contrast, available P was lower in lags bounded by VGS than those Without VGS. The use of the VGS technology in combination with mechanical measures such as along water ways, gully embankments, roadsides and sloppy farm-lands to protect and rehabilitate marginal lands to facilitate crop production, and the integration of soil variability with problem solving were recommended. It was Concluded that since VGS did not cause any significant difference in the soil physical properties it call be safely used as ail environmentally-friendly natural resource to improve and protect farmlands and infrastructures. However, the application of geostatistics was not necessary because of the small volume of the data involved, conventional statistics were enough to fully quantify the variability.

AB The soils of the semi-arid areas of northeastern Ethiopia are poor in Soil nutrients owing to intensive soil erosion, continuous cereal growing, and age-old Cultivation. Consequently, low soil fertility is the most severe constraint to small holder crop production and to sustainable food security. Farmers in northeastern Ethiopia are also very poor in resource endowment and are incapable Of Supplying the nutrient requirements of crops through commercial fertilizers. Therefore, integrated nutrient management through the combined use of mineral and organic fertilizer Sources is of great importance for the Sustainable improvement of soil productivity in intensive cropping systems. This study evaluated the integrated use of mineral fertilizers at the rates of 0%, 50% and 100% of the recommended rates and the organic fertilizer source (farmyard manure, FYM) at the rates of 0, 5, 10, and 15 t ha(-1). The results indicated that the highest significant grain yield increases were obtained when 15 t ha(-1) FYM was applied with 50% and 100% of the recommended levels of mineral fertilizers followed by application of 10 t ha(-1) FYM alone. These yield increments gave yield benefits of 50%, 51% and 47% over the control. In addition both FYM and mineral fertilizer application positively influenced stover yield and panicle weight. Four years' application of FYM at the rates of 10 and 15 t ha(-1) increased the soil total N content by 17 to 24%, organic carbon by 13 to 26%, available P by 67 to 85%, K by 42 to 79% and Mg by 6 to 30% compared to the plot lacking FYM application in the 0-20 cm soil depth.

AB Agricultural ecosystems generally contain less soil organic carbon (SOC) pool than their potential capacity because of the low return and high rate of mineralization of biosolids, and severe losses due to accelerated erosion and leaching. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversitythe activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. The gross rates of SOC sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 400 to 800 kg/ha/y for cool and humid regions and 100 to 200 kg/ha/y for dry and warm climates. The potential of soil C sequestration in Brazil is estimated at about 50 Tg C/y. In addition, 60 Tg C/y emitted by erosion-induced mineralization can also be avoided through effective erosion control measures.

AB Mined areas are a continuing source of heavy metals and acidity that move off site in response to erosion. Revegetation of the mine tailings could limit the spread of these heavy metals and acidity. This study was conducted to evaluate, at four tailings on opencast mines of Galicia (Touro: copper mine; and Meirama: lignite mine, NW Spain), the chemical and physical soil quality indicators and limiting edaphic factors concerning forest production. Selected zones were: (1) The tailings formed by the waste materials from the depleted Touro mine; (2) the decantation site of deposited sludge coming from the copper extraction in the flotation stage; (3) and (4) tailings of 3 and 10 years old of the Meirama lignite mine.
   The main physical limitations of the mine soils are the low effective depth (< 50cm), high stoniness (> 30 percent) and high porosity (> 60 percent); which make them vulnerable to soil erosion and seriously interferes with the forest production. Soils coming from the decantation site of copper mine do not have physical limitations.
   The main chemical limitations of mine soils are their acidity (pH from 3.62 to 5.71), and aluminium saturation (> 60 per cent in copper mine soils, and > 20 per cent in lignite mine soils), low CECe (from 5.34 to 9.47 cmol((+)) kg(-1)), organic carbon (from 0.47 to 7.52 mg kg(-1)) and Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents, and imbalance between exchange bases.
   Mine soils coming from the decantation site of copper mine soils are strongly limited by the high Cu content (1218 mg kg(-1)). Lime and organic amendments are the most important factors in providing a suitable medium for plant growth. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley M Sons, Ltd.

AB Restoration of degraded soils is a development strategy to reduce desertification, soil erosion and environmental degradation, and alleviate chronic food shortages with great potential in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Further, it has the potential to provide terrestrial sinks of carbon (C) and reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO(2). Soil organic carbon (SOC) contents decrease by 0 to 63 per cent following deforestation. There exists a high potential for increasing SOC through establishment of natural or improved fallow systems (agroforestry) with attainable rates of C sequestration in the range of 0.1 to 5.3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Biomass burning significantly reduces SOC in the upper few centimeters of soil, but has little impact below 10 to 20 cm depth. The timing of burning is also important, and periods with large amounts of biomass available generally have the largest losses of SOC. In cultivated areas, the addition of manure in combination with crop residues and no-till show similar rates of attainable C sequestration (0 to 0.36 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Attainable rates of SOC sequestration on permanent cropland in SSA under improved cultivation systems (e.g. no-till) range from 0.2 to 1.5 Tg C yr(-1), while attainable rates under fallow systems are 0.4 to 18.5 Tg C yr(-1). Fallow systems generally have the highest potential for SOC sequestration in SSA with rates up to 28.5 Tg C yr(-1). Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Forest management practices such as clear-cutting, site preparation, ditching, and ditch network maintenance increase nitrogen (N) load to streams. In environmentally sustainable forestry, water protection actions are required to decrease the nutrient loading. These include e. g. use of uncut buffer zones between a clear-cut area and a waterbody, sedimentation ponds in the ditch network and overland flow fields. In practical forestry, there is an increasing need for developing design criteria for effective protective actions. Clearly, the efficiency of a protective construction depends on a complex interaction between the catchment, the treatment area, atmosphere, vegetation, microbes and soil.
   We constructed a modeling tool (KUNTO) by integrating hydrological, ecological and water quality models. KUNTO describes a forested first-order catchment as a two-dimensional simplification (Fig. 1). The area of the first-order catchments may vary from tens of hectares to a few square kilometers. Boreal forested catchments usually contain upland mineral soil areas and peatland areas. Peatland areas can be ditched to enhance forest growth.
   The development of KUNTO aims at combining computation schemes that describe the most important processes controlling the N export from a catchment. The models associated with KUNTO describe hydrological processes above the soil surface and along the hillslope. Net primary production and litter input to soil are described for trees and ground vegetation. Decomposition of organic matter on upland mineral soil and on peatsoil are assessed with separate submodels. Nitrification, denitrification, N uptake and transport with surface and ground waters, retention of N in soils, immobilisation of N into litter and logging residues are also calculated. Water and N input from different parts of the catchment are fed into an outlet stream or ditch network, where erosion, transport of suspended solids and sedimentation are calculated. With KUNTO we can assess the impacts of cutting, site preparation, ditching and ditch network maintenance on N export to water bodies and on catchment N fluxes. Furthermore, we can assess efficiency of buffer zones and sedimentation ponds.
   [GRAPHICS]
   Figure 1. In KUNTO, the catchment is described as a two dimensional simplification: Upland mineral soil and pristine peatland areas form a hillslope extending from catchment border to the outlet. Ditched peatland areas are represented as single columns connected to the ditch network.

AB A steady state in soil carbon (C) requires that the production of organic C Compounds equal their losses through respiration and erosion. How accelerated rates of soil loss affect this balance in western rangelands, where rates of C accumulation without disturbance are relatively slow, is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of soil loss oil total, bare soil, and plant respiration rates at shortgrass prairie and sagebrush Steppe sites. The experimental design was a split-plot, randomized block, with a factorial arrangement of treatments. The factor levels consisted of 3 levels of soil removal (0, 11.2, and 22.4 t/ha) and 2 range condition classes (good and fair) with 3 replications each at the shortgrass site. Range condition class was not a factor considered at the sagebrush Site. Soil CO2 efflux was measured at weekly intervals during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons at the shortgrass site but only during the 2000 season at the sagebrush site. Total, bare soil, and plant respiration rates at the sagebrush site varied little (P > 0.10) among the 3 soil removal treatments. While total respiration at the shortgrass site increased significantly (P < 0.10) is soil removal level increased, bare soil respiration did not vary (P > 0.10) among the 3 soil removal levels. Plant respiration rates at the shortgrass site generally increased as soil removal level increased, but this response was affected by environmental factors that influenced plant productivity. Increased total respiration rates observed on the shortgrass prairie resulted primarily from increased plant respiration rather than from changes in bare soil respiration. Thus, changes in plant respiration following disturbance may be more important to total soil CO2 efflux than soil flora and faunal respiration that appeared to be more resistant to disturbance.

AB Patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) vary across the landscape leading to uncertainties in SOC budgets, especially for agricultural areas where water, wind, and tillage erosion redistribute soil and SOC. This study determined SOC patterns related to soil redistribution in small agricultural fields. Soil redistribution patterns were determined using the fallout caesium-137 technique in agricultural fields in Maryland and Iowa, USA. In two Iowa fields, SOC ranged from 0.5 to 5% whereas in the Maryland field the SOC ranged from 0.4 to 2.9%. Soil organic carbon was statistically significantly correlated with soil Cs-137 inventories and soil erosion/deposition rates. Sites of soil erosion in Iowa and Maryland had significantly lower average concentrations of SOC (2.4% and 1.3%, respectively) than sites of soil deposition (3.4% and 1.6%, respectively). These studies show the impact of soil redistribution patterns, within a field or catchment, and aid in understanding SOC patterns and budgets.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) data are presented from two long-term European experimental research sites: (i) SOM data from a soil conservation site in the U.K. and (ii) SOM data from a carbon sequestration benchmarking site in Lithuania. Detailed SOM information, which also incorporates soil organic carbon (SOC), is vitally important because it plays a fundamental role in both soil conservation and carbon sequestration studies. Land management of pedogenic carbon is a recognized means of improving soil fertility, reducing soil erosion rates, enhancing soil structural stability and promoting carbon sequestration. Therefore, its benefits extend from local to global scales. For instance, the first case study illustrates the environmental benefits of changes in SOM content before (as bare soil) and after (converted to grassland) the adoption of the soil conservation technique of set-aside. The second case study introduces various analytical approaches used to calculate SOM, and demonstrates the potential difficulty of international carbon benchmarking, as part of the global policy to ameliorate climate change.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between structural stability and water erosion in soils developed from acidic and carbonated materials. Soil properties that influence the formation of aggregates (texture, organic carbon content, nitrogen content etc.) were examined in surface horizons at water erosion-affected sites in Spain. Rainfall simulation experiments were also performed to explore the relationship between structural stability, runoff and soil loss.
   Soil loss was greater in soils developed from carbonated material. In acidic soils, the extra clay and nitrogen favoured structural stability. In carbonated soils, the extra silt decreased this stability. Rainfall simulations showed that slope and plant cover influence runoff, and soils with greater structural stability are subject to less soil loss.

AB We use C-org and delta(13)C to trace the origin of the alluvium deposited on the Waipaoa River floodplain at McPhail's Bend between 1853 and 2002. The overbank deposits exhibit a more positive range of delta(13)C values (-26.3 +/- 0.6) than contemporary suspended sediment in transport at intermediate flows (-27.8 +/- 0.2) when gully erosion releases most material to stream channels, reflecting the greater contribution made by shallow landsliding in the headwaters during large precipitation events. Overbank sediment associated with recent floods contains a higher (similar to50%) amount of organic carbon than alluvium deposited by pre-1927 floods, which was derived from outcrops of weathered bedrock on steep, riparian hillslopes that were the primary sediment source before the soil-mantled hillslopes elsewhere in the headwaters of the basin were destabilized by deforestation. The recent alluvium resembles the Bw horizon of soils present on these hillslopes. Sediment deposited during floods generated by localized storms and an overbank event that did not feature widespread shallow landsliding also has a distinctive signature that provides an indication of its provenance. The organic carbon associated with the alluvium appears to be old (4031 +/- 40 B.P., in the case of the carbon associated with sediment deposited in 2002) and to be derived from weathered Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary rocks.

AB Isoproturon and trifluralin are herbicides of contrasting chemical characters and modes of action. Standard batch sorption procedures were carried out to investigate the individual sorption behaviour of C-14-isoproturon and C-14-trifluralin in five agricultural soils (1.8-4.2% OC), and the soil solid-liquid partition coefficients (K-d values) were determined. Trifluralin exhibited strong partitioning to the soil solid phase (K-d range 106-294) and low desorption potential, thus should not pose a threat to sensitive waters via leaching, although particle erosion and preferential flow pathways may facilitate transport. For isoproturon, soil adsorption was low (K-d range 1.96-5.75) and desorption was high, suggesting a high leaching potential, consistent with isoproturon being the most frequently found pesticide in UK surface waters. Soil partitioning was directly related to soil organic carbon (OC) content. Accumulation isotherms were modelled using a dual-phase adsorption model to estimate adsorption and desorption rate coefficients. Associations between herbicides and soil humic substances were also shown using gel filtration chromatography. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) estimation at the landscape level is critical for assessing impacts of management practices on C sequestration and soil quality. We determined relationships between SOC.. terrain attributes. field scale soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil texture and soil survey map units in a 9 ha coastal plain field (Aquic and Typic Paleudults) historically man, P aged by conventional means. The site was composite sampled for SOC (0-30 cm) within 18.3 X 8.5-m grids (n = 496). and two data sets were created from the original data. Ordinary kriging. co-kriging, regression kriging and multiple regression were used to develop SOC surfaces that were validated with an independent data set (n = 24) using the mean square error (MSE). The SOC was relatively low (26.13 Mg ha(-1)) and only moderately variable (CV = 21%), and showed high spatial dependence. Interpolation techniques produced similar SOC maps but the best predictor was ordinary kriging (MSE = 9.11 Mg-2 ha(-2)) while regression was the worst (MSE = 20.65 Mg-2 ha(-2)). Factor analysis indicated that the first three factors explained 57% of field variability; compound topographic index (CTI), slope, EC and soil textural fractions dominated these components. Elevation, slope, CTI, silt content and EC explained up to 50% of the SOC variability (P less than or equal to 0.01) suggesting that topography and historical erosion played a significant role in SOC distribution. Field subdivision into soil map units or k-mean clusters similarly decreased SOC variance (about 30%). The study suggests that terrain attributes and EC surveys can be used to differentiate zones of variable SOC content. which may be used as bench marks to evaluate field-level impact of management practices on C sequestration.

AB Geochemical (elemental analysis, bulk delta(d1)3 C(TOC), thermal degradation techniques, molecular analysis of n-alkanes) and microscopic investigations (maceral analysis, vitrinite reflectance) were performed (1) to characterize the organic matter (OM) in sediments from two maar lakes in the Westeifel volcanic field, Germany, and (2) to discuss paleoenvironmental processes which have controlled the accumulation and preservation of OM. The annually laminated sediments show a wide range of organic carbon contents between 0.3 and 21.4% TOC and Hydrogen Index values between 80 and 501 mg HC/g TOC. Well-developed laminations mirror suboxic to anoxic bottom waters. Diagnostic compounds in the pyrolysates and microscopic analysis permit discrimination between the principal OM sources, and their variations over time provide important evidence for the reconstruction of the environmental histories of the lakes and their watershed. The significance of terrigenous OM is reflected by the occurrence of methoxyphenols in the insoluble as well as mid- and long-chain n-alkanes in the soluble OM which are indicative of land plant or macrophyte input to the lakes. The relative abundance of certain homologues together with the amount of terrigenous macerals can be used to show differences in higher plant input and vegetation changes through time. During the Pleniglacial and Younger Dryas period, high-reflecting reworked OM was introduced by soil erosion in an environment with relatively open vegetation. The alkylphenols in the pyrolysates originate partly from the microbial reworking of proteinaceous tyrosine moieties and/or reflect a direct contribution from cyanobacteria. We assume that variations in the carbon isotopic composition of OM are mainly due to changes in the lake's primary productivity with the exception of the Pleniglacial. Various forms of land use are reflected by increasing amounts of terrigenous particles as well as chemical plant markers from 500 varve years B. P. until present. The organic geochemical and microscopic data correlate well with other proxy information about climate-dependent fluctuations in the ecosystem of the studied sites.

AB Phosphorus transfer in runoff from intensive pasture systems has been extensively researched at a range of scales. However, integration of data from the range of scales has been limited. This paper presents a conceptual model of P transfer that incorporates landscape effects and reviews the research relating to P transfer at a range of scales in light of this model. The contribution of inorganic P sources to P transfer is relatively well understood, but the contribution of organic P to P transfer is still relatively poorly defined. Phosphorus transfer has been studied at laboratory, profile, plot, field, and watershed scales. The majority of research investigating the processes of P transfer (as distinct from merely quantifying P transfer) has been undertaken at the plot scale. However, there is a growing need to integrate data gathered at a range of scales so that more effective strategies to reduce P transfer can be identified. This has been hindered by the lack of a clear conceptual framework to describe differences in the processes of P transfer at the various scales. The interaction of hydrological (transport) factors with P source factors, and their relationship to scale, require further examination. Runoff-generating areas are highly variable, both temporally and spatially. Improvement in the understanding and identification of these areas will contribute to increased effectiveness of strategies aimed at reducing P transfers in runoff. A thorough consideration of scale effects using the conceptual model of P transfer outlined in this paper will facilitate the development of improved strategies for reducing P losses in runoff.

AB Problems of frequent drought stress, low soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, low aggregation, susceptibility to compaction, salinization and accelerated soil erosion in dry regions are accentuated by removal of crop residues, mechanical methods of seedbed preparation, summer clean fallowing and overgrazing, and excessive irrigation. The attendant soil degradation and desertification lead to depletion of SOC, decline in biomass production, eutrophication/pollution of waters and emission of greenhouse gases. Adoption of conservation agriculture, based on the use of crop residue mulch and no till farming, can conserve water, reduce soil erosion, improve soil structure, enhance SOC concentration, and reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2. The rate of SOC sequestration with conversion to conservation agriculture, elimination of summer fallowing and growing forages/cover crops may be 100 to 200 kg ha(-1) y(-1) in coarse-textured soils of semiarid regions and 150 to 300 kg ha(-1) y(-1) in heavy-textured soils of the subhumid regions. The potential of soil C sequestration in central Asia is 10 to 22 Tg C y(-1) (16 8 Tg C y(-1)) for about 50 years, and it represents 20 per cent of the CO2 emissions by fossil fuel combustion.

AB Water erosion extracts nutrients from farming areas and causes soil impoverishment and environmental contamination outside the erosion site. A rotating-boom rainfall simulator operated at a constant rainfall intensity of 64 mm h(-1) and 0.2083 MJ ha(-1) mm(-1) kinetic energy was used to investigate nutrient and organic carbon losses by water erosion and related parameters in six management systems in corn and bean crops. The experiments were carried out on a clayey loam structured soil (Hapludox) with 0.165 m m(-1) average slope on the Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, from March 2001 to April 2003. Three rainfall simulations were applied to the corn and three to the bean crop according to the following treatments: plowing + disking (bare soil) (SSC), corn and bean crop under plowing + disking on desiccated residue (PCO), corn and bean crop under no-tillage on desiccated residue on previously prepared soil (SDI), corn and bean crop under no-tillage on desiccated residue on never prepared soil (SDD), corn and bean crop under no-tillage on burned residue on never prepared soil (SDQ), and improved native pasture (CNM). Results showed that nutrients and organic carbon concentrations in runoff sediments were higher under conservation tillage than conventional tillage, while the total losses presented inverse behavior. In the water of the runoff, NH4+ and NO3 concentrations and losses were higher in the corn than in bean while P was lower. K concentrations were higher in corn and losses lower. Soil impoverishment rates were generally close to the unit for nutrients and organic carbon. Nutrients and organic carbon concentrations in erosion sediments were linearly and positively correlated with the chemical composition of the 0-0. 025 m soil layer.

AB Controlled studies to investigate the interaction between crop growth, soil properties, hydrology, and management practices are common in agronomy. These sites (much as with real world farmland) often have complex management histories and topographic variability that must be considered. In 1993 an interdisiplinary study was started for a 20-ha site in Beltsville, MD. Soil cores (271) were collected in 1999 in a 30-m grid (with 5-m nesting) and analyzed as part of the site characterization. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and (137)Cesium (Cs-137) were measured. Analysis of aerial photography from 1992 and of farm management records revealed that part of the site had been maintained as a swine pasture and the other portion as cropped land. Soil properties, particularly soil redistribution and SOC, show large differences in mean values between the two areas. Mass C is 0.8 kg m(-2) greater in the pasture area than in the cropped portion. The pasture area is primarily a deposition site, whereas the crop area is dominated by erosion. Management influence is suggested, but topographic variability confounds interpretation. Soil organic carbon is spatially structured, with a regionalized variable of 120 m. Cs-137 activity lacks spatial structure, suggesting disturbance of the profile by animal activity and past structures such as swine shelters and roads. Neither SOC nor Cs-137 were strongly correlated to terrain parameters, crop yields, or a seasonal soil moisture index predicted from crop yields. SOC and Cs-137 were weakly correlated (r(2) similar to0.2, F-test P-value 0.001), suggesting that soil transport controls, in part, SOC distribution. The study illustrates the importance of past site history when interpreting the landscape distribution of soil properties, especially those strongly influenced by human activity. Confounding variables, complex soil hydrology, and incomplete documentation of land use history make definitive interpretations of the processes behind the spatial distributions difficult. Such complexity may limit the accuracy of scaling approaches to mapping SOC and soil redistribution.

AB The question of discriminating sources of organic matter in suspended sediment transported by streams can be addressed by using total organic carbon concentration and stable isotope (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) measurements when constant fluxes of organic matter supply can be assumed. However, little is known about the dynamics of organic matter release during soil erosion and the temporal stability of its isotopic composition. In this study, we have monitored soil organic carbon loss and water runoff using natural rainfall events during the 1998 rainy season on three experimental field plots with different vegetation covers (bare, maize and coffee plots), set up on slopes of a tropical mountainous watershed in NW Venezuela (Bocono watershed, 08degrees57' -09degrees31' N, 70degrees02' -70degrees34' W). Runoff and soil organic carbon losses were considerably higher for the bare field plot than for the cultivated field plots (270 and 2.2-21.0 kg C ha(-1), respectively), and these findings are consistent with other soil erosion experiments. Total organic carbon concentrations, total nitrogen concentrations and the 613 C and 615 N composition of fine (<50 mum) size suspended sediments remain constant for high runoff periods (>30 ml s(-1)) and "high" suspended matter concentrations (>0.5 g l(-1)), closely reflecting the composition of soil organic matter from which they originate and integrating the high variability of organic carbon in top soil horizons. Because runoff and soil organic carbon loss are closely linked during most of the water flow (at the time scales covered by this study), the contribution of soil organic matter, originating from soils with different compositions, to suspended sediments in runoff can be derived using soil organic carbon erosion rates and stable (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) isotope measurements.

AB The observed and projected increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming and sea level rise, have raised interests in identifying mitigation options. Terrestrial C sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. Losses of C from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation, biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture, and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert carbon with long residence time. Practices that enhance C sequestration include afforestation and reforestation, conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and adopting systems with high biodiversity. Net C sequestration within an ecosystem can be assessed by taking into account the hidden C costs of fertilizers, pesticides, tillage, irrigation and other input. Restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems has a vast potential of C sequestration. The Kyoto Protocol provides for C sequestration in terrestrial sinks and C trading through Clean Development Mechanisms. Terrestrial C sequestration, besides being a win-win strategy, offers a window of opportunity for the first few decades of the 21(st) century. It is a natural process of reducing the rates of gaseous emissions while alternatives to fossil fuel take effect.

AB We reviewed the factors and processes relevant to C (Carbon) stocks and dynamics in the soils of Hindu Kush-Himalayan region (HKH) in general, and Nepal in particular. Included in this paper are reviews of land use change, soil types, erosion, soil fertility status, land management and other pertinent information in relation to the SOC (Soil Organic Carbon) stock, dynamics and sequestration. Watershed degradation in the HKH region appears to be a serious problem affecting the SOC pool, which may be primarily attributed to deforestation, land use changes, forest degradation, soil erosion and fertility decline. Soils under degraded forest and grazing land and red soils were reported to have less than 1% SOC; however, well managed forests have considerably higher organic matter (SOC 4%) levels than those cleared for cultivation. Our estimates show that both the soil and SOC losses are site specific, being as high as 256 kg C ha(-1) y(-1). Estimated net CO(2) losses from the erosion displaced SOC varied between <1 and 42 kg C ha(-1) y(-1) depending on initial SOC content and soil erosion rates in the specific sites. The land cover changes in the past 18 years in the two Nepalese watersheds, Mardi and Fewa, may have resulted in net loss of SOC stock (29% losses for Mardi and 7% losses for Fewa) compared to land cover in the base year (1978). The processes contributing to C pool, fluxes and sequestration are inadequately studied, and particularly in the HKH region, there is a lack of data on several essential aspects needed for estimating soil C fluxes and C sequestration potential. Systematic soil survey and long term experiments are needed on dominant soil types and land use systems of the HKH region for developing the database on soil fertility and SOC relationships to site specific management practices. Future research should focus upon generating data on spatial and temporal variation, depth distribution, quantification of various pools, and transport/translocation of SOC, as well as the establishment of soil/SOC databases, in relation to specific land use and management practices.

AB The Twenhafel Mound, a Middle Mississippian burial mound in Jackson County, Illinois, was most likely built between A.D. 500 and A.D. 900. The existence of the mound has been known since the French settled in the nearby town of Cahokia in 1699. Since the time of European settlement, the mound has not been legally protected from treasure hunters. The land was privately purchased and settled in the 1850s. Many similar and adjacent mounds were excavated in a search for treasure or artifacts, leveled for farming, or hauled away. The primary objectives of this research are to determine the extent and time of mixing by excavation and/or tillage, the source of the mound materials, and the rate of diagnostic soil horizon formation. Fly ash was used as a time indicator. The depth of fly ash in the soil on the summit of the mound is consistent with the soil being tilled and mixed to a 40-cm depth. The sideslope of the mound has a similar significant depth of occurrence but has a higher amount of fly ash in the surface layer, suggesting that some tillage translocation and erosion of the summit soil has resulted in deposition on the sideslope. The soil developed in the alluvial fan adjacent to the mound has a similar texture and supports the theory that the mound was constructed from soil materials obtained from this alluvial fan rather than the theory that earth was carried from the adjacent bluffs formed in loess. Radiocarbon analysis of charcoal and organic matter found in the 80 to 130-cm layer suggests that 99% of the carbon is modern (<100 yrs old), which is consistent with the findings that trace amounts of fly ash in the layer were most likely moved into the layer by late historical human excavations and/or bioturbation.

AB In the central highlands of Mexico, mesquite (Prosopis laevigata) and huisache (Acacia schaffneri), N-2-fixing trees or shrubs, dominate the vegetation and are currently used in a reforestation program to prevent erosion. We investigated how natural vegetation or cultivation of soil affected oxidation of CH4, and production of N2O. Soil was sampled under the canopy of mesquite (MES treatment) and huisache trees (HUI treatment), outside their canopy (OUT treatment) and from fields cultivated with maize (ARA treatment) at three different sites while production of CO2, and dynamics of CH4, N2O and inorganic N (NH4+, and NO3-) were monitored in an aerobic incubation. The production of CO2 was 2.3 times higher and significantly greater in the OUT treatment, 3.0 times higher in the MES treatment and 4.0 times higher in the HUI treatment compared to the ARA treatment. There was no significant difference in oxidation of CH4 between the treatments, which ranged from 0.019 mug CH4-C kg(-1) day(-1) for the HUI treatment to 0.033 CH4-C kg(-1) day(-1) for the MES treatment. The production of N2O was 30 mug N2O-N kg(-1) day(-1) in the MES treatment and >8 times higher compared to the other treatments. The average concentration of NO3- was 2 times higher and significantly greater in the MES treatment than in the HUI treatment, 3 times greater than in the OUT treatment and 10 times greater than in the ARA treatment. It was found that cultivation of soil decreased soil organic matter content, C and N mineralization, but not oxidation of CH4 or production of N2O.

AB Many processes contribute to nutrient transfer from terrestrial to aquatic systems, but in most cases the contribution of particular organisms is unknown. In this study, we explore how a Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP) produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may provide nutrients to river ecosystems. Along a floodplain in Montana, we extracted BRSP from soils and related the protein concentrations to the age of soil surfaces. We identified BRSP in surface soils, as well as to a depth of 1.4 m, and found that the protein accumulates through time. We also detected BRSP in foam from five rivers in the western United States. Experiments were conducted that demonstrate that the protein may be leached or washed from soils and become a constituent of foam when mixed into turbulent water. We propose that terrestrially derived soil protein may enter rivers via erosion and leaching and serve as a nutrient source for aquatic organisms.

AB This manuscript is a synthesis of the available information on energy use in farm operations, and its conversion into carbon equivalent (CE). A principal advantage of expressing energy use in terms of carbon (C) emission as kg CE lies in its direct relation to the rate of enrichment of atmospheric concentration of CO2. Synthesis of the data shows that estimates of emissions in kg CE/ha are 2-20 for different tillage operations, 1-1.4 for spraying chemicals, 2-4 for drilling or seeding and 6-12 for combine harvesting. Similarly, estimates of C emissions in kg CE/kg for different fertilizer nutrients are 0.9-1.8 for N, 0.1-0.3 for P2O5, 0.1-0.2 for K2O and 0.03-0.23 for lime. Estimates of C emission in kg CE/kg of active ingredient (a.i.) of different pesticides are 6.3 for herbicides, 5.1 for insecticides and 3.9 for fungicides. Irrigation, lifting water from deep wells and using sprinkling systems, emits 129 98 kg CE for applying 25 cm of water and 258 +/- 195 for 50 cm of water. Emission for different tillage methods are 35.3 kg CE/ha for conventional till, 7.9 kg CE/ha for chisel till or minimum till, and 5.8 kg CE/ha for no-till method of seedbed preparation. In view of the high C costs of major inputs, sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems implies that an output/input ratio, expressed either as gross or net output of C, must be >1 and has an increasing trend over time.

AB Tendency to crust is a potentially useful index for assessing soil degradation and for assisting land use planning in South Africa. In this study, the influence of land use, geology and vegetation cover on the tendency of soil to form a surface crust was investigated in six vegetation types. Crusting at all sites was greater in exposed soils than soils under vegetation, as determined by infiltration rate, water dispersible clay and modulus of rupture. In Renosterveld, crusting was markedly greater in exposed soil than vegetation covered soil (mean infiltration 16 vs 44 mm h(-1); dispersible clay 2.6 vs 2.2%; modulus of rupture 121 vs 64 kPa). Greater crusting in exposed soil was attributed to lower soluble salt and labile carbon (C) contents and an associated increase in the dispersion of clay. In Karoo, crusting of exposed, shale-derived soils was greater than that of exposed, dolerite-derived soils (infiltration 40 vs 83 mm h(-1); dispersible clay 2 vs 1.2%), and a similar pattern was evident in Tall Grassveld (infiltration 18 vs 36 mm h(-1); dispersible clay 1.2 vs 0.9%; modulus of rupture 31 vs 21 kPa). In Upland Grassland, cultivation of maize and rye enhanced crusting. In Thicket, crusting was greater in soils from open, degraded vegetation than intact, densely wooded sites (infiltration 19 vs 51 mm h(-1); modulus of rupture 16 vs 34 kPa), probably due to lower content of soil C. In Bushveld, crusting was greater in annually burnt plots than unburnt plots (infiltration 109 vs 163 mm h(-1); dispersible clay 0.9 vs 0.6% on granite-derived soils; and infiltration 56 vs 72 mm h(-1); dispersible clay 1.5 vs 1.3% on basalt-derived soils). Greater crusting of soil from burnt plots was ascribed to a reduction in soil C and soluble salts as well as a greater exchangeable sodium percentage.

AB Vineyards in Champagne, France are generally situated on slopes where the soils are subject to erosion. Therefore it is important to find a soil-surface management practice that protects the soil against water erosion. We assessed the potential of mulches or grass covers to stabilize soil aggregates in a calcareous sandy loam from a vineyard in Champagne after 9 years under different management systems. Four different treatments were studied: (i) a bluegrass (Poa pratensis) surface cover between the vine rows (GC) with bare soil under the vines (R); two organic mulches of (ii) coniferous (CB) or (iii) poplar (PB) bark that covered the entire soil surface, and (iv) bare soil between the rows as a control. The bark amendments were applied every 3 years at rates of 61 and 67 t ha(-1) for the PB and CB treatments, respectively. The kinetics of soil disaggregation in water fitted a power law (A=K t(-D)), in which K was the fraction of water-stable >200 mum aggregates remaining after 1 hour of wet-sieving. In the 0-5 cm layer, aggregate stability was greater for GC (K=21.7), CB (K=15.2) and PB (K=13.6) than for the control (K=10.5) and R (K=11.8). In the 0-20 cm layer, CB also stabilized soil aggregates (K=14.0-15.0); but PB did not. Structural stability was more strongly related to total organic carbon (R-2=0.64, P <0.001) than to microbial biomass carbon (R-2=0.54, P<0.001). A bluegrass cover enhanced structural stability in the 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm layers (K=14.2), probably because of intense root development and rhizodeposition enhancing microbially produced metabolites, such as carbohydrates. Establishing grass cover or applying bark mulch are effective agricultural practices that improve soil aggregate stability and thus should reduce soil erosion. The vegetative growth of the vines was greater on the soils amended with bark mulches and less on the grass covered soils compared with the control soil; however, no difference in wine quality was observed among the different treatments.

AB This article reports the discovery of numerous subaerial exposure surfaces which occur in the ca. 2200 Ma Kuetsjdrvi Sedimentary Formation (KSF) from the Pechenga Greenstone Belt, NE Fennoscandian Shield, Russia. The formation was accumulated within an intraplate rift and is composed of fluviatile-deltaic siliciclastic deposits and lacustrine dolostones. The dolostones are enriched in C-13 (delta(13)C = +6.6 to +7.6parts per thousand V-PDB, delta(18)O = 16.7 to 21.5parts per thousand V-SMOW), which is, in general, assigned to a global perturbation of the carbon cycle. The lacustrine dolostone unit contains desiccated and in situ brecciated carbonate beds, subaerial erosion and dissolution surfaces, epikarst, surficial silicification (silcretes) and hot-water spring travertines. The dissolution surfaces-marked by formation of a few centimetre thick, 'vuggy', non-laminated, dolomicrite capped by silicified nodular zone-resemble modem calcretes which formed by capillary rise of surface waters (per-ascensum calcrete) following saturation of the regolith zone under and or semi-arid conditions. Abundant red, iron-stained, superficial dolocrete implies the existence of an O-2-rich atmosphere. Rezolith, 'black pebbles', alveolar septal structures, Microcodium' and other fabrics associated with plant roots and input of terrestrial organic matter, which are typical for post-Cretaceous pedogenic calcretes, have not been identified. Alfa fabrics can be applied to describe dolocretes though rhombic calcite crystals are lacking. Neither C-13-depletion nor C-13-enrichment has been documented in the dolocrete, which suggests no contribution Of CO2 derived from soil or from any other C-org-rich sources enriched in 12 C, and apparent lack of biological uptake of 12 C during formation of the dolocrete. Both petrographic and carbon isotope data do not support earlier assertions that Palaeoproterozoic subaerial surface was colonised by microbial mats. A few samples have high delta(18)O values (up to 30parts per thousand) despite diagenetic and metamorphic resetting of the oxygen isotope system, suggesting evaporation during formation of the superficial dolocrete. Such documented episodes of subaerial exposure, formation of hot-water travertines, superficial dolocrete and silcrete suggest that there must have been frequent decoupling between the Kuetsjarvi depositional system and the bordering sea. This imposes an additional restriction on the use of the isotopic composition of the KSF dolostones for reconstruction of the delta(13)C(arb) global secular curve. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lower Cretaceous synrift lacustrine shales from the Congo Basin, west Africa, have been analyzed with sedimentological and geo-chemical techniques to characterize source rock quality and identify triggers for deposition of intervals richest in organic carbon. The sequence includes a lower active rift section, deposited during active faulting and subsidence, overlain by an upper late rift section, deposited during reduced faulting and subsidence.
   Total organic carbon (TOC) averages 2 - 3 wt. % throughout the active rift siliciclastic shale section, 6% in marls in the lower part of the late rift section, and 1-2% in deltaic shales in the upper part of the late rift section. Organic matter consists of mixed types I and III kerogen in the active rift shales, pure type I kerogen in the late rift marls, and a type I and III mixture in the late rift deltaic shales.
   Redox proxies indicate that the deep lake was relatively reducing throughout deposition of the active rift and lower late rift sections. Therefore, enhanced anoxia did not trigger deposition of the richest source rocks. Decreased sedimentation rates in the late rift do not account for the full increase in TOC nor the shift on organic matter type. The richest source rocks are associated with high rates of organic productivity and chemical sedimentation, indicating that flux of dissolved components to the rift lake, including nutrients for algae growth, was critical. We propose that reduced topography associated with the late rift was necessary for efficient cycling of plant-derived carbon into soil carbonate and ultimately the rift lake, and for enhancing chemical weathering and nutrient flux.

AB New Zealand is currently identifying and quantifying its carbon sources and sinks to develop a national carbon budget. This will enable it to set policy and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Kyoto Protocol. While soil is a major carbon sink, New Zealand also has high sediment yields to the ocean, suggesting that erosion has a significant effect on soil carbon fluxes, through CO(2) emission during transport of carbon in sediment, carbon burial and recovery of carbon on eroded areas.
   As a contribution to the national carbon budget, a mass balance approach was used to calculate soil carbon fluxes from landslide and sheetwash erosion in the Tutira catchment in the North Island of New Zealand. This soft rock hill country catchment represents the upper limit for landslide-related soil carbon losses. It contains a lake that acts as a highly efficient trap for sediment and nutrients, and has preserved a high-resolution record of storm-induced erosion. Information from previous studies of erosion and lake sedimentation was used to construct a carbon budget for the 114-year period of European pastoral farming. The budget assumes the gross transfer of carbon by geomorphological processes and does not include biogeochemical exchanges with the atmosphere.
   Results indicate that 0.94+/-0.23 Mg C ha(-1) per year enter the lake (0.50+/-0.15 Mg C ha(-1) per year from landslide erosion and 0.44+/-0.17 Mg C ha(-1) per year from sheetwash erosion). On a national scale this equates to an anthropogenically induced loss of 2 112 000 Mg C per year from the 10% of similar terrain under pastoral land use. However, the net loss from the landscape is significantly less due to carbon recovery on eroded sites. Landslide scars have a carbon recovery rate (after oxidation) of similar to0.61 Mg C ha(-1) per year. Carbon recovery on areas affected solely by sheetwash erosion was not measured, but is significantly lower. This information is being used to constrain models of erosion-related carbon fluxes developed for landslide-prone terrains, as part of the national carbon budget. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB A freshwater reservoir (area: 122 km(2), volume: 2850 x 101 m(3), maximum depth: 72 m) located at the outlet of a tropical Andean watershed (Rio Bocono, 1620 km(2), 08degrees57'-09degrees31'N, 70degrees02'-70degrees34'W, NW Venezuela) was studied combining: (1) high resolution monitoring of the major environmental parameters using a CTD probe; (2) dissolved (major and trace) element concentration measurements; (3) water (delta(18)O, delta(2)H) isotope measurements and; (4) organic carbon (C) concentration - delta(13)C measurements on suspended matter and on sediments. Composed of two sub-reservoirs with contrasted water inputs, the Pe (n) over tildea Larga dam provides the opportunity to better constrain C budgets and source - composition of suspended organic matter within two parts of a unique freshwater system with contrasted redox conditions. The redox status is reflected by drastic differences between the two parts of the reservoir, pictured by water residence time, water column ventilation, dissolved trace element concentration and suspended organic matter composition. Seasonal renewal of water near the main inlet supports higher surface productivity, oxic water column conditions, homogenous water chemical composition and, below the thermocline, the transport of suspended organic matter mainly derived from soil erosion on the watershed. Calculated sediment and organic C storages amount to 5.6 x 10(6) t a(-1) and 21 +/- 5 x 10(3) t C a(-1), respectively. Despite a markedly lower suspended sediment load, Outflow waters exhibit POC-delta(13)C values similar to those in inflow waters, due to a short water residence time and a rapid recycling of primary products. In the more isolated parts of the reservoir, where water discharge is thoroughly reduced, hypoxic to anoxic conditions are found immediately below the thermocline (ca. 16 m, [O-2]<30 mumol L-1). They induce a correlative increase of trace element concentrations with water depth. Suspended organic matter display C-13-depleted compositions, contrasting sharply with that of photosynthetic organisms and land-derived detritus, that either reflect the contribution of microbial biomass (chemoautotrophic and/or methanotrophic bacteria) or the selective degradation of more labile organic compounds in the water column. The hypoxic to anoxic conditions displayed in the major part of the water column extend to the first cm of lake bottom sediments. A simplified budget based on the main redox processes active in the hypolimnion and on average water residence times, supports drastic differences in mineralization rate: 83-444 mumol C L-1 a(-1) for the oxic reservoir and only 43 mumol C L-1 a(-1) for the hypoxic to anoxic reservoir. This study shows that, if water renewal is not sufficient, tropical freshwater lakes may be subject to severe dissolved O-2 depletion conditions at shallow depths, comparable to those observed in deep sections of the water column of temperate eutrophic lakes.

AB Fossil fuel emissions of carbon (C) in China in 2000 was about 1 Pg/yr, which may surpass that of the U.S. (1.84 Pg C) by 2020. Terrestrial C pool of China comprises about 35 to 60 Pg in the forest and 120 to 186 Pg in soils. Soil degradation is a major issue affecting 145 Mha by different degradative processes, of which 126 Mha are prone to accelerated soil erosion. Similar to world soils, agricultural soils of China have also lost 30 to 50% or more of the antecedent soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Some of the depleted SOC pool can be re-sequestered through restoration of degraded soils, and adoption of recommended management practices. The latter include conversion of upland crops to multiple cropping and rice paddies, adoption of integrated nutrient management (INM) strategies, incorporation of cover crops in the rotations cycle and adoption of conservation-effective systems including conservation tillage. A crude estimated potential of soil C sequestration in China is 119 to 226 Tg C/y of SOC and 7 to 138 Tg C/y for soil inorganic carbon (SIC) up to 50 years. The total potential of soil C sequestration is about 12 Pg, and this potential can offset about 25% of the annual fossil fuel emissions in China.

AB With a large land area and diverse ecoregions, there is a considerable potential of terrestrial/soil carbon sequestration in India. Of the total land area of 329 million hectares (Mha), 297 Mha is the land area comprising 162 Mha of arable land, 69 Mha of forest and woodland, 11 Mha of permanent pasture, 8 Mha of permanent crops and 58 Mha is other land uses. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is estimated at 21 Pg (petagram=Pg=1x10(15) g=billion ton) to 30- cm depth and 63 Pg to 150-cm depth. The soil inorganic carbon (SIC) pool is estimated at 196 Pg to 1-m depth. The SOC concentration in most cultivated soils is less than 5 g/kg compared with 15 to 20 g/kg in uncultivated soils. Low SOC concentration is attributed to plowing, removal of crop residue and other biosolids, and mining of soil fertility. Accelerated soil erosion by water leads to emission of 6 Tg C/y. Important strategies of soil C sequestration include restoration of degraded soils, and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) of agricultural and forestry soils. Potential of soil C sequestration in India is estimated at 7 to 10 Tg C/y for restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems, 5 to 7 Tg C/y for erosion control, 6 to 7 Tg C/y for adoption of RMPs on agricultural soils, and 22 to 26 Tg C/y for secondary carbonates. Thus, total potential of soil C sequestration is 39 to 49 (44+/-5) Tg C/y.

AB Carbon sequestration, the conversion of greenhouse gas CO2 to organic matter, offers a powerful tool with which to combat climate change. The enlargement of carbon sinks stored in soil and biota is an essential tool in buying time while mankind seeks means to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to reduce the elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. Carbon sequestration within the context of the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also has great potential as an incentive for combating land degradation and desertification and restoring fertility to degraded land. Decisions regarding carbon sinks during finalization of the operational details of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 fit well the needs of countries facing land degradation and desertification. However, incentives for such mitigation through the Clean Development Mechanism of the protocol are limited to forestry issues. Iceland provides a good example of the multiple role of carbon sequestration in meeting national commitments to UNFCCC, conserving and restoring biological diversity, combating soil erosion, revegetation of eroded land and reforestation. Linking carbon sequestration with such goals has resulted in increased funds for soil conservation and restoration of degraded land in Iceland.

AB A first assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss mechanisms due to water erosion in Canary Islands andosols has been carried out. The study has been performed in experimental erosion plots. The soils are classified as Fulvic Andosols or Ultic Fulvudands. The mean soil loss by interrill erosion is 9.6 t ha(-1) year(-1), with a runoff percentage of 13% and a rain erosivity index, according to USLE's R factor of 640 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1). The andosols studied here show organic carbon (OC) contents of 120 +/- 1.5 g kg(-1) in the first 5 cm of surface soil, equivalent to a surface content of 2.4 x 10(3) g m(-2) OC. A 73.3 +/- 0.7% of this carbon occurs as allophane-Al-humus or Al-humus complexes (Cpy), 2.6 +/- 0.1% as Cps, 0.1% as dissolved soil organic carbon (DSOC) and the remainder in other nonextractable forms. The measured values of eroded OC in sediments range 116 +/- 18.1 g kg(-1), implying losses of OC bonded to the solid phase of 114.4 g m(-2) year(-1) C, whereas the concentration of OC in runoff water was 12 +/- 13.6 mg l(-1), involving flows of DSOC equal to 1.03 g m(-2) year(-1) C. Regardless of the aggregate size fraction eroded, the lowest enrichment ratios (ERs) are produced for the Cpy (ER = 0.70-0.74), whereas the highest ERs have been found in the smallest-sized aggregate fractions (ER = 0.74-1.22) for all forms of eroded OC. The chemical stabilization of pyrophosphate-extractable forms (Cpy) in the smallest aggregates seems to be the main mechanism of carbon sequestration in these andosols. Moreover, the predominance of nonpyrophosphate-extractable forms in the sediments leads to the assumption that the eroded SOC might be a source of atmospheric CO(2), although further research is necessary about the susceptibility of these OC forms to mineralization in areas that are ecologically different from those in which they originated.

AB Xeric succulent thicket in the Eastern Cape, South Africa has been used for farming goats since the early 1900s. This habitat is characterised by a dense cover of the succulent bush Portulacaria afra and by a warm, semi-arid climate with evenly distributed annual rainfall of 250-400 mm. Heavy browsing by goats results in the loss of R afra and transforms the thicket to an open savanna dominated by annual grasses. Eight fence-line comparisons between thicket and savanna were used to investigate differences in soil quality associated with the vegetation change. Composite soil samples were taken to a depth of 10 cm from 1 ha plots on either side of the fence-line. Associated with the change from thicket to savanna, a significant decrease (paired t-test, P < 0.05) was found in total C (respective means of 5.6 vs. 3.0%), total N (0.33 vs. 0.24%), labile C (2.8 vs. 1.5%), CO(2) flux (1-9 vs 0.5 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), soil respiration in the laboratory (144 vs. 79 ng C kg(-1) s(-1)), (NH(4))OAc-extractable Mg (55 vs. 28 mmol(c) kg(-1)), and laboratory infiltration rate (51 vs. 19 mm h(-1)). In the same direction there was a similarly significant increase in modulus of rupture (16 vs. 34 kPa), water-soluble Ca (2.3 vs. 3.4 mmol(c) kg(-1)) and pH (6.7 vs. 7.7). The soil C content of 5.6% in thicket is surprisingly high in this warm, semi-arid climate and suggests that the dense P afra bush strongly regulates soil organic matter through microclimate, erosion control, litter quantity and perhaps chemistry. Savanna soils had a greater tendency to crust (as evident in a lower rate of laboratory infiltration and greater modulus of rupture) than thicket soils. This was attributed to their lower organic matter content, which probably reduced aggregate stability. Savannas are likely to be more prone to runoff and erosion not only because of sparser vegetation but also because of a decline in soil quality.

AB Soil erosion affects soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics by redistributing SOC within the watershed or ecosystem and by altering the C release rate into the atmosphere. Although the mechanism of this process is poorly understood it has the potential to influence global climate.
   Crosby loam soil (fine, mixed, mesic, Aeric Ochraqualfs) was used in a laboratory rainfall simulation to quantify erosion-induced CO2 evolution from the soil surface, distribution of SOC in various aggregate fractions, and SOC preferential transport. The soil was placed in five plots (0.15 X 0.3 X I m) positioned at different slopes (8, 7, 1, 0.5, and 0%) and connected in a cascade fashion so that the runoff from one plot was diverted to the top of the next plot. This setup allowed collection of runoff samples at various distances along the slope while the soil was detached, transported, sorted, and deposited. The soil was subjected to simulated rainfall at 80 rum h(-1) for 1.5 h. Runoff samples were collected from each of the plots every 10 min. and separated on four aggregate fractions. Core samples were extracted and placed in incubation chambers in such a way that only the original undisturbed soil surface was exposed. Evolution of CO2 from the core samples and runoff sediment was monitored and total SOC content determined. Sediment balance at different locations on the slope varied from 1307 g m(-2) to 980 g m(-2). SOC loss occurred through increased erosion-induced mineralization and preferential transport by runoff. CO2 emission from the deposition areas (17.0 g C m(-2) during a 60-day period) was 26% higher than at the control site, whereas the emissions from the eroded site and the control site were the same. Increased CO2 release from deposited sediments was related to their aggregate composition. Sediment consisted largely of aggregates 0.053 to 1 mm in diameter, increasing (15 to 50% compared with original soil) with SOC content. The carbon mineralization rate (0.07 g C kg(-1) soil d(-1)) ranging from 0.053 to 0.25 mm fractions, was 2 to 4 times greater than that from larger (0.25-1) and smaller (<0.053 mm) fractions during the initial 20 days of incubation. This was attributed not only to increased labile SOC content in the medium aggregate fractions but also to the substantial amount of medium size aggregates formed by the breakup of larger aggregates, thus providing the bacteria access to otherwise physically protected organic compounds. The enrichment ratio of SOC in runoff varied from 1.0 to 1.7, increasing with slope length and decreasing with rainfall duration.

AB We studied the changes in soil properties after afforestation on desertification-affected sandy soils to estimate how much time would be required for soils to recover enough for use in sustainable food production. We surveyed soils near and within 3-, 9-, and 19-year-old plantations of poplar (Poplus simonii) in the central part of Naiman County, east,ern Inner Mongolia, China. Changes in the soil properties following afforestation included an accumulation of fine particles (clay + silt) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the surface horizons. The contents of fine particles and SOC increased slowly in the first 9-year period and then rapidly between 10 and 19 years, being higher at concave than convex sites. Soil parameters such as available moisture level, amounts of available N and available P, and CEC that control soil fertility showed a similar trend to that of the contents of fine particles and SOC. The contents of fine particles and SOC were higher at the windward edge than in the center of the 19-year-old poplar plantation, suggesting that the accumulation of fine particles was caused by the decrease in wind velocity due to the presence of vegetation. The increase in the SOC content may be caused by the increased carbon input to soils from the vegetation and by the deposition of fine particles with a higher C concentration than that of native sandy soils. Soil fertility, represented by the amounts of available N in the upper 20 cm layer. of the soil, recovered after 19 years under poplars, and was similar to that of adjacent fertile cropland. However, the amount of available N under plantations younger than 10 years was lower than that in cropland soils, suggesting that a period of between 10 and 20 years is required for soils to recover from desertified conditions and be utilized for intensive crop farming once again.

AB The extreme climate of the northern Great Plains of North America requires cropping systems to possess a resilient soil resource in order to be sustainable. This paper summarizes the interactive effects of tillage, crop sequence, and cropping intensity on soil quality indicators for two long-term cropping system experiments in the northern Great Plains. The experiments, located in central North Dakota, were established in 1984 and 1993 on a Wilton silt loam (FAO: Calcic Siltic Chernozem; USDA(1): fine-silty, mixed, superactive frigid Pachic Haplustoll). Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties considered as indicators of soil quality were evaluated in spring 2001 in both experiments at depths of 0-7.5, 7.5-15, and 15-30 cm. Management effects on soil properties were largely limited to the surface 7.5 cm in both experiments. For the experiment established in 1984, differences in soil condition between a continuous crop, no-till system and a crop-fallow, conventional tillage system were substantial. Within the surface 7.5 cm, the continuous crop, no-till system possessed significantly more soil organic C (by 7.28 Mg ha(-1)), particulate organic matter C (POM-C) (by 4.98 Mg ha(-1)), potentially mineralizable N (PMN) (by 32.4 kg ha(-1)), and microbial biomass C (by 586 kg ha(-1)), as well as greater aggregate stability (by 33.4%) and faster infiltration rates (by 55.6 cm h(-1)) relative to the crop-fallow, conventional tillage system. Thus, soil from the continuous crop, no-till system was improved with respect to its ability to provide a source for plant nutrients, withstand erosion, and facilitate water transfer. Soil properties were affected less by management practices in the experiment established in 1993, although organic matter related properties tended to be greater under continuous cropping or minimum tillage than crop sequences with fallow or no-till. In particular, PMN and microbial biomass C were greatest in continuous spring wheat (with residue removed) (22.5 kg ha(-1) for PMN; 792 kg ha(-1) for microbial biomass Q as compared with sequences with fallow (SW-S-F and SW-F) (Average = 15.9 kg ha(-1) for PMN; 577 kg ha(-1) for microbial biomass Q. Results from both experiments confirm that farmers in the northern Great Plains of North America can improve soil quality and agricultural sustainability by adopting production systems that employ intensive cropping practices with reduced tillage management.

AB Knowledge of the long-term effects of tillage on soil organic carbon is important to our understanding of sustainable agricultural systems and global carbon cycles. In landscapes susceptible to erosion, tillage can exacerbate losses of soil and C by increasing erodibility and stimulating microbial respiration. We measured long-term changes in soil carbon and soil loss in three small watersheds located in southwest Iowa, USA. The following soil series were formed on deep loess hills: Ida and Dow (Typic Udorthents), Napier and Kennebec (Cumulic Hapludolls) and Monona (Typic Hapludolls). All watersheds were cropped to continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and two were moldboard plowed and disk tilled while the third was ridge-tilled. The ridge-tillage system had greater C contents in the surface soil than the disk tillage soils, but ridge-tillage was not different from the conventional tillage in carbon retention over time. The ridge-tillage system, however, was more effective in retaining soil within the watershed. Microbial respiration by soil microorganisms accounted for 97% of the carbon loss in the ridge-tilled watershed compared to carbon loss in eroded sediment (3%). Terrain analysis was used to segment the landscape into landform elements. Less total carbon was present in the soil profiles of backslope elements than in footslope or toeslope elements, reflecting the combined effects of soil erosion and deposition within the watersheds. Profile C content was also positively correlated with the wetness index, a compound topographic attribute, that identifies areas of the landscape where runoff water and sediment accumulate.

AB Abandonment of terraced soils and increased brushland cover has increased wildfire occurrence to almost an annual rate in the Cap de Creus Peninsula, NE Pyrenees Range, Province of Girona, Spain. A wildfire occurred in August 2000 and affected an area of 6760 ha of shrubs and cork trees, whereas still cultivated plots were only slightly affected. Five stations of erosion measurements, corresponding to five different environments (from present cultivation to late abandonment) were destroyed by the passage of fire, and were promptly replaced to allow to monitoring post-fire effects on soil erosion. Selected soil properties were determined monthly before the fire and during 6 months after the fire at a monthly rate. Runoff and sediment yield together with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in runoff water and organic carbon losses in eroded sediments (EOC) were evaluated throughout 2000. The last stage of abandonment. stands of cork trees, had the highest soil stability. Nevertheless, evidence of unfavourable soil conditions was detected at the shrub stage, when Cistus monspeliensis cover was the dominant opportunistic plant. This stage was considered to be a critical threshold leading either to degradation or regeneration processes according to fire frequency. A drastic change in soil properties, erosion and nutrient depletion occurred after the fire in all the environments. Statistics enabled to state that environments differed significantly in main soil properties. By statistically comparing the measured variables between the environments before and after the fire, DOC was found to be the soil parameter showing the highest significance between environments. Absolute values of erosion were low with respect to other Mediterranean environments although the shallow nature of these soils might deserve special attention because of a comparatively higher risk of degradation.

AB Sloping Vertisols having large exchangeable sodium contents are erodible. In Martinique, French West Indies, intensive market gardening during 15 years decreased their organic matter content, biological activity (roots, earthworms, mesofauna, microorganisms), soil porosity, and increased soil losses due to erosion. Conversely, old irrigated pastures (Digitaria decumbens, Pangola grass) on these soils maintained organic matter content, biological activity, soil porosity and aggregate stability. A research programme was set out in 1991 in the south-eastern part of Martinique in order to study the respective roles of grass roots and earthworms in the restoration of the properties of a degraded Vertisol. Plots with and without plants, with and without earthworms were tested and physical properties were followed during 4 years and compared with properties existing under market crops and old pastures. The restoration of physical properties was more rapid and more important in treatments with plants than in treatments without plants. Plants played a dominant role through rhizosphere effects and possible carbon rhizodeposition. The effect of earthworms was less important. Earthworms particularly increased the stability of aggregates of 200-500 mum size, and decreased clay dispersion. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Horqin Sandy Land is one of the serious desertification areas in the semiarid zone of north China. Shrubs are the dominant plant species in this region and they play an important role in the wind erosion-prone fragile ecosystem. This study deals with the differences of some chemical properties in the soils under shrub canopies and from adjacent open spaces and analyses their characteristics in the shrub rhizospheric soils and bulk soils. The results showed that: (1) the concentrations of organic C, total N, and total P, and the value of electrolytic conductivity (EC) in the soils under the canopy of shrubs increased by 56%, 51%, 37%, and 51%, respectively, compared with those of the soils in open spaces, but there was no significant difference in pH between the soils under shrub canopies and open spaces; (2) shrub rhizosphere soils exhibited significantly higher contents of organic C, total N, and values of EC as well as a lower value of pH compared to the bulk soils, but there was no significant difference in total P between rhizosphere and bulk soils; (3) there were close relationships between the properties in soils under shrub canopies and the rhizosphere soils, indicating that the development of "fertile islands" are favorable to root growth and induce greater amount of rhizodeposition, and vice versa; and (4) soils under Artemisia frigida and Caraganda microphylla canopies and rhizospheres had significantly higher organic C and total N contents than those of Artemisia halodendron and Salix gordejevii. The results suggested that shrubs were of vital importance for the sequestration and accumulation of nutrients and maintenance of soil fertility in the Horqin Sandy Land ecosystem.

AB We collected soil samples from 27 study sites across North Central United States to compare the soil carbon of short rotation poplar plantations to adjacent agricultural crops and woodlots. Soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged from 20 to more than 160 Mg/ha across the sampled sites. Lowest SOC levels were found in uplands and highest levels in riparian soils. We attributed differences in bulk density and SOC among cover types to the inclusion of woodlot soils in the analysis. Paired comparison found few differences between poplar and agricultural crops. Sites with significant comparisons varied in magnitude and direction. Relatively greater SOC was often observed in poplar when native soil carbon was low, but there were important exceptions. Woodlots consistently contained greater SOC than the other crops, especially at depth. We observed little difference between paired poplar and switchgrass, both promising bioenergy crops. There was no evidence of changes in poplar SOC relative to adjacent agricultural soils when considered for stand ages up to 12 years. Highly variable native SOC levels and subtle changes over time make verification of soil carbon sequestration among land cover types difficult. In addition to soil carbon storage potential, it is therefore important to consider opportunities offered by long-term sequestration of carbon in solid wood products and carbon-offset through production of bioenergy crops. Furthermore, short rotation poplars and switchgrass offer additional carbon sequestration and other environmental benefits such as soil erosion control, runoff abatement, and wildlife habitat improvement.

DE carbon sequestration; simulation modeling; EPIC
AB The Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator model (EPIC) was recently altered to include algorithms based upon concepts found in the Century model with the exception of a daily time step. We compared measured soil organic carbon (SOC) content values with simulated values to validate the new EPIC simulation model carbon sequestration routine. The simulations were based upon detailed soils data for three clay soils (Udic Haplusterts) and actual weather data recorded near the sample sites. Historical cropping systems for central Texas were simulated for a period of 120 years, the period from the original breaking of the native prairie sod to modern times. In addition, the effect of tilling the soil for 60 or more years and then returning the site to grass was simulated. Periods of restored grass were 6, 26, and 60 years. It was necessary to adjust a parameter, the fraction of humus in the passive pool, to make realistic simulations. Once adjusted, EPIC simulated the decline in SOC with agriculture well at all three sites in central Texas. EPIC also simulated the relative difference in SOC content occurring between continuously tilled sites and sites with restored grass well.

AB Savannas and grasslands in South Africa are adapted to fire, yet long-term effects of fire on soil, water and nutrients remain largely unknown. To determine whether frequent burning increases the tendency of soils to crust and alters soil chemistry, topsoils from 19 sites were examined in Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape where annual burning and fire exclusion experiments had been conducted for at least 28 years. A comparison of soils from burnt and unburnt plots revealed that composite samples taken to a depth of 10 cm from burnt plots had lower laboratory infiltration, electrical conductivity (EC) of 1:5 extracts, water-soluble K, water-soluble NH4, total C, total N and labile C. Burnt plots had higher pH in KCl, water dispersible clay and modulus of rupture. Rate of soil respiration from composite samples (0-2 cm) from burnt plots was lower than from unburnt plots (means of 21 vs. 36 ng C g(-1) s(-1)). Rainfall simulation on the same samples demonstrated that burnt plots crusted more rapidly than unburnt plots (19 vs. 35 mm h(-1)), while results from sampling at 1-cm intervals revealed that the greatest differences between burnt and unburnt plots were in the 0-1 cm layer. The top few centimetres of soil are likely to have a disproportionate effect on ecosystem functioning by influencing the rate of infiltration and mineralisation of soil organic matter. This thin surface layer has been named the pedoderm in this paper. Soil from 0-1 cm in burnt plots had lower total C (means of 0.8% vs. 2.7% for burnt and unburnt plots, respectively), total N (0.07% vs. 0.23%), (NH4)OAc-extractable Ca (7 vs. 17 mmol(c) kg(-1)), Mg (2 vs. 7 mmol(c) kg(-1)), K (0.8 vs. 1.5 mmol(c) kg(-1)) and a greater exchangeable Na percentage (17% vs. 8%). The results indicate that burning increases soil crusting. This was ascribed to a decrease in humus content (and associated disaggregating effect) and an increase in the dispersion of clay. Nutrients are lost from burnt plots over time, probably by the removal of ash in surface runoff. Calcium, Mg, and K were lost more readily than Na probably because plants take up these nutrients in greater concentration than Na. The net effect was an increase in the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). Crusting on burnt plots may be self-perpetuating, because increased runoff is likely to increase the loss of soluble salts.

AB The carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil-fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions.

AB Conservation tillage (CT) is practised on 45 million ha world-wide, predominantly in North and South America but its uptake is also increasing in South Africa, Australia and other semi-arid areas of the world. It is primarily used as a means to protect soils from erosion and compaction, to conserve moisture and reduce production costs. In Europe, the area cultivated using minimum tillage is increasing primarily in an effort to reduce production costs, but also as a way of preventing soil erosion and retain soil moisture. A large proportion (16%) of Europe's cultivated land is also prone to soil degradation but farmers and governments are being slow to recognise and address the problem, despite the widespread environmental problems that can occur when soils become degraded. Conservation tillage can improve soil structure and stability thereby facilitating better drainage and water holding capacity that reduces the extremes of water logging and drought. These improvements to soil structure also reduce the risk of runoff and pollution of surface waters with sediment, pesticides and nutrients. Reducing the intensity of soil cultivation lowers energy consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide, while carbon sequestration is raised though the increase in soil organic matter (SOM). Under conservation tillage, a richer soil biota develops that can improve nutrient recycling and this may also help combat crop pests and diseases. The greater availability of crop residues and weed seeds improves food supplies for insects, birds and small mammals. All these aspects are reviewed but detailed information on the environmental benefits of conservation tillage is sparse and disparate from European studies. No detailed studies have been conducted at the catchment scale in Europe, therefore some findings must be treated with caution until they can be verified at a larger scale and for a greater range of climatic, cropping and soil conditions.

AB Scrubland communities are the most common plant communities in eroded areas with Mediterranean climate. These protect the soil in different ways including the interception of raindrops (which lowers their erosive capacity) and the provision of organic carbon (necessary for the fort-nation of organomineral aggregates). Vegetation were analysed and rainfall simulations performed in 29 natural plots in areas of significant erosion in the Madrid (Spain) region. The results show that plant cover is the main factor reducing surface runoff and the movement of sediments. Vegetation structure is also important, with pluri-stratified communities offering more protection against water erosion than mono-stratified communities. The plant growth forms were also found to be influential. Nanophanerophytes as Rosmarintts officinalis were the most efficient of those studied. Biodiversity did not seem to be important in soil protection in the studied area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle, which has the potential to influence global climate. In this paper we presented an over-view of soil organic matter (SOM) models in the context of soil erosion and discussed basic processes driving erosion-induced SOC loss. Although the mechanism of this loss is poorly understood, erosion influences SOC in two ways: redistribution of C within the watershed or ecosystem, and loss of C to the atmosphere. Erosion disperses soil, altering its microbiological activity as well as water, air and nutrient regimes. This, along with sediment enrichment, has an impact on greenhouse gas emission from soil. For most of agricultural settings, field studies suggest that cultivation along with soil erosion are the primary reasons for SOC loss. Tracing the fate of eroded C is a challenging task. Modeling is the approach taken most often. In this paper we discuss approaches used in various SOC models to assess erosion-induced C loss from soil in agricultural ecosystems. An example with Century model applied to meadow and corn-soybean rotation under chisel-till demonstrated the model's ability to respond well to different erosion scenarios, It was estimated that at soil loss rate of 10 t ha(-1) year(-1) (value often considered a threshold for maintaining productivity) 19% of the total SOC loss would be attributed to erosion after 90 years of cultivation.

AB Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to study the loss of particles from agricultural fields, and the role of suspended particles in carrying pesticides in surface runoff and drainage water. Propiconazole, a widely used fungicide was applied to experimental fields located at Askim, SE-Norway. Samples from surface runoff and drainage water were collected and analyzed for sediment mass, pesticides, particulate and dissolved organic carbon through a whole year. The surface soil and the runoff material were characterized by its particle size distribution, organic carbon content in size fractions and its ability to bind propiconazole. The results show that ( 1) particle runoff mostly occurred during the rainfall event shortly after harrowing in autumn. The highest particle concentration observed in the surface runoff water was 4600 mg l(-1), and in the drainage water 1130 mg l(-1); (2) the erosion of surface soil is size selective. The runoff sediment contained finer particle/aggregates rich in organic matter compared to its original surface soil; (3) the distribution coefficient (K-d) of propiconazole was significantly higher in the runoff sediment than in the parent soil. According to our calculation, particle-bound propiconazole can represent up to 23% of the total amount of propiconazole in a water sample with a sediment concentration of 7600 mg l(-1), which will significantly influence the transport behavior of the pesticide.

AB The 3.5-3.2 Ga sedimentary record shows evidence of surface temperatures of 70 +/- 15 degreesC, nahcolite (NaHCO3) as a primary evaporitic mineral, and an aggressive weathering regime even in the absence of land vegetation. These features are best explained by a mixed CH4 and CO2 atmospheric greenhouse in which CH4/CO2 ratios were much less than1 and pCO(2) was at least 100-1000 times the present value and perhaps as high as several bars. The formation of large areas of continental crust at 3.2-3.0 Ga, including the Kaapvaal and Pilbara cratons, resulted in the gradual depletion of atmospheric CO2 through weathering. By 2.9-2.7 Ga, declining pCO(2) was associated with climatic cooling and siderite-free soils. Transitory CH4/CO2 ratios of similar to1 may have resulted in the sporadic formation of organic haze from atmospheric CH4, reflected in one or more isotopic excursions involving global deposition of abnormally C-13-depleted organic C. Surface temperatures of <60 degreesC after 2.9 Ga may have also increased the distribution and productivity of oxygenic photosynthetic microbes. Eventual lowering of new continental blocks by erosion, reduced loss of atmospheric CO2 due to weathering, and continued long-term tectonic recycling of CO2 resulted in rising pCO(2) and decreasing CH4/CO2 ratios in the later Archean and eventual reestablishment of a mainly CO2 greenhouse. Similar events may have been repeated in the latest Archean and earliest Proterozoic, but gradually rising production of O-2 effectively kept CH4/CO2 ratios to much less than1 at this time.

AB The origins of sediment budgeting in both river basin and coastal contexts are traced back to the 1950's. Interest in global environmental change has spurred interest in a variety of mass balance calculations that permit quantitative comparison from one region to another. In river basin budgets the storage term is simply the difference between an upstream input and a downstream output over a fixed time interval; in coastal sediment budgets attention is focused on the residual term after net changes in volume of sediment within a control cell have been determined. Questions of scale are handled differently in river basins and on coasts, primarily because of the necessity to define sediment budget cells in coastal work. Errors and uncertainties are increasingly systematically analyzed. Management implications are extensive including natural hazards, the effects of climate change and land use disturbance in addition to improved understanding of sediment transport patterns and magnitudes for rivers and coastal regions.

AB The mobilization of organic carbon (C) by water erosion could impact the terrestrial C budget, but the magnitude and direction of that impact remain uncertain due to a lack of data regarding the fates and quality of eroded C. A study was conducted to monitor total organic C and mineralizable C (MinC) in eroded materials from watersheds under no till (NT), chisel till (CT), disk till low input (DT-LI), pasture and forest. The DT-LI treatment relies on manure application and legume cover crops to partly supply the N needed when corn is grown, and on cultivation to reduce the use of herbicides. Each watershed was instrumented with a flume and a Coshocton wheel sampler for runoff measurement. Carbon dioxide (CO2) evolved during incubation (115 days) of runoff samples was fitted to a first-order decomposition model to derive MinC. Annual soil (6.2 Mg ha(-1)) and organic C (113.8 kg C ha(-1)) losses were twice as much in the DT-LI than in the other watersheds (<2.7 Mg soil ha(-1), <60 kg C ha(-1)). More than management practices, rainfall class (based on intensity and energy) was a better controller of sediment C concentration and biodegradability. Sediment collected during the low-intensity (fall/winter) storms contained more organic C (37 g C kg(-1)) and MinC (30-40% of sediment C) than materials displaced during the high-intensity summer storms (22.1 g C kg(-1) and 13%, respectively). These results suggest a more selective detachment and sorting of labile C fractions during low-intensity storms. However, despite the control of low-intensity storm on sediment C concentration and quality, increased soil loss with high-energy rainfall suggests that a few infrequent but high-energy storms could determine the overall impact of erosional events,on terrestrial C cycling.

AB The distributions of Cs-137 and organic carbon and their relationships in various particle size fractions of an Alumi-Haplic Acrisol in Southern China were studied. Cs-137 was enriched primarily in the clay fraction (<2 mum), indicating that Cs-137 was preferentially adsorbed by finer soil particles. Organic carbon content in the clay fraction was no higher than in the very fine silt fraction (2-5 mum) for most soil samples. For different particle size fractions of the Alumi-Haplic Acrisol, the relationship between Cs-137 and organic carbon could be described by a power function for the clay fraction (<2 mum) and by a linear function for the other fractions. The significant correlation (r = 0.85, P = 0.05) between Cs-137 and organic carbon in the clay fraction (<2 mum) demonstrated that organic carbon contributed to Cs-137 sorption in the clay of the soil samples. A particle size correction factor was determined based on the distribution of Cs-137 in different particle size fractions. The value of 1.3-1.5 for the particle size correction factor indicated that selective removal of soil particles during soil erosion had an important effect on the accuracy of the estimate of the soil erosion rate for the Alumi-Haplic Acrisol of Southern China Therefore, it is necessary to consider the particle size correction factor in the quantitative models of soil erosion in the Alumi-Haplic Acrisol of Southern China characterized by at high clay content.

AB The objectives of this study were to investigate (i) the effect of soil organic matter (OM) content on the mechanisms that form a seal, and (ii) the OM content and aggregate size interactions in seal properties, infiltration rate (iii), and soil loss. Two samples of sandy loam (Humic Dystrudept) designated low-OM soil (2.3% by weight OM) and high-OM soil (3.5% OM) were studied. Aggregate sizes <2, 2 to 4, and 4 to 6 mm of each soil were exposed to 80 turn of simulated rainfall with an intensity of 42 ram h(-1). The final IR increased with increasing aggregate size from 4.2 to 5.2 ram h(-1) in the low-OM soil, and from 5.8 to 10.8 mm h(-1) in the high-OM soil. There was a significant interaction between OM content and aggregate size in seal formation and final IR. The low aggregate stability and the high dispersivity of the low-OM soil allowed the development of a dense and thick crust for all the aggregate sizes. Conversely, the high aggregate stability and the low dispersivity of the high-OM soil limited the seal formation. Consequently, the IR values were high and differences in IR among the three aggregate sizes in this soil were relatively high. The soil losses increased with increasing aggregate size, ranging from 4.5 x 10(-3) to 6.6 x 10(-3) kg m(-2) mm(-1) in the low-OM soil, and from 1.2 to 3.8 x 10(-3) kg m(-2) mm(-1) in the high-OM soil. In this case, no significant interaction was found between soil OM content and aggregate size.

AB Crop-pasture rotations (CPR) are unusual around the world but have been the predominant cropping system in Uruguay since the 1960s. Uruguay has a temperate sub-humid climate, 80% of its landscape (16 Mha) is climax grasslands C-3 and C-4 species. Beef, wool, and dairy are the main commodities. Crops occupy a portion of the remaining 20% land area, primarily on Argiudolls and Vertisols, rotated with seeded grass and legume pastures. Continuous cropping (CC) with conventional tillage (CT) has proven unsustainable due to decreased soil productivity. Seeded pasture periods increased soil productivity. CPR adoption created less variable inter-annual economic results, but soil degradation remained a major concern during the crop cycle using CT. Farmers and technicians became interested in no-till (NT) to reduce erosion and production cost. Currently, approximately 52% of crop producing farms and 25% of dairy farms have adopted NT. This paper synthesizes research results (mainly from long-term experiments) contrasting CC versus CPR with CT (1960-1990) and NT (from 1990). Soil erosion was reduced more than six times with NT in CC, and almost three times in CPR compared with CC using CT; but combining the use of CPR and NT resulted in the same low erosion rate as under natural pasture. The transition from CT to NT is not always easy. The time between herbicide application to pasture and planting of the first crop of the rotation crop cycle with NT is a critical transition factor to optimize N and water availability, and soil tilth. Chiseling or paraplowing can alleviate plow-pans inherited by NT from previous CT; but higher soil strength at the soil surface under NT contributes to better forage utilization under grazing. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content in CC decreased with CT, and was maintained with NT only if grain was harvested. In CC systems with harvested forage, SOC decreased even with NT. CPR with NT maintained or increased the original SOC content. The paper concludes with a discussion on the relative sustainability of CC versus CPR with NT. Both are sustainable from the soil quality and productivity standpoints. But compared with CC, CPR is a more economically and climatically buffered system, due to higher diversity. Also, CPR systems are more environmentally sustainable since fuel and agrochemicals usage is reduced approximately 50%. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation tillage has become a major soil management strategy to reduce soil erosion and improve soil quality, yet the impacts of crop rotation on soil responses to conservation tillage remain poorly described. We investigated the effects, of (i) perennial grass cover versus annual cropping and (ii) type of break crop in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based crop rotation system on surface-soil (0-10 cm) structural and organic matter properties towards the end of a decade of continuous management on an Albic Luvisol in the cold, semiarid region of northwestern Canada. Soil aggregation was at state to resist water erosion more under perennial grass (i.e. bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.)) than under annual cropping systems (mean-weight diameter of 2.1 and 1.6 mm under perennial and annual systems, respectively). Soil organic C was higher (44 g C kg(-1) soil versus 38 g C kg(-1) soil), but total soil N was lower (3.5 g N kg(-1) soil versus 3.9 g N kg(-1) soil) under perennial compared with annual cropping systems. There were few significant differences in soil-structural properties among the various annual cropping systems. The largest effect was greater light-fraction C and N under continuous wheat(4.0 g C kg(-1) soil and 0.27 g N kg(-1) soil) compared with other rotations, especially wheat-wheat-tallow (2.4 g C kg-1 soil and 0.16 g N kg(-1) soil), as a result of higher residue inputs. Relationships between mean-weight diameter of water-stable aggregates and biochemical properties were strongest for soil microbial biomass C and soil organic C. Perennial grass cover exhibited greater potential to preserve soil-structural properties than no-tillage annual cropping. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil erosion and moisture stress are the major problems for crop production and sustainable land management in Ethiopia. This study was conducted to determine whether incorporation of crop residues modifies the physical properties of the surface soil by increasing water infiltration and storage, decreasing evaporation rate, and improving soil tilth. The effect of maize (Zea mays L.) residues incorporated at a rate of 6 Mg ha(-1) (with inorganic fertilizer (RF) and without (R)) were compared to applying inorganic fertilizer alone (F) and a control (C) on two soil types (a Mollic Andosol with sandy loam texture and a Dystric Nitosol with clayey texture) in the South Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia.
   After three (annual) residue incorporations, penetration resistance at the 10 cm depth of both soils and shear resistance at the 5 cm depth of the sandy loam soil were 22-52% lower in the RF and R treatments than in the C treatment. The macro-plus mesoporosity in the RF treatment of the sandy loam soil (0-7 cm depth) was 22% higher compared to that of the C treatment. Evaporative flux (0-20cm depth) in the RF and R treatments of the sandy loam soil and in the R treatment of the clayey soil were lower compared to the C treatment by 39-57%. The results indicate that incorporating crop residues, especially in conjunction with the use of inorganic fertilizers, can improve rain water use efficiency and soil tilth. This will also have a direct effect in minimizing the rate of soil erosion in the area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the degradation of soil quality and find ways to maintain soil fertility on the Loess Plateau of China, the effects of cultivation time on total organic carbon (TOC), light fraction of organic carbon (LFOC), and microbial biomass carbon (NIB-C) in two soil chronosequences comprised of Huangmian (Calcaric Cambisols, FAO) and Huihe (Haplic Greyxems, FAO) soils were investigated. The effects of fertilization on the TOC and its fractions were also studied using samples from a long-term experiment on Heilu soil (Calcic Kastanozems, FAO). Upon cultivation, Huangmian soil (0-20 cm) lost 77% of TOC within 5 years, at a reduction rate of 2.15 Mg C ha(-1) per year. The Huihe soil (0-20 cm) lost 70% of TOC at a rate of 0.96-1.06 Mg C ha(-1) per year over 42 years. In the Huangmian soil, water and tillage erosion are likely the main reasons for organic carbon decline, while organic matter decomposition and water erosion appear to be dominant factors in the Huihe soil. The LFOC decreased by 73 and 90% for the Huangmian and Huihe soil for the corresponding period. Changes in microbial biomass carbon (NIB-C) showed the same trend as TOC and LFOC. The results of the long-term experiment on the Heilu soil indicated that manure alone and manure plus nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer treatments restored TOC and MB-C to the level of the native sod, indicating the importance of manure addition in maintaining soil fertility over the long term (20 years). The straw return plus nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer treatment had a significantly higher TOC than nitrogen plus phosphorus fertilizer alone. Organic matter additions in the form of manure or straw, either alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers, appears to be more effective in maintaining or restoring organic matter in Heilu soil on the Loess Plateau than chemical fertilizer alone.

AB Several management systems can improve soil productivity. By studying aggregate stability it is possible to quantify whether or not the management is ameliorating the natural soil properties and the land capability for agriculture. The effect of three tillage systems on the stability of soil aggregates and soil organic carbon was studied in comparison to reference plots with grass and bare soil. Samples were collected at the Pesagro Experimental Research Station in Paty do Alferes, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from an experiment that has been carried out from 1995 to 2001, on a Dystrophic Red Latosol (Typic Haplorthox). Aggregate size distribution mean weight diameter, geometric mean diameter of the aggregates, and total organic carbon in each aggregate size fraction were determined. The proportion of aggregates with diameter greater than or equal to2 mm appeared to be a suitable indicator of the influence of tillage systems on aggregation. At a depth of 0-5 cm, aggregates greater than or equal to2 mm were 50% of soil under no-tillage, which was greater than under animal traction (35%) and conventional tillage (30%). Total organic carbon concentration was greater under no-tillage (19 g kg(-1)) than under conventional tillage (11 g kg(-1)) at a depth of 0-5 cm, but not significantly different (average 13 g kg(-1)) at a depth of 5-10 cm. Soil exposure with tillage and lack of residue inputs caused declines in aggregation and organic carbon, both of which make soil susceptible to erosion. Adoption of no-tillage led to a decline in aggregation compared with grass reference, but did significantly alter soil organic concentration, suggesting it was a valuable conservation practice for vegetable production on sloping soils.

AB The fraction of clay that disperses in water, water-dispersible clay (WDC), is recognized as an important property with respect to predicting soil erosion and colloid leaching. Using six mineralogically similar soils with 12, 18, 24, 28, 37, and 43% clay, we studied the of soil clay content, initial matric potential (IMP; psi = -2.5, -100, and -15 500 hPa), and wetting rate on WDC released in response to infiltration of low-ionic strength rainwater, using a energy input measurement of WDC (LE-WDC). These results were referenced by WDC obtained by a conventional, high-energy input measurement based on air-dried soil (HE-WDC). The energy input in the dispersion procedure significantly affected the release of WDC. The amount of HE-WDC increased with clay content, while the amount of LE-WDC decreased with increasing clay content. The decrease in LE-WDC was explained by an increase in cohesive strength, reflected by the increase in water-stable aggregates (greater than or equal to4 mm). A strong dependency of IMP on LE-WDC was observed, with maximum release of LE-WDC from soils that were at -2.5 hPa before measurement. Decreasing soil matric potential in the period before measurement reduced LE-WDC and also reduced the dependency of soil clay content, with soils incubated at -15 500 hPa releasing a low amount of LE-WDC independent of clay content. The content of particulate organic C (POC) in the LE-WDC decreased with inconsequence creasing clay content, and increased after drying to -15 500 hPa. Colloid dispersibility changed as a function of time and moisture status, with the main changes occurring during or immediately after of the moisture content. Increasing the wetting rate resulted in a doubling of the amount of LE-WDC released from the initially dry soil (-15 500 hPa), while no effect of wetting rate was observed at higher initial matric potentials.

AB The extensive soil erosion in Iceland during the past millennium has led to an irregular distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC). Intact and fully vegetated areas typically have Andosols with large amounts of organic carbon, whereas eroded areas are barren deserts with little organic carbon. We estimate the amount of organic carbon eroded during the past millennium is 120500 x 10(6) t, whereas the to al organic carbon in Icelandic soils is 2.1 x 10(9) t. Approximately half of the eroded organic carbon (60-250 x 10(6) t C) has been oxidized and released to the atmosphere. Current ongoing losses of SOC are estimated to be 50-100 x 10(3) t C yr(-1). We also consider procedures for sequestering carbon to restore the carbon dynamics of denuded areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Small mountainous rivers (SMR) export globally significant quantities of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the oceans, the composition of which may be distinct from POC delivered by major world rivers. To better constrain the controls on the Delta(14)C signatures of POC suspended in SMR, we examined the temporal variability of Delta(14)C and delta(13)C of POC suspended in the Santa Clara River, a SMR in California, USA. Our data suggest mixing of bedrock and contemporary soil, which can be applied to other SMR in contrasting climate zones and with varying land cover. The data also suggest that chemical denudation is incomplete, but effective to the point that only the most recalcitrant moieties of the parent POC are exported. We further propose sediment yield as a potentially useful proxy for the Delta(14)C of riverine POC. A preliminary analysis of the existing data for a spectrum of rivers supports this hypothesis.

AB Climate warming is most pronounced at high latitudes, which could result in the intensification of the extensively cultivated areas in the boreal zone and could further enhance rates of forest clearing in the coming decades. Using paired forest-field sampling and a chronosequence approach, we investigated the effect of conversion of boreal forest to agriculture on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in interior Alaska. Chronosequences showed large soil C losses during the first two decades following deforestation, with mean C stocks in agricultural soils being 44% or 8.3 kg m(-2) lower than C stocks in original forest soils. This suggests that soil C losses from land-use change in the boreal region may be greater than those in other biomes. Analyses of changes in stable C isotopes and in quality of soil organic matter showed that organic C was lost from soils by combustion of cleared forest material, decomposition of organic matter and possibly erosion. Chronosequences indicated an increase in C storage during later decades after forest clearing, with 60-year-old grassland showing net ecosystem C gain of 2.1 kg m(-2) over the original forest. This increase in C stock resulted probably from a combination of large C inputs from belowground biomass and low C losses due to a small original forest soil C stock and low tillage frequency. Reductions in soil N stocks caused by land-use change were smaller than reductions in C stocks (34% or 0.31 kg m(-2)), resulting in lower C/N ratios in field compared with forest mineral soils, despite the occasional incorporation of high-C forest-floor material into field soils. Carbon mineralization per unit of mineralized N was considerably higher in forests than in fields, which could indicate that decomposition rates are more sensitive in forest soils than in field soils to inorganic N addition (e.g. by increased N deposition from the atmosphere). If forest conversion to agriculture becomes more widespread in the boreal region, the resulting C losses (51% or 11.2 kg m(-2) at the ecosystem level in this study) will induce a positive feedback to climatic warming and additional land-use change. However, by selecting relatively C-poor soils and by implementing management practices that preserve C, losses of C from soils can be reduced.

   livestock production; sustainable soil management
AB The Nigerian savanna zone is currently witnessing increasing intensities of crop and livestock production activities that are resulting in increased soil erosion, de-vegetation of the land area, and desert encroachment especially during the dry season. These may have led to the presence of several over-grazed and bare ground areas that is highly susceptible to soil erosion. At harvest, both crop and residues are removed from the field, thus limiting potential nutrient recycling between crop and soil, and further impoverishing the nutrient status of the soils. The Nigerian savanna zone soils therefore have low total nitrogen, organic carbon, available phosphorus and cation exchange capacity. They also have very poor moisture holding capacity, and are therefore said to have poor fertility status and very low buffering capacity. The present study aimed to determine effects of grain legumes on soil potential in the arid systems was therefore imposed on the soils in the Zaria area. Results show that sole legumes and legume/maize treatments generally resulted in higher organic carbon contribution than sole maize treatment, suggesting that sole maize grown continuously on one farm for years could degrade the organic carbon content of the soil. Also, the sole legume and legume/maize treatments resulted in improvements in soil nitrogen in the range between 65.6 and 84.8 %, while nitrogen under sole maize resulted in only 5.9 % increase. In 2001, groundnut/maize intercrop resulted in significantly higher maize grain yield (1.49 t ha(-1)) than the other treatments. Comparing between maize grain yields in 2001 and 2002, maize grain improved by 20.1% under sole maize, 95.0% under maize in sole groundnut, 92.8% under maize in soybean, and 98.4% under maize in cowpea. This would confirm that the sole legume planting for two years restored fertility status of the soils and enhanced the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, to have resulted in greater maize grain yield than under the sole maize despite the 120 kg N fertilizer applied to the sole maize.

AB Sustainable agriculture is essential for man's survival, especially given our rapidly increasing population. Expansion of agriculture into remaining areas of natural vegetation is undesirable, as this would reduce biodiversity on the planet. Maintaining or indeed improving crop yields on existing farmed land, whether on a smallholder scale or on larger farms, is thus necessary. One of the limiting factors is often weed control; biological control of weeds is generally of limited use and mechanical control is either often difficult with machinery or very laborious by hand. Thus the use of herbicides has become very important. Minimum cultivation can also be important, as it reduces the power required to work the soil, limits erosion and helps to maintain the organic matter content of the soil. This last aspect helps preserve both the structure of soil and its populations of organisms, and also sustains the Earth's soil as a massive sink for carbon, an important consideration in the light of global warming. The introduction of the bipyridinium herbicide paraquat in the early 1960s greatly facilitated weed control in many crops. Paraquat has the unusual property of being active only by direct spray onto plants and not by uptake from soil in which strong binding deactivates it. Together with its rapid action in light in killing green plant tissue, such properties allow paraquat to be used in many crops, including those grown by low-tillage methods. This paper reviews the ways in which agricultural systems have been and are being developed to make use of these properties, and provides a risk/benefit analysis of the world-wide use of paraquat over nearly 40 years.

AB The delta(13)C signature of sedimentary organic matter acts as a tracer for past changes in the terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycles. Compound-specific delta(13)C analysis enables these two signals to be disentangled. We compare the rnolecular-isotopic records from a transect of five lakes between 1820 and 4595 in a.s.l. on Mt. Kenya, East Africa, spanning the last similar to 100,000 years, with multiproxy palaeoenvironmental data, in order to determine the mechanisms underlying Late Quaternary variations in carbon cycling at different altitudes. The amplitude of down-core variations in the delta(13)C values of total organic carbon varied from 4.8%. to 17.4%o. The delta(13)C signals in compounds of terrestrial, aquatic-macrophyte and algal origin were tightly coupled, reflecting strong atmospheric control. During the early glacial and the last glacial maximum, the effects of sub-ambient CO, and enhanced moisture stress reinforced each other, resulting in carbon starvation and very high delta(13)C values. In contrast, smaller, millennial-scale shifts in delta(13)C during the late-glacial and Holocene were driven primarily by fluctuations in monsoon precipitation. However, the impact of Late Quaternary atmospheric changes were complex, involving variations in biomass burning, vegetation cover, soil erosion, lake levels and water chemistry in addition to direct physiological responses by higher plants and algae.

AB We report on epibenthic foraminiferal delta(18)O and delta(13)C and percentage coarse fraction records from Caribbean Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 999 (12degrees44'N, 78degrees44'W, water depth 2828 m) spanning the interval from 8.5 to 5.3 Ma. Low epibenthic delta(13)C values and low amounts of sand-sized particles (mostly foraminifer shells) indicate a poorly ventilated deep Caribbean throughout the late Miocene. At this time the deep Caribbean was dominated by a nutrient-rich and corrosive water mass. A generally constant delta(13)C gradient between the Caribbean and deep Atlantic records during the late Miocene suggests that the fluctuations in delta(13)C reflect global changes in delta(13)C of the dissolved inorganic carbon due to varying erosion of organic carbon from terrigenous soils and shelf sediments. The observed 100-kyr cyclicity of epibenthic delta(13)C is in good accordance with the variability of terrigenous input to the equatorial Atlantic as recorded by magnetic susceptibility records of the Ceara Rise. However, some short-term gradient changes between 7.0 and 4.5 Ma indicate a poorer ventilation of the deep Atlantic related to a reduced production of deep water in the Atlantic. The Messinian Salinity Crisis between 6.0 and 5.3 Ma did not affect the intermediate to deep water gradient between the Caribbean and the Atlantic. Comparison to the Bahama platform record of ODP Site 1006, however, indicates a poorer ventilation of the shallower northern Caribbean basins coincident with the isolation of the Mediterranean Sea.

AB Management of crop residues is an important consideration for reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic carbon. Current methods of measuring residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover over large fields. The objectives of this research were to determine the spectral reflectance of crop residues and soils and to assess the limits of discrimination that can be expected in mixed scenes. Spectral reflectances of dry and wet crop residues plus three diverse soils were measured over the 400-2400 nm wavelength region. Reflectance values for scenes with varying proportions of crop residues and soils were simulated. Additional spectra of scenes with mixtures of crop residues, green vegetation, and soil were also acquired in corn, soybean, and wheat fields with different tillage treatments. The spectra of dry crop residues displayed a broad absorption feature near 2100 nm, associated with cellulose-lignin, that was absent in spectra of soils. Crop residue cover was linearly related (r(2) = 0.89) to the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), which was defined as the relative depth of this absorption feature. Green vegetation cover in the scene attenuated CAI, but was linearly related to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, r(2) = 0.93). A novel method is proposed to assess soil tillage intensity classes using CAI and NDVI. Regional surveys of soil conservation practices that affect soil carbon dynamics may be feasible using advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB A small sedimentary basin (the Yuehu lagoon), located at the eastern tip of Shandong Peninsula, China, was selected to study its filling by sediment and the vertical flux of particulate organic carbon in response to natural/anthropogenic processes. Surficial and short core sediment samples were collected and analyzed to obtain data sets of grain size, organic carbon content, deposition rates and vertical fluxes of sediment and organic carbon. The analytical results show that the lagoon is covered mainly with fine-grained sediments with high deposition rate and particulate organic carbon content being found from the central part of the mud deposit. The sediment balance of the lagoon indicates high denudation rates of the catchment basin, which may be related to soil erosion in response to farming and land use pattern changes. Furthermore, preliminary analysis of the organic carbon fluxes of the Yuehu lagoon and other embayments of the region shows that these coastal systems make an important contribution to the regional shallow sea carbon burial.

AB This study aimed to evaluate physical and chemical alterations in a distrophyc Yellow Argisol (Ultisol) presenting loamy to clayey texture and a smooth relief under different use at the "Favo de Mel" settlement, Sena Madureira county, Acre State, Brazil. At the beginning of the rainy season (October 1999), soil material was collected in the following land use: native forest (control), recently deforested (slash and burn); a two-year old crop of palm tree (Bactris gassipae); and a four-year old Brachiaria (Brachiaria brizantha) pasture. A trench was opened in each area, where 12 samples were collected in thin layers from the soil surface to 0.60 m deep. Pedogenetic horizon samples were subjected collected for physical and chemical charactheristics(granulometry, water-dispersed clay, soil bulk density, soil resistance to penetration, sediment parameters; chemical, exchangeable cations, available phosphorus, pH in water and in KCl, exchangeable aluminum, organic carbon, sulfuric acid digestion, equilibrium phosphorus, humic substances). It was found that the soil under Brachiaria pasture presented the highest soil bulk density values in the A horizon, which suggests a tendency to compaction. The evaluated nutrients and organic carbon contents were low and concentrated in the top surface layer. Potassium showed a drastic decrease in the soil under Brachiaria pasture, probably due to losses by erosion, burning, and grazing. Among organic compounds, the humin fraction prevailed in all evaluated systems.

AB The efficacy of no-tillage systems in reducing water erosion depends largely on the soil cover by crop residues. The study was carried out in Santa Catarina State, Southern Brazil, from August 2001 to July 2002, aiming to evaluate the decay of corn residue on the surface of an Inseptisol and its influence on soil properties. The treatments, with three replicates, were: bare soil (BS), 8.77 Mg ha(-1) of air dried corn residue (CR) and 8.77 Mg ha(-1) of air dried corn residue plus 100 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen (CR + N). The remaining residue biomass on soil and its organic carbon and total nitrogen contents were evaluated every 30 days. It was also determined organic carbon, total nitrogen, potassium, pH, soil temperature, and moisture in the superficial 0-0.03 m soil layer. The atmospheric temperature was recorded one meter above the soil surface. The CR + N treatment presented a faster decomposition rate than CR, especially in the first 120 days. The estimated time needed for an almost total decomposition of the corn residue was, approximately, 1300 days for CR and 900 for CR + N.

TI Carbon pools and accumulation rates in an age-series of soils in drained

SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English

ID TUNDRA SOILS; ENVIRONMENT; STORAGE; BARROW; CANADA
AB We examined soils in 20 drained thaw-lake basins (DTLBs) near Barrow representing four age classes: young [0-50 years before present (BP)], medium (50-300 BP), old (300-2000 BP), and ancient (2000-5500 BP). In addition, we examined an erosional remnant that is about 8000 yr in age with deep organic deposits. There are significant age-related differences in thickness of the organic layer, which for DTLBs represents surface organic accumulation since lake drainage. The lower portion of the organic layer progresses in decomposition stage from fibric in young basins to sapric in ancient basins and the erosional remnant. Whereas extractable organic matter (humic- and fulvic-acid fractions) in the organic layer decreases, the nonextractable portion (humin) increases with basin age. There are significant age-related differences (p = 0.027) in soil organic carbon (SOC) of the organic layer; however, there were no significant differences in C pools for other depths or within the upper 100 cm. Profile SOC pools in DTLBs average 48 kg m(-3), which is less than elsewhere on the Arctic Coastal Plain (62 kg m(-3)). From a depth of 100 to approximately 160 cm, SOC pools average 3.2 kg C m(-2)dm(-1), confirming that there are large amounts of SOC below the traditional reporting depth of 100 cm. The spatial variability of SOC pools increases with relative basin age class and is likely because of increased variability in hydrology related to enrichment of ground ice in the upper permafrost. The long-term net accumulation (during the last 5500 yr) of SOC is 13 g m(-2) yr(-1).

AB Landscapes reflect a legacy of tectonic and climatic forcing as modulated by surface processes. Because the morphologic characteristics of landscapes often do not allow us to uniquely define the relative roles of tectonic deformation and climate, additional constraints are required to interpret and predict landscape dynamics. Here we describe a coupled model for the transport of soil and tracer particles at the hillslope scale. To illustrate the utility of this methodology, we modeled the evolution of two synthetic hillslopes with identical initial and boundary conditions but different histories of climate-induced changes in the efficiency of soil transport. While one hillslope experienced an initial phase of rapid transport followed by a period of retarded transport, the other hillslope experienced the opposite sequence. Both model hillslopes contain a subsurface layer of tracer particles that becomes exhumed and incorporated into the soil due to transport and mixing processes. Whereas the morphology of the two model hillslopes cannot be easily distinguished at the simulation conclusion, the spatial distribution of tracer particles along the slope is distinctive for the two cases. We applied the coupled model to our study site along the Charwell River, South Island, New Zealand, where tephra deposits within loess-dominated soils have been exhumed and incorporated into an upper layer of bioturbated and mobile soil. We reconstructed the late Pleistocene hillslope geometry using soil stratigraphic data gathered along the study transect. Because bioturbation appears to be the predominant transport mechanism, the efficiency of soil transport likely varies with time, reflecting the influence of climate-related changes in the dominant floral or faunal community. The modeled evolution of hillslope form and tephra concentration along the study transect is consistent with observations obtained from topographic surveys and laboratory analysis of tephra concentrations in continuous-core soil samples. Low transport rates are apparently associated with grass/shrub-dominated slopes during the late Pleistocene, whereas forest colonization during the Holocene increased flux rates, transforming flat, locally incised slopes into broadly convex ones. Our results attest to the utility of coupled models for tasks such as deciphering landscape history and predicting the downslope flux of soil organic carbon.

AB Depth profiles of various organic micropollutants were measured in floodplain soils of the river Elbe, Germany. The study area lies in the former East Germany (GDR) and displays elevated concentrations of pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Depth distributions were found to vary at different sampling points and among the individual compounds, which could only partly be explained by comparing normalized concentrations (organic carbon). Metabolization, mobilization, and effects of sedimentation and erosion also need to be taken into account to understand the contaminant patterns found in the different profiles.

AB In a region where water is the primary limiting factor of crop production, loss of water from fields by overland flow represents an economic loss to producers. Traditional crop management practices in north-central Oregon have led to crop water loss by overland flow. In 1931, a long-term experiment was begun near Pendleton, Oregon, in a Walla Walla silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Haploxeroll-US; Kastanozems-FAO), to examine the influence on soil fertility and crop production by nutrient amendments and crop residue management practices. This experiment provided the opportunity to evaluate the influence of a several traditional farming practices on field hydrology. Tillage in all treatments consisted of moldboard plowing and multiple passes with secondary tillage equipment to smooth the surface for planting and for weed control. The treatments were combinations of nutrient amendments (0.90 kg N ha(-1) commercial fertilizer, and 145 kg N ha(-1) from manure) and residue management (fall-burn, spring-burn, and no-burn), whose soil organic carbon increased with increasing nutrient amendments. These treatments were in a winter wheat-fallow system and represent a set of past and current cultural practices. Overland flow from these treatments was measured. Lister furrows separated the plots of 12 m x 40 m (approximate to0.05 ha) to prevent overland flow from treatment to treatment and were instrumented with weirs to capture and measure overland flow. To determine if hydrologic differences existed between treatments, we tested the overland flow to precipitation (Q/P) ratio. The Q/P ratio (P < 0.15) was greatest within crop year/low soil fertility (0 kg N ha(-1), burn) whereas the high fertility (145 kg N ha(-1), no-burn) treatment crop year plots Q/P ratios were similar to fallow, standing stubble plots. Most notably, the manure amendment plots in crop, produce significantly less overland flow than the other residue and nutrient management practices, and marginally less overland flow than treatments in stubble. This research demonstrates that overland flow was greater from low fertility and stubble burned treatments. Increased overland flow increases the risk of soil erosion and loss of water to overland flow is potentially a loss of needed soil water for crop growth and production. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and stable and radiocarbon isotope distributions are compared for dated cores from the 1970s and 2000 for a 25-year retrospective in Lake Washington, Seattle, WA (USA). Contamination of Lake Washington sediments by petrogenic aliphatic hydrocarbons and pyrolytic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via atmospheric deposition and stormwater runoff peaked between the 1950s and 1970s and has since decreased as stormwater inputs have been reduced. Radiocarbon signatures (Delta(14)C, parts per thousand) of total organic carbon decrease (increased "age") in the depth interval of highest hydrocarbon concentration. Graphitic black carbon in the year 2000 core showed a historical profile similar to that of the PAH; however high background sediments deposited before the founding of Seattle indicates a considerable nonindustrial component derived from weathering in the watershed. Unlike hydrocarbon contamination, input of terrestrial organic matter (tracked by long-chain fatty alcohols) has increased throughout the late 20th century, documenting a shift in pollutant sources away from hydrocarbons and toward anthropogenic erosion of the region's soils.

AB Society is facing three related issues: overreliance on imported fuel, increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and producing sufficient food for a growing world population. The U.S. Department of Energy and private enterprise are developing technology necessary to use high-cellulose feedstock, such as crop residues, for ethanol production. Corn (Zea mays L.) residue can provide about 1.7 times more C than barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (A vena sativa L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residues based on production levels. Removal of crop residue from the field must be balanced against impacting the environment (soil erosion), maintaining soil organic matter levels, and preserving or enhancing productivity. Our objective is to summarize published works for potential impacts of wide-scale, corn stover collection on corn production capacity in Corn Belt soils. We address the issue of crop yield (sustainability) and related soil processes directly. However, scarcity of data requires us to deal with the issue of greenhouse gases indirectly and by inference. All ramifications of new management practices and crop uses must be explored and evaluated fully before an industry is established. Our conclusion is that within limits, corn stover can be harvested for ethanol production to provide a renewable, domestic source of energy that reduces greenhouse gases. Recommendation for removal rates will vary based on regional yield, climatic conditions, and cultural practices. Agronomists are challenged to develop a procedure (tool) for recommending maximum permissible removal rates that ensure sustained soil productivity.

AB In the Great Plains of North America potential evaporation exceeds precipitation during most months of the year. About 75% of the annual precipitation is received from April through September, and is accompanied by high temperatures and low relative humidity. Dryland agriculture in the Great Plains has depended on wheat production in a wheat-fallow agroecosystern (one crop year followed by a fallow year). Historically this system has used mechanical weed control practices during the fallow period, which leaves essentially no crop residue cover for protection against soil erosion and greatly accelerates soil organic carbon oxidation. This paper reviews the progress made in precipitation management in the North American Great Plains and synthesises data from an existing long-term experiment to demonstrate the management principles involved.
   The long-term experiment was established in 1985 to identify dryland crop and soil management systems that would maximize precipitation use efficiency (maximization of biomass production per unit of precipitation received), improve soil productivity, and increase economic return to the farmers in the West Central portion of the Great Plains. Embedded within the primary objective are subobjectives that focus on reducing the amount of summer fallow time and reversing the soil degradation that has occurred in the wheat-fallow cropping system.
   The experiment consists of four variables: 1) Climate regime; 2) Soils; 3) Management systems; and 4) Time. The climate variable is based on three levels of potential evapotranspiration (ET), which are represented by three sites in eastern Colorado. All sites have annual long-term precipitation averages of approximately 400-450 mm, but vary in growing season open pan evaporation from 1600 mm in the north to 1975 mm in the south. The soil variable is represented by a catenary sequence of soils at each site. Management systems, the third variable, differ in the amount of summer fallow time and emphasize increased crop diversity. All systems are managed with no-till techniques. The fourth variable is time, and the results presented in this paper are for the first 12 yr (3 cycles of the 4-yr system). Comparing yields of cropping systems that differ in cycle length and systems that contain fallow periods, when no crop is produced, is done with a technique called "annualisation". Yields are "annualised" by summing yields for all crops in the system and dividing by the total number of years in the system cycle. For example in a wheat-fallow system the wheat yield is divided by two because it takes 2 yr to produce one crop.
   Cropping system intensification increased annualised grain and crop residue yields by 75 to 100% compared to wheat-fallow. Net return to farmers increased by 25% to 45% compared to wheat-fallow. Intensified cropping systems increased soil organic C content by 875 and 1400 kg ha(-1), respectively, after 12 yr compared to the wheat-fallow system. All cropping system effects were independent of climate and soil gradients, meaning that the potential for C sequestration exists in all combinations of climates and soils. Soil C gains were directly correlated to the amount of crop residue C returned to the soil. Improved macroaggregation was also associated with increases in the C content of the aggregates. Soil bulk density was reduced by 0.01g cm(-1) for each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition over the 12-yr period, and each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition increased effective porosity by 0.3%. No-till practices have made it possible to increase cropping intensification beyond the traditional wheat-fallow system and in turn water-use efficiency has increased by 30% in West Central Great Plains agroecosystems. Cropping intensification has also provided positive feedbacks to soil productivity via the increased amounts of crop residue being returned to the soil.

AB Concentrations of Cs-137 in sediment and seawater samples in the East Sea (Japan Sea) adjacent to Yangnam, Korea were measured and data on the physical and chemical properties of the sediments were collected. The concentrations of Cs-137 in the sediment samples were in the range of less than the minimum detectable activity (MDA)-7.19 Bq/kg-dry, and the values were linearly correlated with particle size, total organic carbon (TOC), H, N or S content of the sediment. The Cs-137 concentrations in the sediment samples were well fitted to a multiple regression equation with TOC contents and particle size distributions. The distribution coefficients, which indicate the degree of adsorption, of Cs-137 to the sediments, were strongly dependent on particle size and TOC content. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Holocene trophic state changes in relation to sea level variation in

AB Paleolimnological data are presented relating trophic development to sea level variation in Lake Blanca, a small (0.6 km(2)), coastal fresh waterbody in southern Uruguay. Using a sediment core that extended to 7300 years BP, analyses of grain size, thin sections, organic matter, carbonate, total carbon, nutrients, diatoms and palynomorphs, allowed us to infer changes in trophic state and paleosalinities, which were closely related to Holocene sea level variation. Higher trophic states were observed during regressive events, most probably due to increases in runoff and erosion as regression progressed. Four diatom association zones (DAZ) were identified in the sediment core. The basal core section pre-dated the first Holocene marine transgression, contained no diatoms, chrysophyte cysts or non-siliceous microalgae, and showed C/N ratios values higher than 20. Thus, it is likely that the system exhibited terrestrial characteristics. In the second section (similar to6500 - 2200 years BP, following the first Holocene transgression), there was dominance of marine/ brackish diatom species. The lowest trophic states of the core were observed in this section. The third section ( 2200 - 1100 years BP), represented the system as it became separate from the Atlantic Ocean, and showed a dominance of brackish/ freshwater species and increases in trophic state were observed. In the last section ( after 1100 years BP), the system became fully freshwater as no marine or brackish diatom species were found, but a trend to oligotrophication was observed, probably due to nutrient depletion. However, after similar to 1967 AD, eutrophication intensified because of forestry and soil fertilization in the catchment. Pollen association zones (PAZ) allowed us to identify four sections. Below 250 cm ( 2200 years BP), the core contained no pollen grains as redox potential and pH values were not conducive for pollen preservation. After 2200 years BP ( when the system started to separate from the ocean), xerophilic taxa typical of coastal dunes colonized the catchment. Only after similar to 1100 years BP ( after fully freshwater conditions established) pollen grains of trees were observed.

AB We examine surface sediment and water column total nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations for 12 estuaries with average water depths <4m, and calculated sediment loads ranging from 0.2 to 10.8 kg m(-2) year(-1). Sediment total nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon concentrations vary inversely with sediment loads due to: (i) the influx of more mineral-rich sediment into the estuaries; and (ii) increasing sediment sulfidation. Sediment total organic carbon (TOC) : total sulfur (TS) and TS : Fe(II) ratios correlated to sediment loads because enhanced sedimentation increases burial, hence the importance of sulfate reduction in organic matter degradation. Curvilinear relationships were found between a weathering index and organic matter &delta;C-13 in sediment, and sediment load. The rising phase of the curve (increasing weathering, lighter isotopic values) at low to intermediate loads relates to soil erosion, whereas regolith or bedrock erosion probably explains the declining phase of the curve (decreasing weathering, heavier isotopic values) at higher sediment loads. The pattern of change for water column total nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) with sediment loads is similar to that of the weathering index. Most water quality problems occur in association with soil erosion, and at sediment loads that are intermediate for the estuaries studied. Limited evidence is presented that flushing can moderate the impact of sediment loads upon the estuaries.

AB Evaluation of near-surface soil properties via remote sensing (RS) could facilitate soil survey mapping, erosion prediction, fertilization regimes, and allocation of agrochemicals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between soil spectral signature and near surface soil properties in conventionally managed row crop systems. High-resolution RS data were acquired over bare fields in the Coastal Plain, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge and Valley provinces of Alabama using the Airborne Terrestrial Applications Sensor (ATLAS) multispectral scanner. Soils ranged from sandy Kandiudults to fine textured Rhodudults. Surface soil samples (0-1 cm) were collected from 163 sampling points for soil water content, soil organic carbon (SOC), particle size distribution (PSD), and citrate dithionite extractable iron (Fe-d) content. Results showed that covariance among soil properties combined with mixed signatures limited our ability to identify discrete spectral response patterns for near-surface soil attributes. Dry, sandy epipedons at the Coastal Plain site provided ideal conditions and allowed for better discrimination among soil properties. Using ATLAS thermal infrared (TIR) bands, this study provides evidence that thermal spectra are more sensitive to small changes in near-surface mineral, organic and water content.

AB Soil erosion is a widespread geological process with strong capabilities to entrap, transport and redistribute surface soil. It is important to grade erosion intensity and estimate eroded soil mass. On the other hand, soil organic carbon pool (SOC), as the largest terrestrial carbon content, is prone to be affected by soil erosion. Soil erosion redistributes surface soil over landscape, and changes the physical environmental conditions. The consequences are depletion of SOC in eroded regions, emission of carbon dioxide during transportation and input of extra SOC in deposited sites. This paper quantified the effects of soil erosion on soil organic carbon through following three steps: firstly, soil erosion type and soil erosion intensity were determined by interpreting Landsat TM images. Secondly, through field investigation, soil type and soil profile data were collected, and SOC contents in the 0-20cm layer were constructed. Finally, supported by map algebra in Geographic Information System (GIS), soil organic carbon loss induced by soil erosion was calculated based on the national soil erosion modulus standard. Total annual SOC loss in China was about 1.595 x 10(8) ton-C yr(-1). Assuming 20% of SOC was oxidized, erosion induced CO2 emission was about 3.19 x 10(7) ton-C yr(-1).

AB Corn (Zea mays L.) stover is a potential biofuel; however, removing this stover from the land may increase the risk of erosion and reduce soil organic matter (SOM). Land application of corn stover fermentation by-product, which is about 70% lignin, may reduce the environmental risk from biofuel harvest by helping to stabilize soil structure. A column study, with soil collected from a toeslope (noneroded, Svea; fine loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Hapludoll) and a shoulder slope (severely eroded, Langhei; fine loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Eutrudepts) was conducted to evaluate the effect of fermentation by-product on soil properties. Soil was either not amended (control) or amended with corn stover or by-product at 0.75, 3.0, and 6.1 g kg(-1). Soils were incubated for 123 d at ambient temperature in a laboratory, with an initial water-filled pore space (WFPS) of 0.6 m(3) m(-3) and drying cycles to 0.35 m(3) m(-3) WFPS. Compared with the control, amending soil with 6.1 g by-product kg(-1) increased CO2 flux by 68% and increased soluble C and microbial biomass C by about 20%. In the severely eroded soil, humic acid concentration (r(2) = 0.97,p = 0.009) and aggregate stability (r(2) = 0.98, p = 0.005) increased linearly with increased by-product concentration. Water-holding capacity, bulk density, and aggregate distribution were not changed by soil amendments. Careful management of stover removal (avoiding eroded or erosion prone areas) and selective placement and rates of the by-product will contribute to a sustainable use of corn stover for ethanol production.

AB Soils under subsistence farming in semi-arid northeastern Brazil are showing progressive declines in soil fertility. In this study, we assessed the effects of subsistence farming on losses of organic nutrient pools in 10 independent sites that were distributed in five districts of two states. Each site had adjacent areas under dry forest and subsistence farming. Areas under each land use were separated in two groups that had different degrees of land degradation. Group assignment was based on land use history and visual observations of vegetation-soil degradation and was further evaluated using Cs-137 activity to estimate erosion. Four combinations of land use degradation were defined: undisturbed (UDF) and disturbed (DDF) dry forest, and preserved (PC) and degraded (DC) cultivated land. Soils were sampled in the 0- to 7.5- and 7.5- to 15-cm layers. The Cs-137 concentrations declined in the order UDF > DDF approximate to PC > DC. Soil C and N concentrations in DC (8.9 and 0.94 g kg(-1) soil, respectively) were half of those in UDF (17.8 and 1.51 g kg(-1) soil, respectively). The organic P (P-o)/inorganic P (P-i) ratio was 1.47 in UDF and decreased to 0.82 in PC and DC. Carbon losses in DC were attributed to erosion (43%) and to mineralization (57%) processes. Differences between UDF and other land uses were greater in the 0 to 7.5 cm than in the 0- to 15-cm layer. Carbon and N losses in low-P status soils, in addition to limited water availability and unsuitable land management techniques, are likely to restrict the recovery of degraded soils by traditional bush fallow techniques.

AB Agricultural lands may be used to produce short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs) for fuel or fiber, but the effects of SRWCs on soils are poorly understood. In this study, a SRWC was integrated with an annual row crop system in a row crop-SRWC-row crop rotation. The objective was to document the effects of the woody crop on soil total C, N, inorganic N, and aggregate stability after the site was returned to row crop production. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was followed by 4- and 5-yr rotations of American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.), followed by no-till corn (Zea mays L.) (SY4C and SY5C, respectively). Continuous row crops (soybean converted to corn) served as a control (SBC). Four rates of broadcast NH4NO3 were applied to corn. The study was in southwestern Tennessee on a Memphis-Loring silt loam intergrade (fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Hapludalfs-rine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs). During 3 yr of post-sycamore corn production, increases in soil total C concentration below a 2.5-cm depth were attributed to the sycamore crop. After fertilization of first-year corn at 73 and 146 kg N ha(-1), soil inorganic N concentrations were lower in the SY4C than the SBC system from 0 to 2.5 cm. Mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable soil aggregates at depths of 2.5 to 15 cm was greater for the SY4C than the SBC system. Four- and 5-yr sycamore rotations significantly affected chemical and physical properties of an agricultural soil.

AB Cultivation and overgrazing are widely recognized as the primary causes of desertification of sandy grassland in the semi-arid region of northern China. Very little is known about the effect of cultivation and overgrazing on soil physical, chemical and biological properties in this region. The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of changes in soil properties due to 3 years of cultivation (3CGS) and 5 years of ungrazed exclosure (5RGS) in a degraded grassland ecosystem of the semi-arid Horqin sandy steppe. Short-term cultivation resulted in a 18-38% reduction in concentration of soil organic C, and total N and P in the 0-15 cm plow layer. Cultivation had a significant influence on N and P availability and soil biological properties, with lower basal soil respiration (BSR) and enzyme activities than the grassland soils. This was mostly due to strong wind erosion when sandy grassland was cultivated. Data indicated a considerable difference in soil particle size distribution between the cultivated and grassland soils, and fine fraction (<O.1 mm) in the cultivated soil was lower than that in the grassland soils. Moreover, grassland vegetation recovery in the 5RGS resulted in significant improvement in soil properties measured at the 0-7.5 cm depth. From the perspective of soil resource management and environmental conservation, a viable option for these sandy grasslands would be to stop conversion of grassland to cropland and adopt proper fencing practices to limit overgrazing.

AB Wind erosion of soils generates fine particulates that are health hazards (PM10 and PM2.5) by three major processes: entrainment (emission) of loose mobile aggregates from the surface, abrasion from immobile clods/crusts, and breakage of mobile saltation/creep aggregates. To improve prediction of PM10 generation in erosion models, parameters must be established for these processes. The objectives of this research were to measure relative breakage fractions of saltation-size aggregates to suspension-size and thefractions of PM10 and PM2.5 generated by the breakage process for a range of soils. Soil samples were collected from nine states (Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). Sub-samples of the soils were used to determine organic matter and calcium carbonate fractions. Other sub-samples were dispersed to determine sand, silt, and clay fractions. The breakage process was simulated in the laboratory by repeated impacts of saltation-size aggregates in an enclosed chamber Relative breakage fractions averaged 0.044 for aggregates with saltation-size sand/clay ratios between 0.1 and 10. Fractions for aggregates with either large clay or saltation-size sand fractions were significantly less, averaging 0.015. The fraction of PM10 in the suspension component created by breakage (SF10(bk)) averaged 0.049 over all soils. The SF10(bk) was inversely proportional to both clay content and annual precipitation. Average SF10(bk) was 0.069 with clay fraction <0.1, but significantly lower (0.030) with clay fraction >0.1. The average ratio of PM2.5/PM10 was 0.154, but increased with saltation-size sand/clay ratio and decreased with precipitation. The predicted values ranged from about 0.1 to 0.3 (R-2 = 0.53).

AB Agricultural carbon (C) sequestration may be one of the most cost-effective ways to slow processes of global warming. Numerous environmental benefits may result from agricultural activities that sequester soil C and contribute to environmental security. As part of no-regret strategies, practices that sequester soil C help reduce soil erosion and improve water quality and are consistent with more sustainable and less chemically dependent agriculture. While we learn more about soil C storage and its central role in direct environmental benefits, we must better understand soybean contributions to the secondary environmental benefits and what they mean to production agriculture. Increasing soil C storage can increase infiltration, increase fertility and nutrient cycling, decrease wind and water erosion, minimize compaction, enhance water quality, decrease C emissions, impede pesticide movement and generally enhance environmental quality. The sum of each individual benefit adds to a total package with major significance on a global scale. Incorporating C storage in conservation planning with soybean presents some challenges, but demonstrates concern for our global resources and presents a positive role for soil C that will have a major impact on our future quality of life.

AB Late Quaternary sections (1.2 Ma) of ODP-Site 1075 from the Congo deep-sea fan are investigated to reconstruct variations of terrigenous organic matter supply to the eastern equatorial Atlantic. To characterize the organic matter (OM) with regard to marine and terrigenous amounts we used elemental analysis (C, N, S), stable carbon isotopes (bulk delta(13)C(org)), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and terrigenous biomarkers (lignin phenols from CuO oxidation). The records of total organic carbon (TOC) contents, C-org/N-tot ratios, bulk OM degradation rates (C-org/C-org*), and the ratios of hydrocarbons (HC) from low-mature versus HC from high-mature OM (lm/hm) reveal pronounced cyclic changes in OM abundance, preservation, and reactivity that are closely related to the precessional controlled record of insolation, and thus, to variations in upwelling intensity and fluvial run-off. Primary productivity off the Congo is stimulated by both, enhanced nutrient supply in response to trade-induced upwelling during arid African climates (insolation minima) and fluvial nutrient delivery during humid stages (following insolation maxima), especially due to the contribution of dissolved silica that is taken up preferably by diatoms. However, results stemming from a multiparameter approach reveal that the fluvial supply of degraded OM and black carbon (BC) associated with fine-grained sediments from soil erosion is a decisive factor for the preservation of marine OM and, in addition, significantly influences the geochemical signature of bulk and terrigenous OM. Riverine and eolian supply of C-4 plant matter, as well as enhanced concentrations of BC, during arid and arid-to-humid transitional climate stages, may lead to a severe underestimation of terrigenous organic carbon, if its amount is calculated from bulk isotopic ratios using binary end-member models. During the humid stages, it is the massive supply of C-13-enriched soil OM with low C-org/N-tot ratios that may suggest a mainly marine composition of bulk OM. In fact, terrigenous OM governs bulk OM geochemical signatures in the sediments of the Congo deep-sea fan, a result that is contradictory to earlier studies, especially to the conventional interpretation of the bulk delta(13)C(org) signal.

AB Livestock grazing is recognised as one of the main causes of vegetation and soil degradation/desertification in the semi-arid Horqin sandy steppe of northern China. In this paper, soil-plant system carbon (C) in a representative degraded sandy grassland in the Horqin sandy steppe (42degrees58' N, 120degrees42'E altitude c. 360 m a.s.l.) was measured. Three situations: long-term continuous grazing (CG), exclosure for 5 years (5EX), and exclosure for 10 years (10EX), were compared to assess the effect of grazing management on C sequestration. Ground cover increased from the CG (35%) to the 5EX (63%) and to the 10EX (81%), and accordingly soil organic C at 0-15 cm depth and total plant components C increased from the CG (492 and 98 g m(-2)) to the 5EX (524 and 134 g m(-2)) and to the 10EX (584 and 317 g m(-2)). The results suggested that continuous grazing in the erosion-prone sandy grassland is very detrimental to vegetation and soil. Under exclosure conditions, vegetation restoration and litter accumulation significantly increased plant-soil system C storage, and thus sequestration of atmospheric C. It was concluded that the degraded sandy grassland could contribute to significant C sequestration with the implementation of protective practices.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of erosion simulated by removal of surface soil layers and the effect of rainfall erosion on wheat and soybean productivity. Thickness of soil layers removed artificially to simulate erosion effects were 0 cm, 3 cm, 6 cm and 14 cm, representing the entire Ap horizon. Wheat productivity did not allow to establish any correlation with thickness of removed soil. The reduction of soybean productivity was, 148 kg ha(-1) and 105 kg ha(-1) per cm of soil removed, in 0 to 6 cm and 0 to 14 cm layers, respectively. Cation exchange capacity and Ca+Mg content, in different soil depth, were the soil attributes. that most influenced soybean productivity. Organic carbon content was the only soil attribute to correlate with soybean and wheat yields, in both, rainfall and simulated erosion conditions. Simulation of erosion effect on soybean yield by removal of different soil surface layers can be used, once the difference on soybean productivity compared to the same soil layer lost by natural erosion was less than 6%.

AB The rate of development of topsoil is an important characteristic for soil resilience and sustainable use. We located a chronosequence (1-59 yr) of recovering landslip scars in erodible siltstone hill country under permanent pasture for sheep farming in New Zealand. We measured the rates of recovery in microbial C, respiration, catabolic diversity, phosphatase, sulphatase and invertase activities, pH, total C, total N, C/N ratio, potentially mineralizable N, total P, Olsen P, cation-exchange capacity, bulk density, particle density, porosity, available water and aggregate stability (0-10 cm depth). A subset of the same sites was sampled again after a 14-yr interval, enabling us to test whether rates of change estimated by resampling the same sites were the same as those estimated from a single time sample from the chronosequence (the space-for-time hypothesis).
   Most topsoil characteristics had recovered to 71-85% of those in the non-slipped sites after 59 yr. Exceptions were soil respiration, invertase and sulphatase activities, and bulk density, which recovered to 94-110% of the values of the non-slipped sites. There was little change in soil pH, total P, Olsen P, exchangeable cations and water storage along the chronosequence. An asymptote model fitted the patterns of recovery in biochemical characteristics, organic matter, bulk density and particle density. Recovery (to 90% of the asymptote value) was most rapid for the C/N ratio (5 yr) and longest for particle density (79 yr); most other characteristics fell in an 18-50 yr range. Overall, a single sampling of a chronosequence of matched landslip scars was as reliable to estimate rates of recovery as was resampling individual sites through time. Total C and N were as effective as more complicated biochemical measures to monitor the recovery of topsoil. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon (C) sequestration in soil implies enhancing the concentrations/pools of soil organic matter and secondary carbonates. It is achieved through adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) on soils of agricultural, grazing, and forestry ecosystems, and conversion of degraded soils and drastically disturbed lands to restorative land use. Of the 916 million hectares (Mha) comprising the total land area in the continental United States and Alaska, 157 Mha (17.1%) are under cropland, 336 Mha (36.7%) under grazing land, 236 Mha (25.8%) under forest, 14 Mha (1.5%) under Conservation Reserve Programs (CRP), and 20 Mha (2.2%) are under urban land use. Land areas affected by different soil degradative processes include 52 Mha affected by water erosion, 48 Mha by wind erosion, 0.2 Mha by secondary salinization, and more than 4 Mha affected by mining. Adoption of RMPs can lead to sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) at an annual rate of 45 to 98 Tg (teragram = 1 X 10(12) g = 1 million metric tons or MMT) in cropland, 13 to 70 Tg in grazing land, and 25 to 102 Tg in forestlands. In addition, there is an annual soil C sequestration potential of 21 to 77 Tg by land conversion, 25 to 60 Tg by land restoration, and 15 to 25 Tg by management of other land uses. Thus, the total potential of C sequestration in soils of the United States is 144 to 432 Tg/y or an average of 288 Tg C/y. With the implementation of suitable policy initiatives, this potential is realizable for up to 30 years or when the soil C sink capacity is filled. In comparison, emission by agricultural activities is estimated at: 43 Tg C/y, and the current rate of SOC sequestration is reported as 17 Tg C/y. The challenge the policy makers face is to be able to develop and implement policies that are conducive to realization of this potential.

AB Erosion changes soil properties, especially physical properties, mainly because it removes surface soil rich in organic materials and exposes lower soil layers. In 1988, a study was established to determine the effects of soil erosion and long-term manure applications on selected soil physical properties and corn (Zea mays L.) production. After 10 years of annual manure applications, soil core samples were collected in 7.6-cm increments at three depths, 0 to 7.6, 15 to 22.6, and 30 to 37.6 cm, to determine soil bulk density (rho(b)), hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil (K-s), and water retention. Bulk density and K-s increased slightly with erosion level. Water retention did not change in the surface 7.6 cm, but it did decrease with increasing erosion level at deeper depths. Long-term application of manure decreased rho(b) by 10%, whereas K-s was doubled in the top 7.6 cm of soil. Manure increased soil-water retention capacity and decreased differences in water retention between erosion levels, especially at low suctions (0 to 20 kPa). Soil carbon content correlated wen with water retention and rho(b) Corn grain yields in 1997, 1998, and 1999 were 15, 6, and 14% less, respectively, in the severe than in the slight erosion phase. Long-term manure additions increased corn grain yields by 19% in 1998 and by 25% in 1999. Increased yield from manure additions was likely related to an enhancement in water retention. Results from this study show that long-term manure application is a possible management alternative for restoring the physical properties and crop productivity of eroded soil.

AB The range of soil properties associated with soil taxonomic class results from natural soil formation and soil-changing effects of human activity. My goal was to assess cultivation effects on soil formation and soil organic carbon (SOC) at four cultivated and two native hummocky till sites from the same climatic region of Saskatchewan. A revised landform segmentation procedure was used for comparisons across sites. Neither A horizon thickness nor SOC was related to topographical attributes at the native sites, but both had significant relationships (P=0.001) with profile curvature (Pearson r=-0.53 and -0.57 for A horizon thickness and SOC, respectively), specific dispersal area (r=-0.40 and -0.54) and plan curvature (r=-0.24 and -0.34) at the cultivated sites. The greatest decreases in A horizon thickness (16 cm) and SOC (56 Mg ha(-1)) at the cultivated sites occurred in divergent shoulder elements, which have high rates of tillage-induced soil loss. Increases in soil thickness (including depth to calcium carbonate) occurred in concave footslope and depressional elements, but in situ losses of SOC outweighed the effects of SOC deposition. Soil thinning caused increases in the proportion of Orthic Regosols and decreases in the proportion of Calcareous Chernozems, but horizonation changes in the dominant Orthic Chernozems were minor. The self-terminating nature of the horizonation changes and improved conservation measures suggest that the future rate of soil change in these landscapes may be lower than in the past.

AB Chinese loess-palaeosol sequences are well known for their records of monsoonal climatic variations. However, the modern processes of dust accumulation and soil formation remain poorly understood. A high-resolution investigation on modern soils, including the measurement of magnetic susceptibility, particle-size distribution, total Fe, total organic carbon, CaCO3 content, and optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was carried out on the Zhouyuan loess tableland in the southern Loess Plateau. The results indicate that modern cinnamon soils (luvisols) have developed on contemporarily accumulated aeolian dust during the Holocene. The aeolian loess accumulated during the Younger Dryas was identified in the top part of the Malan Loess that underlay the modem soil by OSL dating and proxy climatic data. It indicates that the Malan Loess accumulated during the last glaciation (marine isotope stages 2-4) does not serve as the parent material for the modem soils. Pedogenesis of the soils started with the increased precipitation and soil moisture that have occurred on the loess tableland since the early Holocene. Precipitation-driven pedogenesis and organic activities are responsible for the leaching of CaCO3, decomposition of mineral dust and the production of clay and ferromagnetic minerals. Drier intervals have interrupted soil formation several times, and therefore profiles with multiple soils have been developed at many sites on the loess tableland. At places where soil erosion was relatively strong, either a single soil or welded soils are preserved in the Holocene profiles. This does not necessarily mean, however, that modern soils over the plateau have been developed without interruption under a constantly warmer, moister climate. This is significant for understanding the surface processes and climatic variation during the formation of the numerous palaeosols over the Loess Plateau in the Quaternary.

AB Many studies have focused on desertification processes in northern China in an attempt to understand desertification-related ecological problems. Desertification on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has received little attention, even though desertification resulting from overgrazing is a widespread phenomenon there. This study focuses on the Gonghe Basin in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, located on the northeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, to shed light on desertification processes and associated environmental impacts during a 10-year period from 1987 to 1996. We first used 2 thematic mapper images to classify land cover for 2 summers (1987 and 1996) into 9 land cover types related to desertification. To assess the severity of desertification and to calculate the total soil carbon emission caused by desertification, we first defined severity by comparing land cover differences between 1987 and 1996 and then determined the differences in organic carbon content of the soil in grasslands during different stages of desertification between 1987 and 1996. The results showed that about 240 km(2) of grasslands was lost to agricultural encroachment and about 190 km(2) became sand-covered area between 1987 and 1996. During the same period, desertification affected 569.6 km(2) of grasslands, with desertification assessed as very severe for 41.8%, severe for 15.1%, and Moderate for 43.1% of the area, The results also show that carbon emissions from grassland deterioration caused by desertification amounted to 2.06 x 10(6) tC during the 10-year period, the average annual emission rate being 0.206 x 10(6) tC.

AB Soil erosion and the gradual acidification of soils are two major obstacles limiting crop productivity in the Palouse region of eastern Washington and northern Idaho. New tillage practices that replace the traditional moldboard plow are needed to maintain more surface cover to reduce erosion. Two tillage systems and lime were compared at two locations on silt loam soils. Treatment combinations were two levels of tillage (subsoil ridge till (SSRT) and plowing) and two levels of lime (0 and 2.68 Mg ha(-1)). Crop rotations were barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-pea (Pisum sativum L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at both sites in the US that receive 500-560 mm precipitation annually. Tillage and lime options were implemented after barley stubble and studied for 2 years. Microbial biomass, respiration, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity were enhanced at the Washington site under SSRT because of the initially higher residue levels and because residues were maintained at or near the soil surface compared to plowing. Liming increased soil pH and respiration and maintained microbial biomass at about 100 ug C g(-1) higher than for the unlimed plots at the end of 2 years. Soil moisture increased under SSRT at some profile depths. Pea seed yield at the Washington site and wheat yield at the Idaho site were significantly higher for SSRT compared to plowing. Lime significantly increased wheat yield only at the Washington site. Significantly higher surface residue was maintained during the study period from SSRT compared to plowing which contributed to lower rates of soil erosion in winter wheat 30 months after plot establishment. At the Washington site, surface residue levels were 20% in spring of 1992 for SSRT compared to less than 1% for plowing. One year later, soil erosion under winter wheat in spring of 1993 was 1.3 Mg ha(-1) for SSRT compared to 8.4 Mg ha(-1) for plowing. In general, the higher surface residue maintained under SSRT increased microbial activity, maintained higher surface residue, and reduced erosion in winter wheat, the vulnerable phase in the crop rotation for erosion.

AB Soil organic matter contents (SOM) of soils of the Semiarid Pampas of Argentina (SAP), mostly Entic Haplustolls, increase with the amount of silt+clay, but it is still not known how soil texture affects its qualitative composition in interaction with climatic and management conditions. Because of that the organic matter content of the following aggregate size fractions were determined: < 2000 mum (SOM), 100-2000 mum (YOM), < 100 mum (HOM), water floatable organic matter (FOM), and the E4/E6 quotient. These fractions were studied in the 20-cm topsoils of seven REFERENCE (virgin Caldenal savanna-like soils), and 10 CULTIVATED soils (under continuous conventional tillage since more than 50 years). Results showed that SOM of both REFERENCE and CULTIVATED soils was mainly composed by YOM (57%), and to a lesser extent by HOM (37%) and FOM (5%). Silt+clay conditioned positively the contents of SOM, YOM and HOM of both REFERENCE (R-2=0.18, R-2=0.21, R-2=0.21, respectively, n=21, p<0.05) and CULTIVATED soils (R-2=0.62, R-2=0.44, R-2=0.52, respectively, n=30, p<0.001). The positive relationship existing between silt+clay and both SOM and YOM seems to be not longer valid in sites with mean annual temperatures (MAT) higher than 17 C. YOM and HOM accumulation were positively affected by precipitation and negatively by temperature in combination with silt+clay. This effect was more pronounced for HOM. The slopes of the regressions between SOM, HOM and YOM with silt+clay were more pronounced for REFERENCE soils than for CULTIVATED soils, indicating the largest absolute losses of these organic matter fractions in fine- rather than in coarse-textured soils. E4/E6 quotients were lower than 5 in all studied soils indicating that humic rather than fulvic acids exist in the well humified organic fraction of the studied soils. Contents of FOM and E4/E6 values did not correlated with the climatic conditions nor with soil texture or management. Potential SOM losses can be larger in fine-textured soils (up to 54.3 Mg C ha(-1)) than in coarse-textured (up to 35.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Probable changes of soil texture by wind erosion will modify absolute contents of SOM, YOM and HOM, while modifications of temperature or rains regimes will affect HOM more.

AB In the central highlands of Mexico, mesquite ( Prosopis spp) and huisache ( Acacia tortuoso), N-2 fixing trees or shrubs, dominate the vegetation and are used in an alley cropping system to prevent erosion and restore soil fertility. We investigated how much the leaves of both trees contribute to dynamics of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil by adding leaves of both species to soil sampled under the canopy of mesquite and huisache, outside their canopy and from fields cultivated with maize at three different sites and monitoring microbial biomass C, production of carbon dioxide (CO2), and dynamics of inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) in an aerobic incubation. The soluble fraction and N content of the mesquite leaves were larger than in the huisache leaves, but lignin and polyphenol content were lower. Evolution of CO2 increased 2.7-times when mesquite and 2.4-times when huisache leaves were added to soil. During all stages of decomposition and in all treatments, C mineralization of leaves from mesquite was greater than from huisache leaves. Mesquite leaves induced an increase in mineral N of 25.6 mg N kg(-1) soil after 56 days and those of huisache 9.8 mg N kg(-1). Twenty-six percent of N from mesquite leaves and 11% of huisache was mineralized, if no priming effect was considered. Nitrogen release from the leaves was greater when the soil organic matter content was lower. It was found that soil under the canopy of mesquite and huisache effectively accumulated organic material, micro-organisms and valuable nutrients. In an alley cropping system huisache might be a better choice than mesquite as huisache grows faster than mesquite and sheds its leaves twice a year while mesquite only once, although the amount of N mineralized was larger from mesquite leaves than from those of huisache.

AB The concentrations of beryllium (Be) in surface waters are presented for major water quality surveys of eastern UK rivers, based on extensive work within a major environmental programme, the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS). Two measurements were made, one for dissolved Be (i.e. the fraction that can pass through 0.45-mum membrane filters) the other for acid available total Be (dissolved Be plus the fraction of particulate Be that can be leached by a 1% v/v concentrated nitric acid solution). Dissolved Be concentrations are generally less than I mug l(-1) with a mean of approximately 0.02 mug l(-1), but higher values occur across the eastern UK rivers between 16th October and 7th November 1995 under neutral to alkaline conditions where Be would not be expected to be mobile. The higher values vary from river to river and there is a marked increase from north to south with particularly high concentrations (up to 29 mug l(-1)) for the industrial and urban impacted rivers of the southern Humber basin. The results show a major increase in dissolved Be at a time of exceptional drought conditions and climate instability, which seems to be linked to industrial/urban catchment systems. The average dissolved Be flux is 0.22 g ha(-1) year(-1) with a range in mean across the sites of 0.08-0.45 g ha(-1) year(-1). Without the period of enhanced Be concentrations, the Be flux through the period would have been approximately 40% less. There is no clear distinction between the dissolved Be flux for the rural and urban/industrial catchment systems. Acid available particulate Be (AAP(Be)) concentrations are low across the eastern UK rivers, they range between 0 and 1.33 mug l(-1) with a mean of 0.02 mug l(-1) and the highest concentrations occur for the industrial/urban rivers (approximately twice the levels occurring within the rural rivers). The AAP(Be), Concentrations are linearly correlated with the concentrations of suspended sediment, particulate organic carbon, particulate nitrogen, particulate phosphorus, and the AAP for several transition metals (Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni and Y), and the lanthanides. This reflects the nature of the catchment sources of particulate material (soil erosion and pollutant sources) and the hydrogeochemistry of Be with the high potential for hydrolysis and hydrogen bonding due to its small atomic size and high surface charge density. The acid available particulate flux averages approximately 0.42 g ha(-1) year(-1) with a range in mean across the sites of 0.14-1.2 g ha(-1) year'. The highest flux occurs for a river with a flood plain contaminated by spoil from historic mining of lead-zinc deposits, but there is no clear separation between the rural and the industrial/urban impacted catchments. The results indicate a potential and most unexpected dissolved Be stress to lowland aquatic environments, a stress that might well increase over time for the UK given the increasing climate instability within the country. The findings are linked to other information on Be in surface waters for other UK surface waters, including previously unpublished data, to allow a broader perspective for UK riverine environments. Information is provided on Be levels in acidic upland streams in mid Wales (upper River Severn), other eastern UK rivers (collected towards the end of the LOIS initiative) and drainage waters from a disused tin wine in Cornwall (Wheal Jane Mine).

AB Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical freshwater lake, is an important resource, ecologically and economically. THg distribution in the northern parts of the lake are not well known, so to answer this gap, patterns in total mercury (THg) in water, soil and two dated sediment cores from northern Lake Victoria were determined. Water THg concentrations ranged from 0.7 to 5.8 ng/L, and there were no apparent differences observed between Napoleon and Winam Gulfs. Two precipitation samples had Hg concentrations of 7 and 31 ng/L. Surface soil samples collected from various agricultural sites around Jinja, Napoleon Gulf, have THg concentrations between 12.7 and 48.4 ng/g dry weight; they were correlated with organic carbon, total phosphorus and % clay. A near-shore core taken in Itome Bay in Napoleon Gulf, and an offshore core collected from the deepest part of the lake had similar THg concentrations and profiles (78 to 458 ng/g dry weight). The increase in THg concentration in the profiles of both cores began around 1960 and peaked around 1980. The similar sedimentary THg profiles and fluxes in the cores suggest that the THg sources to L. Victoria are primarily atmospheric, with some erosion inputs, and that equatorial African ecosystems are not exempt from the global increase in baseline THg concentrations.

ID TILLAGE
AB The Bocage in the western part of Europe is an ancient rural landscape characterized by a network of hedgerows. The system studied here consists of hedges growing on earth and stone banks, which are found in the Armorican Niassif (western France). Seven sites were analysed, which represented a large, but not complete, set of situations. We investigated the influence of hedges parallel to contour lines on soil characteristics, soil profile morphology and carbon storage at the hillslope scale. The analysis is based on a morphological description of the soil catena from the top of the hill to downslope of the hedge, and on measurements of bulk density and organic carbon in different soil profiles on the slopes. The results show that thickness of the organic horizon increases slowly from the top of the hill as far as the hedge, whereas under the hedge the bulk density is low and the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage large. Two effects of the hedges on SOC storage are apparent, namely, a local effect under the hedge, due to tree activity, and an anti-erosive effect at the hillslope scale. A rough approximation based on these data assessed the fraction of SOC storage attributed to the hedge network of between 13 and 38% of the total carbon stock.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered to be key to sustainability of agriculture in the tropics. In southern Brazil, no-tillage has been adopted widely to control soil erosion, but its impact on the dynamics of SOM is not well established. We measured soil carbon (C) and delta(13)C in two crop rotations, one of which contained C4 maize (Zea mays L.), after 21 years of contrasting tillage (conventional tillage versus no-tillage). Adjacent sites that reflected historic land-uses were also sampled. In the tillage experiment there was no effect of tillage on the total amount of C in the 0-40 cm profile (even when contrasting bulk density was accounted for), and the concentration of C differed only in the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm layers. However, the occasional input of C4 material in the maize rotation resulted in a significant effect of rotation on delta(13)C (P<0.001). Using C-13 as a tracer for the SOM formed since the start of the experiment, we estimated the abundance of 'recent' and 'old' C within each depth interval. We found the main effect of tillage was to increase the medium-term turnover of SOM, particularly in the subsoil (i.e. below 20 cm depth). Compared with no-tillage, there was almost five times more recent C in the subsoil, and 20% more recent C in the 0-40 cm profile as a whole.

AB Soil conservation in South Africa has historically focused on preventing soil erosion. Effective maintenance of the soil requires, in addition to erosion control, an understanding of how land-use practices affect more subtle indicators of soil quality. This review outlines how land use in South Africa can rapidly result in a marked reduction in soil organic matter (SOM) content and increased tendency of soils to crust. Removal of a cover of vegetation, whether by ploughing, grazing or burning, tends to reduce SOM due to reduced inputs of organic matter and enhanced activity of soil microbes. Loss of SOM, particularly from the top few centimetres of soil (named here the pedoderm), has a disproportionately large effect on soil infiltrability and nutrient supply. The mineralogy of the clay fraction also has great bearing on the response of soil to land-use effects. The unexpected role of quartz in soil dispersion and crusting in South Africa has only recently been revealed. Apart from SOM effects, land use can lead to subtle changes in soil chemistry. Plantation forestry has resulted in an increase in soil nitrate in many areas, possibly due to greater mineralization under forests than grasslands. Annual burning in the Kruger National Park bushveld has been shown to increase clay dispersibility and crusting of the pedoderm, which was ascribed to a reduction in electrical conductivity and SOM as well as to an increase in the exchangeable sodium percentage. Soil quality is a multifaceted concept. One aspect stands out, however, as critical and that is the conservation and replenishment of nitrogen, which is all-important for retaining humus and maintaining soil quality.

AB The chemical composition of riverine suspended. sediment is the integration of the weathering crust minerals, soil organic matter and erosion agency within a specific drainage basin, which has been largely disturbed by the human activities. Selected metal elements of the riverine suspended sediment in the Zhujiang River were analysed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) in three different hydrological phases from 1997 to 1998 at Makou and Sanshui hydrographic gauge stations, located at the lower reaches of the two main tributaries of the Zhujiang River, i.e. the Xijiang and the Beijing Rivers respectively. Organic carbon and nitrogen were also analysed using a conventional element analyser. The results demonstrate that the chemical composition of the riverine suspended sediment show obvious variability in different hydrological phases, which closely correlate to the organic matter content in suspended sediment. Intensified erosion in the flood phase results in lower concentration of the organic matter than that in the lower water level phase. The riverine suspended sediment with rich organic matter in the lower water level phase adsorbs some metal elements from the river water. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DE chemical property; (CS)-C-137; soil erosion
ID QUANTITATIVE MODEL; EROSION; RATES
AB The Cs-137 spatial redistribution data have been widely used to estimate soil redistribution rates over the past 45 years approximately. However, the frequent changes in land use in China have limited the general application of the Cs-137 tracer technique to soil erosion or deposition budget on the mid-/long-term. In this paper, Soil Cs-137 measurements and some chemical properties, such as the soil organic carbon and available phosphorus contents, were simultaneously used to identify sediment sources and to reveal the spatial characteristics of soil redistribution. The deposition rates after and before the changes in local land use could be estimated using the approach proposed in this study. The reclamation of formerly uncultivated slopes was found to lead not only to striking accelerated soil erosion but also to considerable changes in the slope form. A typical footslope site on 5-year-old reclaimed sloping land which appeared to have experienced net erosion before 1997, has become a site with deposition reaching a rate of 3.0 cm year(-1) since 1997. Besides the soil Cs-137 activity, the soil organic carbon content was found to be a very meaningful indicator of the extent of soil erosion or deposition, and the significant difference in the soil available phosphorus content between uncultivated and cultivated land could become a very sensitive and suitable criterion for identifying sediment sources under different land uses.

AB Temperature and precipitation affect crop residue decomposition rate. Degree-days (DGD) and decomposition-days (DCD) are used to account for the effect of temperature and precipitation, but little information is available about winter cover crop (WCC) residue decomposition as a function of DCD or DGD. This study was conducted to model the decomposition of rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) residues and the subsequent release of C and N under field conditions using DGD and DCD. Rye and hairy vetch WCCs were planted during the fall either in monoculture or biculture and killed before corn (Zea mays L.) planting. Grab samples of WCC residues were taken six times during the corn growing season. A single-pool exponential decay function was used to model biomass decomposition and C and N release. Most decay models showed coefficients of determination (r(2)) larger than 0.7. Both DGD and DCD were equally effective as time scales. Winter cover crops differed in their initial biomass and C content and in their biomass decomposition and C and N release rates. At corn V6 stage, 33 and 75% of the initial N content had been released from rye and hairy vetch residues, respectively. At the end of the growing season, hairy vetch had almost completely decomposed while 5% of the initial biomass of rye remained undecomposed. Decomposition dynamics of hairy vetch residue indicate that it is a potential source of N while decomposition dynamics of rye indicate that it is more useful in soil conservation.

AB This paper describes a dynamic simulation model that integrates environmental and economic components of agricultural crop production systems to predict changes in soil quality and the concomitant impact on economic returns. The model is used to simulate crop yield, soil quality and economic performance of a conventional crop rotation and several alternative crop rotations in two contrasting environments in western Canada over a 50-year period. This information is used to quantify the impact of the crop rotations on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the economic value of on-site SOC changes. The estimated value of these impacts range from $0.20/t to $2.10/t of SOC/ha/yr.

AB Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. Land area globally affected by erosion is 1094 million ha (Mha) by water erosion, of which 751 Mha is severely affected, and 549 Mha by wind erosion, of which 296 Mha is severely affected. Whereas the effects of erosion on productivity and non-point source pollution are widely recognized, those on the C dynamics and attendant emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are not. Despite its global significance, erosion-induced carbon (C) emission into the atmosphere remains misunderstood and an unquantified component of the global carbon budget. Soil erosion is a four-stage process involving detachment, breakdown, transport/redistribution and deposition of sediments. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is influenced during all four stages. Being a selective process, erosion preferentially removes the light organic fraction of a low density of < 1.8 Mg/m(3). A combination of mineralization and C export by erosion causes a severe depletion of the SOC pool on eroded compared with uneroded or slightly eroded soils. In addition, the SOC redistributed over the landscape or deposited in depressional sites may be prone to mineralization because of breakdown of aggregates leading to exposure of hitherto encapsulated C to microbial processes among other reasons. Depending on the delivery ratio or the fraction of the sediment delivered to the river system, gross erosion by water may be 75 billion Mg, of which 15-20 billion Mg are transported by the rivers into the aquatic ecosystems and eventually into the ocean. The amount of total C displaced by erosion on the earth, assuming a delivery ratio of 10% and SOC content of 2-3%, may be 4.0-6.0 Pg/year. With 20% emission due to mineralization of the displaced C, erosion-induced emission may be 0.8-1.2 Pg C/year on the earth. Thus, soil erosion has a strong impact on the global C cycle and this component must be considered while assessing the global C budget. Adoption of conservation-effective measures may reduce the risks of C emission and sequester C in soil and biota. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Nsimi experimental catchment (area: 0.60 km(2), latitude: 3degrees10'N, 120 km SSE from Yaounde) has been selected for a study of the humid tropical area dynamics. With a mean rainfall of 1700 mm/yr, and a slightly degraded vegetal cover, this site is representative of the South-Cameroon forest domain. Whereas the slopes correspond to a thick lateritic profile, the swampy depression (representing 20% of the surface) is recovered by a clayey-sandy level enriched in organic matter on its upper part. Successive chemical analyses (major cations and anions, total iron and aluminium, dissolved silica, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) of water samples from different reservoirs, from springs and outlets enabled us to have a better understanding of the dynamics of this small watershed. (1) Two types of water can be distinguished: clear waters, collected from the slope water tables and from the springs; coloured waters, which have flowed through the depression. This difference has been imputed to the DOC content (near 16 mg/l in the coloured waters). (2) The strong DOC ratio in the depression water table may be responsible for its relatively high cation concentration: In these slow flowing waters, the abundance of dissolved organic matter has a notable effect on the solubility of some mineral species. (3) Nevertheless, all these waters present extremely low dissolved concentrations indicating that chemical weathering is very slow within the lateritic profile, even at its bottom.

AB Due to severe land degradation problems, soil conservation is a matter of major concern in the Ecuadorian Andes. Slow-forming terraces, a variation of hedgerow agro-forestry systems composed by contour grass barrier strips, can be considered as the most frequently used technique in Andean rural communities of Ecuador. However, due to shallow soils, terrace development often has the disadvantage causing gradients in soil properties from the upper to the lower elevations within the terrace. The main objectives of this study were to assess (i) spatial variability in soil properties on slow-forming terraces in the Andes and (ii) implications of variability for the management of this soil conservation technique. In order to measure spatial variability, soil sampling (0-15 cm) was carried out in bands following the contour, which were located every I m beginning at the highest point of elevation and including the lowest point on the terrace. Soil properties, such as pH(H2O), pH(NaF), organic carbon, total nitrogen, NO3-, P, K, exchangeable aluminium, P fixation, exchangeable bases, cationic exchange capacity, base saturation and texture, were monitored on eight terraces, having slopes from 15 to 30%, a length of 4-8 m and soils ranging from Cambisols to Phaeozems, in the Ecuadorian Andes (Gima, Azuay). Terraces, which were 2-4 years, were managed in a traditional or more intensified way (i.e. without or with the application of organic manure). Bufferstrips were composed by (i) Pennisetum clandestinum and Lolium multiflorum or (ii) Phalaris tuberosa. Spatial variability was analysed by stepwise multiple regression analysis, where position on the terrace was the independent variable and soil property was the dependent variable. Factor analysis was carried out in order to compare spatial variability patterns of the terraces and formulate management strategies. High spatial variability in soil properties was found. Although spatial variation was site dependent, it was clear that soil fertility increased from the upper to the lower part of the terraces. The present study shows that management strategy could influence the pattern and magnitude of spatial variation. Site-specific soil fertility improvement is suggested as means to combat variation caused by tillage erosion in slow-forming terraces. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil erosion and deposition may play important roles in balancing the global atmospheric carbon budget through their impacts on the net exchange of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Few models and studies have been designed to assess these impacts. In this study, we developed a general ecosystem model, Erosion-Deposition-Carbon-Model (EDCM), to dynamically simulate the influences of rainfall-induced soil erosion and deposition on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in soil profiles. EDCM was applied to several landscape positions in the Nelson Farm watershed in Mississippi, including ridge top ( without erosion or deposition), eroding hillslopes, and depositional sites that had been converted from native forests to croplands in 1870. Erosion reduced the SOC storage at the eroding sites and deposition increased the SOC storage at the depositional areas compared with the site without erosion or deposition. Results indicated that soils were consistently carbon sources to the atmosphere at all landscape positions from 1870 to 1950, with lowest source strength at the eroding sites (13 to 24 gC m(-2) yr(-1)), intermediate at the ridge top (34 gC m(-2) yr(-1)), and highest at the depositional sites (42 to 49 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). During this period, erosion reduced carbon emissions via dynamically replacing surface soil with subsurface soil that had lower SOC contents (quantity change) and higher passive SOC fractions (quality change). Soils at all landscape positions became carbon sinks from 1950 to 1997 due to changes in management practices (e.g., intensification of fertilization and crop genetic improvement). The sink strengths were highest at the eroding sites (42 to 44 gC m(-2) yr(-1)), intermediate at the ridge top (35 gC m(-2) yr(-1)), and lowest at the depositional sites (26 to 29 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). During this period, erosion enhanced carbon uptake at the eroding sites by continuously taking away a fraction of SOC that can be replenished with enhanced plant residue input. Overall, soil erosion and deposition reduced CO2 emissions from the soil into the atmosphere by exposing low carbon-bearing soil at eroding sites and by burying SOC at depositional sites. The results suggest that failing to account for the impact of soil erosion and deposition may potentially contribute to an overestimation of both the total historical carbon released from soils owing to land use change and the contemporary carbon sequestration rates at the eroding sites.

AB We investigated the influence of agricultural management and various plant covers related to the period of abandonment on soil properties, erosion and nutrient depletion in a typical Mediterranean area with sandy loam shallow soils. Cultivated soils (CS) with insufficient management, 5 year abandoned soils covered with meadow (A5), 25 year abandoned soils covered with dense scrubs (A25), 50 year abandoned soils covered with cork trees (A50) and soils in a 50 year pine reforested area (P50) were studied over a period of 6 months (May-October 1999). The soils were classified as Lithic Xerorthents. Both the differences in soil properties and response to rainfall events were mainly attributed to the different vegetation types and stages in land management. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the results, by running the overall data determined after five rainfall events. The factors extracted by PCA of the samples by variables matrix represented the response of the environments to different rainfall intensities as a function of management or natural evolution after abandonment. CS environments showed the highest runoff and sediment yield as well as the highest amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen in runoff water. The sequence of abandonment (A5, A25 and A50) showed approximately the same runoff production, whereas eroded sediments (ES) and DOC were inversely correlated. Organic carbon in the ES and DOC in runoff water always increased with the period of abandonment, which accounted for consistent nutrient depletion. Nevertheless, the A50 environment (dominated by Quercus suber) showed the best soil properties, whilst the A25 environment with dense cover of Cistus monspeliensis and Calicotome espinosa seemed to cause a worsening effect on the soil's physical and chemical properties. This is probably because these environments are more severely damaged by wild fire occurrence. In terms of sediment yield, the P50 environment followed CS environment, indicating that reforestation followed by insufficient forest management may negatively affect both soil properties and response to the erosive action of rainfall.

AB [1] We compute the particulate organic carbon (POC) yield of the Waipaoa River, New Zealand, using sediment rating curves in conjunction with measurements of the carbon content of the suspended sediment. To ascertain the source of the carbon and the extent to which the POC flux is tied to different erosion processes, we determined the stable isotopic carbon composition (delta(13)C) and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of weathered bedrock, soil, and regolith. Most POC is derived from suspended sediment generated by gully erosion (incision into weathered bedrock), supplemented by landsliding during extreme events. The specific yield of POC from the headwaters (drainage area 1580 km(2)) is 55 g m(-2) yr(-1), which is very high by global standards and by comparison with other turbid steep-land rivers. The annual loss to floodplain storage is similar to4% (3.6 Kt) of the mean annual POC yield (86.7 Kt). Thus the Waipaoa River is a very effective conduit for transporting POC to the ocean.

AB Soils in the Mediterranean area are very prone to erosion due to the loss of organic matter and the consequent lack of protective vegetation. In this experiment a Mediterranean degraded soil with a 15% slope was amended at a rate of 250 t ha(-1) wet weight with sewage sludge and with a mixture of sewage sludge and barley straw (70% carbon from sewage sludge and 30% from the straw) in order to study their influence on soil structure recovery and hence the soils's resistance to erosion processes. Both types of organic amendment led to an improvement in several soil properties (physical, biological, and microbiological) as a result of the spontaneous growth plant covering that became evident three months after amendment. This vegetation remained throughout the two years of the experiment and prevented the water erosion processes that normally precede soil degradation. Amendment by sewage sludge alone reduced soil loss by 80% compared with the control soil, while the mixture that included both sewage sludge and barley straw reduced losses by 84%, both reducing runoff by 57%. The amended soils showed increases in the percentage of stable aggregates, the levels of the total and water-soluble C fractions, microbial biomass C, basal respiration, and the activity of the different enzymes involved in the biogeochemical cycles of C, N, and P. The results confirm the usefulness of sewage sludge as an organic amendment for recovering damaged soils.

AB The soil quality paradigm was originally developed in the temperate region with the overarching objective of approaching air quality and water quality standards. Although holistic and systems-oriented, soil quality focused principally on issues arising from large nutrient and energy inputs to agricultural lands. Soil quality in the tropics, however, focuses on three overarching concerns: food insecurity, rural poverty and ecosystem degradation. Soil science in the tropics relies heavily on quantitative attributes of soils that can be measured. The emotional, value-laden and "measure everything" approach proposed by some proponents of the soil quality paradigm has no place in the tropics. Soil quality in the tropics must be considered a component of an integrated natural resource management framework (INRM). Based on quantitative topsoil attributes and soil taxonomy, the fertility capability soil classification (FCC) system is probably a good starting point to approach soil quality for the tropics and is widely used. FCC does not deal with soil attributes that can change in less than 1 year, but those that are either dynamic at time scales of years or decades with management, as well as inherent ones that do not change in less than a century. FCC attributes can be positive or negative depending on the land use as well as the temporal and spatial scales in question. Version 4 is introduced in this paper. The main changes are to include the former h condition modifier (acid, but not Al-toxic) with "no major chemical limitations" because field experience has shown little difference between the two and to introduce a new condition modifier m that denotes organic carbon saturation deficit. Additional modifiers are needed for nutrient depletion, compaction, surface sealing and other soil biological attributes, but there is no sufficient evidence to propose robust, quantitative threshold values at this time. The authors call on those actively involved in linking these attributes with plant growth and ecosystem functions to provide additional suggestions that would enhance FCC. The use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) shows great potential on a wide range of tropical soils. The evolution of soil science from a qualitative art into a

AB Mini-watersheds called Nong in Thai are geographical components of rainfed lowland rice culture in Northeast Thailand, and constitute distinct units in understanding environmental constraints for low and unstable rainfed rice production there. The toposequential variation of soil fertility and its relation to rice productivity within mini-watersheds, was examined by phytometry of sampled soils and field measurements of rice growth and yield. The phytometry experiment with irrigated potted rice using soils sampled from various rice fields within each mini-watershed, revealed that soil fertility as evaluated by rice dry matter production showed a 5 times difference among the fields at most. The difference in the soil fertility was ascribed primarily to that in nitrogen (N) supply capacity. which itself had a strong correlation with soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Accordingly, the biomass production of pot-grown rice was proportional to SOC content, which suggested the usefulness of SOC as an index for soil fertility evaluation. The effect of clay on the soil fertility was much less than that of SOC. The actual rice yield in each field also showed quite large field-to-field variation, most of which was explained by the SOC content, rice growth duration and fertilizer application rate even though water availability also affected the yield. The yield positively correlated with growth duration and hence with earlier transplanting. Both SOC and clay contents of fields showed steep gradients I with ascending field elevation within mini-watersheds, resulting in a marked toposequential distribution of rice yield. The toposequential distributions of SOC and clay contents imply that rice culture after deforestation accelerated soil erosion from upper to lower fields. The large toposequential gradient in soil fertility requires different resource and crop management for each toposequential position, in order to improve rice productivity of the mini-watershed as a whole.

AB We present a dataset including clay mineralogy, gamma-ray spectrometry, organic matter content and magnetic susceptibility of the Hettangian to lowest Sinemurian successions of Dorset and Somerset, southern UK (Blue Lias Formation, Bristol Channel and Wessex basins). In both areas, the clay assemblages comprise predominantly detrital illite, kaolinite and illite/smectite mixed layers. Clays probably originated from the erosion of the Hercynian massifs, the relative proportions of kaolinite and illite being modulated by arid-humid climatic fluctuations. The organic matter (OM) content (types II to IV) ranges up to 12% in both areas. A clear stratigraphical trend in clay mineral assemblages is apparent in Somerset, whereas in Dorset sharp contrasts between adjacent horizons and a greater dilution by carbonate mask the long-term evolution. Correlations between both areas based on similar vertical trends in clay mineral abundance support the suggestion of a hiatus within the angulata Zone of the Dorset succession. As expected, the kaolinite/illite ratio correlates with the Th/K ratio deduced from gamma-ray spectrometry. However, significant departures from the correlation occur in OM-rich intervals, suggesting that Th may be partly adsorbed on to OM particles. Surprisingly, high magnetic susceptibility correlates with abundant kaolinite, not with Ferich clays, indicating either that kaolinite is accompanied by a soil-inherited magnetisable phase (possibly iron oxide) or that illite-rich rocks are more strongly diluted by carbonate than are kaolinite-rich strata.

AB Increase in atmospheric concentration Of CO2 from 285 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in 1850 to 370ppm in 2000 is attributed to emissions of 270+/-30 Pg carbon (C) from fossil fuel combustion and 136+/-55 Pg C by land-use change. Present levels of anthropogenic emissions involve 6.3 Pg C by fossil fuel emissions and 1.8 Pg C by land-use change. Out of the historic loss of terrestrial C pool of 136+/-55 Pg, 78+/-12 Pg is due to depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool comprising 26+/-9 Pg due to accelerated soil erosion. A large proportion of the historic SOC lost can be resequestered by enhancing the SOC pool through converting to an appropriate land use and adopting recommended management practices (RMPs). The strategy is to return biomass to the soil in excess of the mineralization capacity through restoration of degraded/desertified soils and intensification of agricultural and forestry lands. Technological options for agricultural intensification include conservation tillage and residue mulching, integrated nutrient management, crop rotations involving cover crops, practices which enhance the efficiency of water, plant nutrients and energy use, improved pasture and tree species, controlled grazing, and judicious use of inptus. The potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 1-2 Pg C yr(-1) for the world, 0.3-0-6 Pg C yr(-1) for Asia, 0.2-0-5 Pg C yr(-1) for Africa and 0.1-0.3 Pg C yr(-1) for North and Central America and South America, 0.1-0.3 Pg C yr(-1) for Europe and 0.1-0.2 Po C yr(-1) for Oceania. Soil C sequestration is a win-win strategy; it enhances productivity, improves environment moderation capacity, and mitigates global warming. Copyright) (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID INTERRILL ERODIBILITY
AB The susceptibility of some soils in the high rainfall zone of Nigeria to soil erosion must be measured regularly for better soil management. A number of techniques have been adopted for the determination of this soil loss parameter. The aim of this study is to determine the soil characteristics that relate significantly to erodibility. Soil samples collected from 0-20 cm depth from 10 different locations in the upper rainforest area were analysed for particle size distribution, water-stable aggregates, exchangeable cations, organic carbon, soil dispersion and aggregating indices. The soils are mainly Acrisols, Nitosols, Gleysols and Ferralsol in the FAO classification while their textures are sands to sandy-clay-loam. They are very unstable in water as reflected in the higher values of WSA >0.50 mm and the mean-weight diameter that ranged from 0.50 to 2.03 mm. The dispersion ratio for the soils are between 0.26 and 0.69 while clay dispersion ratio also ranged from 0.24 to 0.80. Revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) crodibility model values (K) were from 0.03 to 0.06 Mg hMJ(-1) mm(-1). These parameters can be effectively used in predicting soil erodibility, though their predictability varied in ranking of soil erodibility. In spite of this variability these indices can be used for potential erosion hazard determination by agricultural extension staff to avoid crop failures and other negative influence of soil erosion. The soil parameters are easy to determine and will be a valuable instrument when faster approaches to erosion control measures are required. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Centaurea maculosa Lam. (spotted knapweed), a Eurasian perennial forb, has invaded disturbed and undisturbed semiarid grasslands in the western United States. In the past, success in controlling C. maculosa and restoring invaded areas has been limited. Most research has addressed chemical aspects of invasive species interactions with soils, while potential impacts of altered soil physical properties on C. maculosa's success has not been studied. We hypothesized that the persistence of C. maculosa in semiarid rangelands might reflect an ability to alter site conditions. The objective of this study was to compare selected soil physical properties under C. maculosa-dominated and native perennial grass-dominated areas on semiarid grassland. We used six field sites in western Montana containing adjacent plots dominated by C. maculosa and by native perennial grasses. Soil physical properties including particle size fractions, bulk density, and hydraulic and thermal properties, as well as total organic carbon content, of near-surface soils were measured for each vegetation type. Soil physical properties seldom differed between C. maculosa- and native grass- dominated areas. When soil physical properties differed, the differences were inconsistent within and among sites. Presence of C. maculosa did not alter surface soil characteristics at our six sites, thus its persistence on these semi-arid grasslands cannot be explained by an ability to alter near-surface soil characteristics.

AB Wind-erodible soil sediments are classified as aggregates and particles < 1 mm in diameter. Aggregate size has been reported to influence pesticide retention and behavior in the soil. Atrazine sorption and desorption isotherms were determined using batch equilibration methods for six aggregate sizes of Barnes loam (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplodol) and Brandt silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplodol) soils. Aggregate and particle sizes used in this study ranged from < 0.11 to > 1.7 mm, and atrazine concentrations ranged from 0.65 to 39.2 mumol L-1. The K-f values for the isotherms were calculated using the Freundlich equation. In the Barnes loam, Kf values were strongly positively correlated to aggregate size, particle size, and organic carbon (OC) content (P = 0.01 for each parameter), whereas in the Brandt silty clay loam, K-f values were less correlated to size and OC content (P greater than or equal to 0.1) but were better correlated to clay content and estimated specific surface area (P = 0.05 for each parameter). Desorption was hysteretic with about 18% more atrazine desorbed from smallest than from largest size fractions. At a concentration of 13.0 mumol L-1, the amount desorbed ranged from 9 to 13.7% of the initial amount of adsorbed atrazine after 5 d, whereas at 39.2 mumol L-1, the amount desorbed ranged from 10.3 to 16% of the amount adsorbed. These data indicate that wind-erodible size aggregates and particles could be a source of herbicide contamination of surface water.

AB The main scope of this study is to investigate parameters controlling chemical weathering rates for a large river system submitted to subarctic climate. More than 110 river water samples from the Mackenzie River system (northern Canada) have been sampled and analyzed for major and trace elements and Sr isotopic ratios in the dissolved phase. The three main morphological units are reflected in water chemistry. Rivers from the Canadian Shield are very dilute, dominated by silicate weathering (Millot et al., 2002), whereas the rivers of the Rocky and Mackenzie Mountains as well as the rivers of the sedimentary Interior Platform are dominated by carbonate weathering and are SO4 rich. Compared to the rivers of the Mackenzie and Rocky Mountains, the rivers of the interior plains are organic, silica, and Na rich and constitute the dominant input term to the Mackenzie River mainstream. Rivers of the Canadian Shield area do not significantly contribute to the Mackenzie River system. Using elemental ratios and Sr isotopic ratios, a mathematical inversion procedure is presented that distinguishes between solutes derived from silicate weathering and solutes derived from carbonate weathering. Carbonate weathering rates are mostly controlled by runoff, which is higher in the mountainous part of the Mackenzie basin. These rates are comparable to the carbonate weathering rates of warmer areas of the world. It is possible that part of the carbonate weathering is controlled by sulfide oxidative weathering, but its extent remains difficult to assess. Conversely to what was stated by Edmond and Huh (1997), overall silicate weathering rates in the Mackenzie basin are low, ranging from 0.13 to 4.3 tons/km(2)/yr (Na + K + Ca + Mg), and confirm the negative action of temperature on silicate weathering rates for river basins in cold climates. In contrast to what has been observed in other large river systems such as the Amazon and Ganges Rivers, silicate weathering rates appear 3 to 4 times more elevated in the plains than in the mountainous headwaters. This contradicts the "Raymo hypothesis" (Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992). Isotopic characterization of suspended material clearly shows that the higher weathering rates reported for the plains are not due to the weathering of fine sediments produced in the mountains (e.g., by glaciers) and deposited in the plains. Rather, the relatively high chemical denudation rates in the plains are attributed to lithology (uncompacted shales), high mechanical denudation, and the abundance of soil organic matter derived from incomplete degradation and promoting crystal lattice degradation by element complexation. The three- to fourfold factor of chemical weathering enhancement between the plains and mountains is similar to the fourfold factor of enhancement found by Moulton et al. (2000) between unvegetated and vegetated watershed. This study confirms the negative action of temperature on silicate weathering for cold climate but shows that additional factors, such as organic matter, associated with northern watersheds are able to counteract the effect of temperature. This acceleration by a factor of 4 in the plains is equivalent to a 6degreesC increase in temperature. Copyright (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In 1998, a 59-cm sediment box core (PLB98-2) was taken from the deepest part of Pyramid Lake (water depth = 106 m), Nevada. Age control for PLB98-2 was provided using a variety of approaches. Dried sediment samples were leached with 10% ultra-pure nitric acid and analyzed for their elemental concentrations using standard ICP techniques. The variations in elemental concentrations can be divided into two periods: one prior to European settlement and one influenced by anthropogenic activities. The concentrations of K, Al, Na, Zn, and Mn all began to increase after pre-European manipulation of the watershed in similar to1860, which indicates the increasing soil erosion in the watershed was due to deforestation and development. The highest concentrations of these elements and lithogenic elements such as P, Mg, Fe, Cu, Ba, and Si occurred during the flood event of the 1990s. The Pb enrichment times are similar to what has been observed in estuaries draining the western Sierra Nevada, but the Pb enrichments in Pyramid Lake are much less. The Ca, TOC, TIC, Sr, and Ba concentrations show a strong association that is closely related to drought-wet variations of climate and the construction of Derby Dam for water diversions in the early 1900s. Se concentrations vary with the delta(18)O of the carbonate in the sediments. Although the delta(18)O "leads" the other species and Truckee River discharge by a few years, it is an excellent indicator of the hydrological change of Pyramid Lake, which is related to climate changes and human activities. From similar to1920, Mn and Mo vary inversely in the sediments. In general, the Mo concentrations varies directly with the organic carbon content of the sediments from 1910 to similar to1980, suggesting enhanced removal of MID during times of increased productivity in the lake, and anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface. This coincides with low lake levels. The elemental. composition of the sediments in Pyramid Lake clearly reflect the timing of important anthropogenic activities and climatic variations that have taken place within the watershed over the past 240 years.

AB Surface horizons of Rhodic Paleudults in the Tenneswe Valley region of Alabama contain large amounts of clay (<2 mum) composed of quartz, kaolinite, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, and iron oxides. Similar clay mineralogical suites have been shown to be dispersive, which can lead to the degradation of soil physical properties. Furthermore, some studies have suggested mineralogical enrichment in dispersed colloids versus in situ soil, which can effect transport of sediment-attached pollutants. The historical utilization of conventional tillage practices without cover crops has degraded soil quality in this region; however, reduced tillage systems are becoming common. We evaluated clay dispersibility and mineralogical partitioning for fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Paleudults cropped to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in: (i) a no-till system without a cover crop (NT), (ii) a no-till system with a rye (Secale cerea e L.) cover crop (NTC), (iii) a no-till system with a rye cover crop and fall paratilling (NTCP), and (iv) a conventional tillage system (disking and chisel plowing in the fall followed by disking in spring) (CT). Water dispersible clay (WDC), extractable Fe, and soil organic carbon (SOC) were evaluated for surface (0-1 cm) samples. Particle size distribution (PSD) and clay mineralogy of in situ soil, runoff sediment, and WDC were also determined. Data indicated Fe oxides play a more significant role in clay aggregation than soil organic matter (SOM) in these high Fe systems. Higher clay amounts were recovered with dithionite extractable Fe removed (Fed) compared with SOM removal (33 +/- 3% vs 25 +/- 4%). The WDC quantities were related to SOC (r(2) = 0.65) and negatively correlated with Fed (%) and water stable aggregates (%). Particle size and mineralogy of runoff sediment and WDC mineralogy were similar to in situ soil, suggesting models depicting erosion and sediment-attached pollutant transport can be developed using in situ soil as a surrogate for sediment characterization in these soils.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was evaluated under three land use practices on sloping land of Kolombangara in Solomon Islands (5-12degreesS, 155-170degreesW). Three soil management treatments were: (1) natural forest, (2) traditional farming practice, and (3) topsoil removal. The SOC concentration was high in the surface layer of soil under natural forest and decreased sharply with depth. The SOC concentration of the 0-15 cm depth was significantly greater under natural forest (67 g kg(-1)) compared to the traditional farming (24 g kg(-1)) and topsoil removal (7 g kg(-1)) treatments. The depletion of SOC concentration in traditional farming and topsoil removal treatments decreased the mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates. In this strongly structured soil, the traditional farming treatment had no detrimental effect on water stable macroaggregates (WSA) for either of the two depths. WSAs in natural forest had significantly higher SOC concentration compared to the microaggregates. There was no difference in SOC concentration among different aggregate size fractions in the topsoil removal treatment. The traditional farming treatment based on slash-and-burn agriculture depleted the SOC pool in the top 30 cm layer by 52.2 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. The loss of SOC pool in the topsoil removal treatment was 94.8 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. Severe erosion, leading to a complete loss of topsoil as in the case of the topsoil removal treatment, has drastic adverse impacts on productivity and quality of the exposed sub-soil. Thus, there is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture now widely practiced in the Solomon Islands. In this regard, a judicious use of chemical fertilizers and biosolids may be crucial to achieving sustainable production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sediment cores from two neighbouring lakes ( Viitna Linajarv and Viitna Pikkjarv) in northern Estonia were studied to determine lake- level fluctuations during the Holocene and their impact on biogeochemical cycling. Organic matter and pollen records dated by radiocarbon and radiolead indicated a water level rise in both lakes during the early Holocene ( c. 10 000 - 8000 BP). A regression followed around 7500 BP and several transgressions occurred during the latter half of the Holocene, c. 6500 and 3000 BP. Human impact during the last centuries has caused short- term lake- level fluctuations and accelerated sediment accumulation in the lakes. The differences in water depth led to variations in sediment formation. During 10 000 - 8000 BP ( Preboreal and Boreal chronozones) mineral- rich sediments with coloured interlayers deposited in L. Linajarv. These sediments indicate intensive erosion from the catchment and oxygen- rich lake, which favoured precipitation of iron oxides and carbonates. Fluctuations in water depth, leaching of nutrients from catchment soils and climatic changes increased the trophy of L. Linajarv around 6000 BP. The subsequent accumulation of gyttja, the absence of CaCO3 and the decrease in both the C/ N ratio and phosphorus content in the sediments also indicate anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion. The similarity in the development of L. Linajarv and L. Pikkjarv and their proximity made it possible to discern the impact of water depths changes on biogeochemical cycling in lakes.

AB Scientific, political, and social interests have developed recently in the concept of using agricultural soils to sequester carbon. Studies supporting this concept indicate that soil erosion and subsequent redeposition of eroded soils in the same field may establish an ecosystem disequilibrium that promotes the buildup of carbon on agricultural landscapes. The problem is to determine the patterns of soil erosion and redeposition on the landscape and to relate these to soil carbon patterns. Radioactive (137)cesium (Cs-137) can be used to estimate soil erosion patterns and, more importantly, redeposition patterns at the field level. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between Cs-137, soil erosion, and soil carbon patterns on a small agricultural watershed. Profiles of soils from an upland area and soils in an adjacent riparian system were collected in 5 cm increments and the concentrations of Cs-137 and carbon were determined. 137Cs and carbon were uniformly mixed in the upper 15-20 cm of upland soils. Cs-137 (Bq g(-1)) and carbon (%) in the upland soils were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.66). Carbon content of the 0-20 cm layer was higher (1.4 +/- 0.3%) in areas of soil deposition than carbon content (1.1 +/- 0.3%) in areas of soil erosion as determined by the Cs-137 technique. These data suggest that. measurements of Cs-137 in the soils can be useful for understanding carbon distribution patterns in surface soil. Carbon content of the upland soils ranged from 0.5 to 1.9% with an average of 1.2 +/- 0.4% in the 0-20 cm layer while carbon below this upper tilled layer (20-30 cm) ranged from 0.2 to 1.5% with an average of 0.5 +/- 0.3%. Total carbon was 2.66 and 3.20 kg m(-2) in the upper 20 cm and upper 30 cm of the upland soils, respectively. Carbon content of the 0-20 cm layer in the riparian system ranged from 1.1 to 67.0% with an average 11.7 +/- 17.1%. Carbon content below 20 cm ranged from 1.8 to 79.3% with an average of 18.3 +/- 17.5%. Soil carbon in the upper 20 cm of the riparian profile was 10.1 and 15.0 kg m-2 in the upper 30 cm of the riparian profiles. This is an increase of organic carbon by a factor of 3.8 and 4.7 for the upper 20 cm and upper 30 cm of the riparian profiles, respectively, when compared to the upland soil profiles.

AB The effect of 2 tillage practices (zero v. conventional), fertiliser application (nitrogen, phosphorus and zinc), and pulse-cereal rotation on changes in soil mineral nitrogen, plant-available water in the soil, grain yield and protein, and key soil fertility parameters (total nitrogen, organic carbon) in the Central Highlands of Queensland were examined between 1991 and 1998. Four pasture treatments (perennial legume, perennial grass, annual legume and legume-grass mixes) were included in January 1995, following previously unsuccessful attempts to grow lucerne and annual medics. The experiment was conducted as an opportunity cropping system on an open downs soil at Gindie that is representative of a large proportion (70%) of soils in the Central Highlands. Tillage practice did not affect the amount of mineral nitrate or the plant-available water content of the soil at planting, except in 1991 and 1998 when plant-available water content was higher under conventional tillage than zero tillage. However, zero tillage improved grain yield in 2 of 4 years (wheat in 1992; sorghum in 1996), increased uptake of nitrogen in every crop and produced greater grain protein levels in both wheat crops grown than conventional tillage. There were grain responses to nitrogen + phosphorus fertilisers (wheat in 1991 and sorghum in 1997). Grain protein was increased with applications of nitrogen regardless of whether phosphorus was added in 3 of the 4 crops planted. Sowing a pulse did not significantly increase grain yields in the following crop although it did increase soil mineral nitrogen at planting. Soil nitrate remained low in control (P0N0) plots (<39 kg N/ha) when crops were planted each year but increased significantly (average 84 kg N/ha) following a long fallow of 3.5 years resulting from drought. Plant-available water content of the soil at sowing was lower where chickpeas had been grown the previous season than with wheat. Neither tillage practice nor fertiliser application affected soil organic carbon or soil total nitrogen concentrations in the topsoil. However, all pasture treatments improved soil total nitrogen compared with continuous cropping, and with the exception of annual pasture legumes, also improved soil organic carbon after only 2 seasons. Largest improvements in soil fertility (total nitrogen and organic carbon) occurred with perennial species. It was concluded that zero tillage practices can have beneficial impacts on grain yields as well as minimising environmental degradation such as soil erosion in this region. However, if soil fertility levels are to be maintained, or improved, perennial pasture rotations will need to be used as current levels of fertiliser application or rotations with pulses had no significant beneficial effect.

AB The Darling Downs and Southern Inland Burnett are important geographical subregions of the Queensland dairy industry. The system of dairy farming in these subregions is unique in Australia in that it is based on grazed annual forage crops rather than pastures. When these soils were first cultivated up to 110 years ago they were inherently fertile. However, erosion and fertility decline has reduced their productive capacity and there is a need for the adoption of farming practices that are less exploitative. In February 1997, a survey was conducted to determine dairy farmers' practices and attitudes toward management strategies that were being recommended to grain farmers in the subtropical cereal belt for sustaining the soil resource base. These strategies included greater use of ley pastures, opportunistic double- cropping, zero-till planting and higher fertiliser inputs. We found that dairy farmers were generally familiar with and understanding of the potential benefits of these approaches to their farming enterprises. However, farmers raised a number of issues that need consideration in the transfer of these practices to dairy forage production. These included concerns that an increased emphasis on pastures would result in lower and less-reliable forage production; that double- cropping is practiced more out of necessity than in the belief it is a better way to farm; that zero tillage may not be suitable on clay soils that have been trampled by cattle and that farmers rely primarily on their own observations of crop performance to determine fertiliser use. These findings have particular implications for research and extension activities conducted with dairy farmers and are also relevant to work conducted with other cropping enterprises that incorporate grazing animals in their farming program.

AB Composting reduces the available nitrogen (N) content of organic materials by immobilizing it and converting it to a slow release form. The effect of composting on phosphorus (P) is less clear. Adding compost to soil can increase water extractable soil P by direct addition, dissolution, displacing sorbed, or reducing sorption capacity for P. Organic acids can affect soil P and vary with compost maturity. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of poultry manure compost on available soil P levels. Compost of different maturities was studied to evaluate the effect of biological activity on extractable P levels in two contrasting soils, a loam and clay. Turkey litter was mixed with orchard grass hay at a 3:1 volume ratio and turned frequently, and temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen were measured regularly. Compost samples were taken at day 0 when the compost was made, and at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Compost maturitydetermined by the Dewar self-heating and oxygen uptake tests indicated that two-week old compost had greater biological activity than compost at 4 or 8 weeks. Compost samples were added to a loam or clay soil at 0.15 and 0.30-g total P kg soil(-1) and then incubated for 8 weeks. At I d and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, water-extractable and Mehlich-1 extractable P were determined. The effect of compost age was most pronounced in the loam on day 1 with water-extractable P compared to the Mehlich-1 extractable P fraction. These data suggest that water-extractable P may increase when loam soils are amended with biologically active, immature compost or when the sorption capacity of the soil is not sufficient to offset the effects of the compost addition. Because water-extractable P is implicated in runoff events, caution should be exercised in applying immature composts to critical source areas within the watershed, which are most vulnerable to P loss in surface runoff and erosion.

AB The performance and development potential of seven trees, two grasses and five turf legumes were evaluated in three highly eroded landscapes of Puerto Rico. Species development during the first year of establishment was adequate at the Corozal site, intermediate in Vega Baja and poor at the Orocovis location. Tree species Albicia procera and Leucaena leucocephala K 636 grew particularly well at Corozal and Vega Baja. At the Corozal site, grasses and turf legumes were significantly better for reducing soil erosion than trees and bare ground. Brachiaria decumbens did not allow sediment losses during a highly rainy period at this locale; it was significantly (P < 0.01) superior to all tree species, one cover legume and bare ground. Soil dissolved organic carbon (SDOC) estimates were significantly (P < 0.01) higher for ground cover species than for tree species and bare ground. Soil chemical composition of all eroded soil sites under consideration did not explain the changes in performance and development of the evaluated germplasm.

AB Agricultural carbon (C) sequestration may be one of the most cost effective ways to slow processes of global warming. Numerous environmental benefits may result from agricultural activities that sequester soil C and contribute to environmental security. As part of no-regret strategies, practices that sequester soil C help reduce soil erosion and improve water quality and are consistent with more sustainable and less chemically dependent agriculture. While we learn more about soil C storage and its central role in direct environmental benefits, we must understand the secondary environmental benefits and what they mean to production agriculture. Increasing soil C storage can increase infiltration, increase fertility and nutrient cycling, decrease wind and water erosion, minimize compaction, enhance water quality, decrease C emissions, impede pesticide movement and generally enhance environmental quality. The sum of each individual benefit adds to a total package with major significance on a global scale. Incorporating C storage in conservation planning demonstrates concern for our global resources and presents a positive role for soil C that will have a major impact on our future quality of life.

AB In different parts of the world when traditional management and planting methods are used, ploughing the soils which buries plant residue and leaves, the soil will remain naked and vulnerable to water and wind erosion process. The use of these cultivation methods in heavy sloped areas in the tropics and subtropics, undergoing heavy rainfall, has caused severe erosion and a dramatic loss of fertility in many farming areas. The constant adding organic carbon to the soil through plant cultivation, as well as keeping plant residue, preferably on the soil surface (no-tillage) are important measures to preserve and foster organic matter balance in the soil. Thus, plants used as cover crop given their high capacity to produce vegetal biomass and roots, with an important direct and indirect effects in the soil-water-plant system, play a fundamental role when they are an adequate part of orderly rotation systems with cash and food crops.

AB The cycle of organic carbon burial and exhumation moderates atmospheric chemistry and global climate over geologic timescales. The burial of organic carbon occurs predominantly at sea in association with clay-sized particles derived from the erosion of uplifted continental rocks. It follows that the history of the fine-grained particles on land may bear on the nature of the organic carbon buried. In this study, the evolution of clay-associated organic matter was followed from bedrock source to the seabed in the Eel River sedimentary system of northern California using natural abundance C-13 and C-14 tracers. Approximately half of the fine-grained organic carbon delivered to the shelf is derived from ancient sedimentary organic carbon found in the uplifted Mesozoic-Tertiary Franciscan Complex of the watershed. The short residence time of friable soils on steep hill slopes, coupled with rapid sediment accumulation rates on the shelf-slope, act to preserve the ancient organic carbon. A comparable quantity of modem organic carbon is added to particles in the watershed and on the shelf and slope. The bimodal mixture of ancient and modem C in soils and sediments may be characteristic of many short, mountainous rivers. If the Eel River chemistry is typical of such rivers, more than 40 Tg of ancient organic C may be delivered to the world's oceans each year. A flux of that magnitude would have a significant influence on marine and global C-cycles. Copyright (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Soil aggregate formation is controlled by crop and soil management, mineral, carbon and ion contents, internal drainage and associated weathering processes. Plant carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) components of soil organic matter (SOM) are key ingredients controlling the formation, function, and stability of soil aggregates. Although SOM content has been reported to be associated with aggregates of different size fractions, little is known of the soil C and N dynamics occurring within aggregates of different size fractions. Using stainless steel soil aggregate erosion (SAE) chambers, we have been able to identify multiple gradients within concentric layers from large numbers of individual soil aggregates ranging in size from 1-15 mm across. Soil tillage, cultivation, cover crops and rotations greatly modify the locations and concentrations of C, N, P and microbial communities within soil aggregates. Soil C recently deposited on aggregate surfaces is highly labile while most older and more recalcitrant C is sequestered in the central regions of aggregates. Soil aggregates associated with living roots of cover crops sequester much more N than shoot N or when plants are absent. A greater understanding of the dynamics within and at surfaces of soil aggregates will solve many mysteries of the magnificent root soil interface.

AB Interest in soil quality and health has grown with awareness that soil is vital to life on earth both in production of food and fiber and global ecosystems function and environmental stability. Agriculture needs economic soil management practices that provide sufficient food and fiber yet maintain environmental stability, ecological integrity, and the quality of essential soil, water, and air resources. Our journey towards sustainable land management starts with identification of our final destination or goals, the strategies or course by which we will get there, and the indicators that we are going the right direction. Strategies for sustainable management include conserving soil organic matter, minimizing erosion, balancing production with environmental needs, and making better use of renewable resources. In this regard, soil health is a major indicator of sustainable management. Criteria for indicators of soil health relate mainly to their utility in defining ecosystem processes and integrating physical, chemical, and biological properties; their sensitivity to management and climatic variations; and their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have inherent quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological properties within climate and ecosystem boundaries, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of sustainable management and environmental remediation. Examples are given of approaches for assessing soil health to define the economic and environmental sustainability of land management practices and to 'translate our science into practice'.

AB The brown mountain carbonate soils covering the "yadiere" (hills) in the Gissarska valley of Tadzhikistan have relatively high humus portions. The humus content in the upper layers of sedentary soils was found to range from 2.70 to 3.18 per cent. However, in eroded soils the humus content declines from 1.35-0.83 per cent to levels as low as 0.57-0.75 per cent. The decrease of humus substances in erodible soils is mainly dependent on their slope exposure. Soils on sites sloping to north revealed the highest humus content whilst soils on east and west slopes and, in particular, on south slopes were found to have the lowest humus content.
   Sprinkler irrigation applied to soils on sloping sites, following grass seeding, was found to result in swift growth and in the evolution of a natural flora what, in turn, induced intensive humus build-up. The humus content of the covering layer increased by 0.98 per cent, that in eroded soils markedly less. The increased humus content primarily leads to humic acid enrichment, this effect causing a wider SGK:SFK ratio. Following grass seeding on these soils a marked increase in the content of dissolved and R2O3-bound humic acids can be observed.

AB Activities of radionuclides in the (238)U ((230)Th, (226)Ra, (210)Pb) and (232)Th ((212)Th, (228)Th, (228)Ra) decay series were determined in sediments from an east Texas watershed and examined with isotope ratios and compared to particulate organic carbon (POC), % fines (< 63 mum) and total concentrations of Al, Fe and Mn. The objective was to elucidate the presence or absence of relationships affecting the effectiveness of these radionuclides in modeling sediment transport. Strong positive correlations were observed between radionuclides and Mn (Th) and % fines (Ra and Th). Isotope ratios effectively reduce these influences, supporting the contention that isotope ratios offset extrinsic variability in terrestrial sediments. Strong associations of (210)Pb(XS) and (226)Ra/(230)Th with POC agree with data from marine and terrestrial settings, indicating that the role of POC in isotope fractionation, transport and sequestration merits further investigation.

DE global resources; marine resources; future resources
AB Our life support systems are deteriorating, locally, globally. We have changed the atmosphere of our planet. In many regions soil erosion, soil quality, is catastrophic and with this, food security. Water quantity, quality, is a major problem in almost half the nations. Our energy systems dominated by use of oil, gas, coal are not sustainable and in many regions, the management of toxic wastes is disastrous. Our basic resources are derived from the Sun, the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and the outer 5-km of the solid Earth. We require a new effort to integrate knowledge to develop the needed technologies for the future 10 billion humans who will live with our planet. Earth sciences, Earth history, are at the foundation of such efforts.
   Observations on ocean floor processes show vast opportunities for the supply of energy and materials with minimal environmental perturbation. Today, the continental land surface is too valuable for many of these purposes. If one examines processes near the great ocean ridges at ocean hotspots, there is a vast potential for collecting almost all metals, ceramics, and of particular urgency, energy.
   Observations on the sea floor materials produced over the past decades clearly show the vast potential for mineral resources. It is interesting that the World watch Institute in their most recent "State of the World, 2003" have a special chapter "Scrapping mining dependence" and have also published a special report (paper 162, October 2002) on the Anatomy of Resource Wars. Their data on the misuse of land resources is alarming. Peter Rona has recently reviewed marine minerals for the 21st century (Episodes 25:2-12, 2002) and has written a brief version in Science (299:673-674, 2003). The data are impressive and include almost all elements use by humans. Data on the elements in manganese nodules is very impressive as also recently reported for India by Mukhopadhyay, Iyer and Ghosh in Earth Science Reviews 60:67-130, 2003. The geothermal fluids associated with the cooling of magmas have vast potential for metal transport. We have recently shown that high temperature fluids rich in carbon dioxide also contain carbon monoxide, CO, which is a wonderful transport agent for metals like gold, platinum, nickel and precipitate these on cooling. The guide to the processes is the presence of thin films of graphite, normally with sulphides. And in most places, there is evidence for the role played by diverse microorganisms. Recently, Karthikeyan and Beveridge have described how certain biofilms can precipitate gold (Environmental Microbiology 4:667-675, 2002). Fyfe (Science 273:448, 1996) has reviewed the wide range of environments where microorganisms are common, even to depths of over 4 km at temperatures of 100degreesC. We cannot understand near surface geochemistry without understanding the role of microorganisms.
   The world needs new energy technologies. The sea floor rocks have vast potential for geothermal energy. As I have shown 100 km3 of rock at 1000degreesC could provide our global energy needs. And hot geothermal fluids also contain hydrogen, the perfect mobile fuel. The literature on geothermal hydrogen is exploding but see an early review by Hawkes, Mining Engineering, June 1980, 671-675.
   We have also recently shown that with microorganisms, basalts can fix carbon dioxide with great efficiency. Why not put combustion gases underground (see Fyfe, Science, 1996).
   There is also vast potential for agricultural materials in ocean floor systems. These include: minerals with phosphorus, calcium, potassium and traces like molybdenum necessary for natural nitrogen fixation in soils. But recently there have been observations that fascinate me. The worst soils in the world in the world for food production are the mineral deficient laterites of many regions. Recent studies in Brazil on modem marine sediments from Guanabara Bay and Utuba Bay are of great interest (see Anais da Academia Brasileira. de Ciencias 73:121, 2001; 75:77, 2003). First it is of great interest that the older sediments are dominated by illite vermiculite and smectite. In addition, the trace metal content and organic content increase with long exposure to marine fluids. Such observations raise a great question: Does rather short exposure to seawater delaterize soils and could such sediments be used as fertilizer materials in many old lateritic soils? Mineral fertilizers can be of long life, low pollution and can be economic.
   Another urgent topic in our world is the management of many types of wastes. Recently, we have shown that if arsenic-polluted water is filtered through powders of FeS (pyrrhotite) the arsenic is removed to acceptable levels. But where do you put the wastes?
   And another urgent question is, where is the best place on the planet to deposit nuclear wastes? The Japanese have considered ocean trenches and the British, ocean muds where the wastes can be higly dispersed. Near shore sites with high sedimentation rates could be of interest. Marine experts must consider such problems (see Fyfe, Engineering Geology 52:159-161, 1999).
   Finally, I have a dream! When we consider situations like the Juan de Fuca ridge off the Pacific west coast, where sediments rapidly cover and insulate the very warm ridge basalts thermal gradients are very high. Could we produce an ocean resource ship, which could drill, produce geothermal energy, geothermal hydrogen, metals and return the processed fluids underground with zero pollution? Such technologies have been developed in the geothermal regions of New Zealand. Given the mass of west coast ridge hot rocks, the energy involved could supply the needs of the west coast of North America.
   As in many such examples the need is for clear, accurate, demonstration that it could work! And the economic analysis must be for decades, future generations, not just till the next election! All people should read the stimulating publication "Earth Alert, the past, present and future of our planet", published by the Geologists Association of London, 2000.

AB This paper assessed the biophysical and economic consequences of land-use change from Imperata grasslands to continuous maize cropping and tree-based farming systems in Claveria, Northern Mindanao, Philippines. The long-term productivity and sustainability of upland farms under the three land-uses (Imperata, maize and Gmelina) were determined through a bioeconomic modeling approach using Soil Changes Under Agroforestry (SCUAF) model linked to a cost-benefit spreadsheet. Changes in soil carbon and soil erosion as well as carbon sequestration potential were examined.
   Simulation results have shown that the Gmelina system appears to be superior compared with the other systems studied since it had the least cumulative soil loss and highest organic C retained in the soil-plant system. The Gmelina plantation system obtained a higher level of farm productivity, highest private financial profitability and social benefits from carbon sequestration. The social benefits of carbon sequestration for Gmelina system can strongly justify for government intervention that would encourage farmers to transform marginal Imperata areas into a productive and sustainable Gmelina plantation system.

AB A study of lipid biomarkers in predominantly laminated, organic carbon-rich sediments in Lake Albano (central Italy) has been used to reconstruct changes in the aquatic system variations and changes in the take catchment area during the Holocene. Biomarkers of aquatic organic matter such as dinosterol, isoarborinol, tetrahymanol, diplopterol, and diploptene reflect two major changes in the mixing behaviour and the biological assemblages of Lake Albano at around 6.5 and 3.8 ky BP, respectively. Biomarkers for higher land plants such as friedelin, long-chain n-alkanes, beta-amyrenone and alpha-amyrenone display different distribution patterns, indicating changes in the lake's catchment at 6.5 and 5.0 ky BP, resulting from soil erosion and changes in the local vegetation. Analogously, the recognised changes in the water column structure and biological components are coherent with previous reconstructions based on independent parameters. The new data highlight the importance of multiproxy studies to better characterize palaeoenvironmental changes that are in turn the first step towards elucidating their trigger mechanisms (i.e. climate vs. human-induced).

AB Coastal erosion over a fifty-year period, and permafrost characteristics of the shoreline associated with that erosion, were assessed at Beaufort Lagoon in northeast Alaska. Soil stratigraphy was obtained from two bank exposures on abandoned floodplain deposits and one exposure on a sand sheet deposit. All exposures had a thin (10-11 cm) fibrous peat accumulation at the surface underlain by a thin (17-23 cm) aeolian silt deposit. Below these surface layers were thick buried accumulations of discontinuous, amorphous peat clumps extending as deep as 1.5 m. Moisture contents (% vol.) for soils with segregated ice ranged from 52.7% to 84.4% in frozen soils. The volume of excess ice from segregated ice in the entire profiles ranged from 12.3% to 49.7%. Volume of wedge ice ranged from 10% to 20%. Organic carbon stores were 48-79 kg C/m(2) in the top 1 m, and 54-136 kg C/m(2) for the entire portion of the banks above water level (1.7-3.3 m high). Photogrammetric analysis of aerial photography from 1948 and 1978, and IKONOS imagery from 200 1, revealed a mean erosion rate of 0.5 m/yr for the 1948-1978 period and 0.5 m/yr for the 1978-2001 period along a 10 kin stretch of coastline. Annual organic carbon input from the eroding shorelines (above water portion) ranged from 3 7,800 to 68,000 kg C/km of shoreline for the three sites.

AB The paper summarizes results of investigations done in 1999-2000 by several authors in Wielkopolska region, (western Poland) near Turew in young midfield shelterbelts and adjacent cereal fields. It was found that the soil organic matter content, as well as microbial and faunal biomass decrease gradually from the shelterbelt toward the field centre. The annual increase of carbon was assessed and possible sources of it (wind erosion, leaf fall, input of invertebrate faeces) considered. The results suggest, that excreta contribute significantly to total carbon input. The shelterbelts influence the biomass, density and composition of many soil and above-ground invertebrate taxa and individual size of animals occurring in bordering fields.

AB In addition to field observations, mineralogical, chemical, and micromorphological analyses, and scanning electron microscope studies were conducted to reconstruct soil forming processes in a paleosol profile sequence located in an open-cast lignite mine in North Central Hungary (Visonta, pediment of the Matra Mountains). Based on these investigations, several different, sometimes contradictory processes were identified: bioturbation on various scales, shrinking-swelling, leaching, CaCO(3) and Fe-oxide precipitation, erosion, sedimentation, weathering, clay mineral transformation, clay illuviation, organic matter accumulations, reduction and oxidation, and frost action. Joint occurrence of these phenomena indicates environmental changes during the formation of the studied sequence. Many of these processes overlap and might have occurred several times. The presence of erosional surfaces makes it more difficult to establish the exact age of this complex formation. All observations suggest that sedimentation and soil formation on the Matra pediment were not continuous during the Quaternary. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Zuni farmers of western New Mexico demonstrate knowledge about soil and hydrological processes that link upland watersheds to alluvium-derived soils that have crucial cultural, ecological, and hydrological functions. To define how hillslopes contribute to productivity of soils derived from alluvium, we studied soil-vegetation-landform parameters in three headwater drainages on the Zuni Indian Reservation. Analyses along eight summit to toeslope transects show that soil properties follow parabolic and linear trends with changes driven by elevation, lithology, and vegetation in the mesa-Canyon pinyon-juniper-Gambel oak (Pinus edulis Engelm Juniperus spp Quercus gambelii Nutt.) woodlands. Total organic C, N, and P concentrations in surface horizons follow negative parabolic trends and are highest on wooded backslopes and lowest on summits and toeslopes. Inorganic N and available P concentrations and total organic to inorganic N and P ratios increase linearly from summit to toeslope. Taken together, soil, landform, and vegetation data suggest: (i) summit positions are relatively stable with immobilizing microbial environments; (ii) inorganic nutrients increase progressively down steep and erodible backslopes as inputs of forest litter are mixed with surface soil; (iii) influx of mixed sediment and organic materials from backslopes maintains concentrations of inorganic nutrients on footslopes and toeslopes. Entrenchment of drainage ways can circumvent these translocation processes. Without the influx of organic materials, footslopes and toeslopes may become nutrient-depleted as immobilization becomes the dominant microbial process. The results underscore the importance of functional connectivity between upland hillslopes and alluvial soils.

AB Excessive grazing pressure is detrimental to plant productivity and may lead to declines in soil organic matter. Soil organic matter is an important source of plant nutrients and can enhance soil aggregation, limit soil erosion, and can also increase cation exchange and water holding capacities, and is, therefore, a key regulator of grassland ecosystem processes. Changes in grassland management which reverse the process of declining productivity can potentially lead to increased soil C. Thus, rehabilitation of areas degraded by overgrazing can potentially sequester atmospheric C. We compiled data from the literature to evaluate the influence of grazing intensity on soil C. Based on data contained within these studies, we ascertained a positive linear relationship between potential C sequestration and mean annual precipitation which we extrapolated to estimate global C sequestration potential with rehabilitation of overgrazed grassland. The GLASOD and IGBP DISCover data sets were integrated to generate a map of overgrazed grassland area for each of four severity classes on each continent. Our regression model predicted losses of soil C with decreased grazing intensity in drier areas (precipitation less than 333 mm yr(-1)), but substantial sequestration in wetter areas. Most (93%) C sequestration potential occurred in areas with MAP less than 1800 mm. Universal rehabilitation of overgrazed grasslands can sequester approximately 45 Tg C yr(-1), most of which can be achieved simply by cessation of overgrazing and implementation of moderate grazing intensity. Institutional level investments by governments may be required to sequester additional C.

AB Rock weathering is the ultimate source of phosphorus (P) to the oceans, where P can be a limiting nutrient for biological production. In this paper, P weathering is examined in soil chronosequences formed in weathering profiles on the organic-rich Woodford Shale, New Albany Shale and Green River Shale. At all sites, organic P and inorganic P concentrations reveal that P weathering is far from complete, prior to erosion. Carbon (C)/P ratios decrease significantly from unweathered shale to the weathered shale at all sites, which is driven by loss of total organic C with weathering. Here we characterize organic phosphorus across a weathering profile from the Woodford Shale using solid-state CPMAS P-31 NMR spectroscopy techniques, revealing that P esters are the dominant forms of P during all stages of weathering. Certain P esters appear to be resistant to chemical weathering during the millions of years between deposition, uplift and erosion, possibly representing a significant long-term global sink for P.

AB A reduction in plant cover can lead to an increase in the erosion processes that diminish soil quality. Any rise in temperature resulting from predicted climate changes may aggravate this effect, particularly in semiarid Mediterranean areas. Bearing this in mind, the capacity of a soil to preserve organic matter becomes very important if the soil is to maintain its physical and chemical properties. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen changes were evaluated in a non-disturbed (with natural vegetation) and a disturbed (all vegetation manually clipped to ground level) pine system. Nine years after vegetation removal significant differences (p < 0.01) were found in the soil organic carbon content between plots (top 20 cm), but not in total nitrogen. In the disturbed plot 0.0232 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) of soil organic carbon were lost through erosion and 4.30 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) through mineralization. In the first 48 months after vegetation removal the soil organic carbon content fell from 40.3 to 28.0 g kg(-1). In the last 60 months of the experiment the amount of organic carbon in the soil fell from 28.0 to 27.7 g kg(-1). This result was mainly attributable to the intense oxidization, which took place during the first 60 months, of organic matter linked to the coarse soil mineral fraction. Up to the 72(nd) month the losses by erosion were a total of 532.7 g, which rose to 1284.4 g by the end of the experiment (108 months). The effect of vegetation removal in a Mediterranean semiarid area leads to a rapid decline in the amount of organic carbon stored in the soil. Such perturbation is irreversible if left to nature.

AB We review the evidence for multiple ecological states and the factors that create ecological resilience in coral reef ecosystems. There are natural differences among benthic communities along gradients of water temperature, light, nutrients, and organic matter associated with upwelling-downwelling and onshore-offshore systems. Along gradients from oligotrophy to eutrophy, plant-animal symbioses tend to decrease, and the abundance of algae and heterotrophic suspension feeders and the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon production tend to increase. Human influences such as fishing, increased organic matter and nutrients, sediments, warm water, and transportation of xenobiotics and diseases are common causes of a large number of recently reported ecological shifts. It is often the interaction of persistent and multiple synergistic disturbances that causes permanent ecological transitions, rather than the succession of individual short-term disturbances. For example, fishing can remove top-level predators, resulting in the ecological release of prey such as sea urchins and coral-eating invertebrates. When sea urchins are not common because of unsuitable habitat, recruitment limitations, and diseases, and when overfishing removes herbivorous fish, frondose brown algae can dominate. Terrigenous sediments carried onto reefs as a result of increased soil erosion largely promote the dominance of turf or articulated green algae. Elevated nutrients and organic matter can increase internal eroders of reef substratum and a mixture of filamentous algae. Local conservation actions that attempt to reduce fishing and terrestrial influences promote the high production of inorganic carbon that is necessary for reef growth. However, global climate change threatens to undermine such actions because of increased bleaching and mortality caused by warm-water anomalies, weakened coral skeletons caused by reduced aragonite availability in reef waters, and increased incidence of diseases in coral reef species. Consequently, many coral reefs, including those that are heavily managed, have experienced net losses in accumulated inorganic carbon in recent decades and appear likely to continue this trend in coming decades. Reefs urgently need to be managed with a view to strengthening their resilience to the increased frequency and intensity of these pressures. Ecological targets must include the restoration or maintenance of species diversity, keystone species, spatial heterogeneity, refugia, and connectivity. Achieving these goals will require unprecedented cooperative synergy between human organizations at all political levels, from intergovernmental to local.

AB The preservation of plant residues is important for sustainable arable cropping. Lignin is a marker for plant residues in soils. We have investigated influences of the length of cultivation on the dynamics of lignin. Composite samples were taken from the top 20 cm of soils that have been cropped for periods varying from 0 to 98 years in each of three different agro-ecosystems in the Free State Province of South Africa. Lignin-derived phenols were determined in the < 2 &mu;m (clay), 2-20 &mu;m (silt), 20-250 &mu;m (fine sand) and 250-2000 &mu;m (coarse sand) size separates. With increasing length of cultivation, the concentration of such phenols decreased to 36% of that in the grassland. The lignin contents as proportions of the total carbon did not change during cultivation, suggesting that there was no selective enrichment of lignin moieties as C was lost as a result of cultivation. The loss rate constants of lignin concentrations in particle-size fractions increased in the order clay (0.17 year(-1)) &LE; silt (0.18 year(-1)) < fine sand (0.20 year(-1)) < coarse sand (0.22 year(-1)). Increasing ratios of phenolic acids to aldehydes in bulk soil, silt and fine sand fractions with increasing length of cultivation indicated that side chains were being oxidized. The ratios in the silt fraction, however, decreased after 10-20 years. We attribute this to a loss of lignin together with silt by wind erosion, resulting in a rejuvenation of lignin compounds in the remaining silt-sized pools of C.

AB Soil organic matter is strongly related to soil type, landscape morphology, and soil and crop management practices. Therefore, long-term (15-36-years) effects of six cropland management systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in 0-30 cm depth were studied for the period of 1939-1999 at the North Appalachian Experimental Watersheds (<3 ha, Dystric Cambisol, Haplic Luvisol, and Haplic Alisol) near Coshocton, OH, USA. Six management treatments were: (1) no tillage continuous corn with NPK (NC); (2) no tillage continuous corn with NPK and manure (NTC-M); (3) no tillage corn-soybean rotation (NTR); (4) chisel tillage corn-soybean rotation (CTR); (5) moldboard tillage with corn-wheat-meadow-meadow rotation with improved practices (MTR-I); (6) moldboard tillage with corn-wheat-meadow-meadow rotation with prevalent practices (MTR-P). The SOC pool ranged from 24.5 Mg ha(-1) in the 32-years moldboard tillage corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-meadow-meadow rotation with straight row farming and annual application of fertilizer (N:P:K = 5:9:17) of 56-112 kg ha(-1) and cattle (Bos taurus) manure of 9 Mg ha(-1) as the prevalent system (MTR-P) to 65.5 Mg ha(-1) in the 36-years no tillage continuous corn with contour row farming and annual application of 170-225 kg N ha(-1) and appropriate amounts of P and K, and 6-11 Mg ha(-1) of cattle manure as the improved system (NTC-M). The difference in SOC pool among management systems ranged from 2.4 to 41 Mg ha(-1) and was greater than 25 Mg ha(-1) between NTC-M and the other five management systems. The difference in the SOC pool of NTC-M and that of no tillage continuous corn (NTC) were 16-21 Mg ha(-1) higher at the lower slope position than at the middle and upper slope positions. The effect of slope positions on SOC pools of the other management systems was significantly less (< 5 Mg ha(-1)). The effects of manure application, tillage, crop rotation, fertilizer rate, and soil and water conservation farming on SOC pool were accumulative. The NTC-M treatment with application of NPK fertilizer, lime, and cattle manure is an effective cropland management system for SOC sequestration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of soil erosion and restrictive subsurface features can adversely influence root growth and crop productivity: The effects of depth to a restrictive layer on yield and root development were determined for soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and corn (Zea mays L.) grown on Grenada silt loam (Oxyaquic Fraglossudalfs) in West Tennessee. Seven sites were selected in a cropped field where depth to the fragipan ranged from 0 to 107 cm below the soil surface. Across-the-site comparisons involving bulk density, soil color, exchangeable acidity and organic carbon indicated that at the sites that were shallow to the fragipan, profile modification had occurred as a result of soil erosion. Soils were sampled to 120 cm depths in 15 cm increments within the row and 25 and 51 cm from the row. Roots were extracted and total root lengths were determined by the line-intercept method. Greater total root lengths were observed with increasing depth to the fragipan. Crop yields decreased significantly as depth to the fragipan decreased. Soybean yields ranged from 0.5 Mg ha(-1) on the 0 cm depth site to 2.8 Mg ha(-1) on the 107 cm depth site, whereas corn yields ranged from 5.5 Mg ha(-1) on the 0 cm depth site to 10.0 Mg ha(-1) on the 107 cm depth site. Erosion was not measured directly; however, the reduced soil depth due to erosion caused an easily demonstrated reduction in root growth and yield in both corn and soybean.

AB Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks are presented for Central and Eastern Europe. The study uses the soil geographic and attribute data held in a 1:2 500 000 scale Soil and Terrain (SOTER) database, covering Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation (west of the Urals), Slovakia, and Ukraine. Means and coefficients of variation for soil organic carbon and total nitrogen are presented for each major FAO soil grouping. The mean content of organic carbon, to a depth of 1 m, ranges from 3.9 kg C m(-2) for coarse textured Arenosols to 72.9 kg C m(-2) for poorly drained Histosols. Mean carbon content for the mineral soils, excluding Arenosols, is 15.8 kg C m(-2). The top 1 m of soil holds 110 pg C (pg= 10(15) g), which corresponds to about 7% of the global stock of soil organic carbon. About 44% of this carbon pool is held in the top 0.3 in of the soil, the layer that is most prone to be changed by changes in soil use and management. About 166 million ha in Central and Eastern Europe have been degraded by compaction, erosion of topsoil, fertility decline and crusting. The achievable level of carbon sequestration for these soils, upon adoption of 'best' management practices or restorative measures, is estimated.

AB When over exploited and coupled with climatic conditions, tropical soils are subject to increased erosion and a loss of soil organic matter. Countermeasures include the incorporation of organic materials such as crop and animal residues. We studied the effect of adding crop residues and manure to soil, at five sites in Ethiopia, on carbohydrate properties, aggregate stability and the C and N distribution within water-stable aggregates. The effects of organic amendments varied between sites. The largest content of carbohydrates was obtained in the control treatment at Holeta, Ginchi (90 kg ha(-1) mustard meal), Jimma (5 t ha(-1) cow dung + 9 t ha(-1) coffee husk), Awassa (forested soil), and Sirinka (soil alley-cropped with Leuceanae). The aggregate stability of these soils was highly correlated with the OM content but not with carbohydrates. The smaller aggregates (<1.00 mm) accumulated more carbohydrates than the larger (>1.00 mm), thereby suggesting a protecting effect within the finer soil fractions. A protecting role played by humified OM components was also indicated by the C and N distribution as well as the C:N ratios which showed preferential accumulation in small rather than in large aggregates. The isotopic C-13-OC values of carbohydrate extracts were generally low, suggesting that OM was from plants with C3 photosynthetic pathways. Soil treatments with maize alone or combined with coffee husks at Jimma decreased the delta(13)Cparts per thousand values slightly, revealing that maize contributed a share of the labile OM. Despite the improvement in the soil OM content, neither the carbohydrate content nor the aggregate stability were increased to the level of the forested sites, suggesting that the additions of crop residues and manure were not alone sufficient to restore the soil physical quality.

AB Gaseous exchange between surface soil and the atmosphere is an important process in the environmental fate of many chemicals. It was hypothesized that this process is influenced by vertical transport of chemicals sorbed to soil particles. Vertical sorbed phase transport in surface soils occurs by many processes such as bioturbation, cryoturbation, and erosion into cracks formed by soil drying. The solution of the advection/ diffusion equation proposed by Jury et al. to describe organic chemical fate in a uniformly contaminated surface soil was modified to include vertical sorbed phase transport. This process was modeled using a sorbed phase diffusion coefficient, the value of which was derived from soil carbon mass balances in the literature. The effective diffusivity of the chemical in a typical soil was greater in the modified model than in the model without sorbed phase transport for compounds with log K-OW > 2 and log K-OA > 6. Within this chemical partitioning space, the rate of volatilization from the surface soil was larger in the modified model than in the original model by up to a factor of 65. The volatilization rate was insensitive to the value of the sorbed phase diffusion coefficient throughout much of this chemical partitioning space, indicating that the surface soil layer was essentially well-mixed and that the mass transfer coefficient was determined by diffusion through the atmospheric boundary layer only. When this process was included in a non-steady-state regional multimedia chemical fate model running with a generic emissions scenario to air, the predicted soil concentrations increased by upto a factor of 25,while the air concentrations decreased by as much as a factor of similar to3. Vertical sorbed phase transport in the soil thus has a major impact on predicted air and soil concentrations, the state of equilibrium, and the direction and magnitude of the chemical flux between air and soil. It is a key process influencing the environmental fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

AB A general assumption in many agroecosystem C and N turnover models is that the decomposition of added organic matter starts at the moment of residue incorporation into the soil. In fact, decomposition is already initiated on the surface of the soil. This decomposition of surface crop residues has been modelled mainly to describe the decrease in soil cover which protects the soil surface from erosive forces, but not to simulate change in surface crop residue quality and mineralisation of C and N. Therefore, we included a surface decomposition submodel in an existing mineralisation model and tested the new C and N turnover model using data from a field site study. The results show that the new model is able to describe the C and N turnover of crop residues in more detail, including the decrease of soil cover observed in the field.

ID ORGANIC-CARBON; NITROGEN; FERTILIZATION; CORN
AB Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (WF) using conventional stubble mulch tillage (CT) is the predominant production practice in the central Great Plains and has resulted in high erosion potential and decreased soil organic C (SOC) contents. This study, conducted from 1990 through 1994 on a Weld silt loam (Aridic Argiustoll) near Akron, CO, evaluated the effect of WF tillage system with varying degrees of soil disturbance [no-till (NT), reduced till (RT), CT, and bare fallow (BF)] and crop rotation [WF, NT wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow (WCF), and NT continuous corn (CC)] on winter wheat and corn yields, aboveground residue additions to the soil at harvest, surface residue amounts at planting, and SOC. Neither tillage nor crop rotation affected winter wheat yields, which averaged 2930 kg ha(-1). Corn grain yields for the CC (NT) and WCF (NT) rotations averaged 1980 and 3520 kg ha(-1), respectively. The WCF (NT) rotation returned 8870 kg ha(-1) residue to the soil in each 3-yr cycle, which is 2960 kg ha(-1) on an annualized basis. Annualized residue return in WF averaged 2520 kg ha(-1), which was 15% less than WCF (NT). Annualized corn residue returned to the soil was 3190 kg ha(-1) for the CC (NT) rotation. At wheat planting, surface crop residues varied with year, tillage, and rotation, averaging WCF (NT) (5120 kg ha(-1)) > WF (NT) (3380 kg ha-1) > WF (RT) (2140 kg ha(-1)) > WF (CT) (1420 kg ha(-1)) > WF (BF) (50 kg ha(-1)). Soil erosion potential was lessened with WCF (NT), CC (NT), and WF (NT) systems because of the large amounts of residue cover. Levels of SOC in descending order in 1994 were CC (NT) WCF (NT) WF (NT) = WF (RT) = WF (CT) > WF (BF). Although not statistically significant, the CC (NT) treatment appeared to be accumulating more SOC than any of the rotations that included a fallow period, even more rapidly than WCF (NT), which had a similar amount of annualized C addition. Reduced tillage and intensified cropping increased SOC and reduced soil erosion potential.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine if relationships between landscape position and soil properties occurred on a podzolic landscape with hummocky meso-topography, which is under intensive potato production in New Brunswick, Canada. Elevation was measured on an approximately 5 m grid spacing and used to construct a digital elevation model. Selected soil textural, morphological and chemical properties were measured on a 7 x 17 grid with 25 m spacing. Landform segmentation was used to divide sampling locations into eight landform elements based on profile and plan curvature, slope gradient and specific dispersal area. Orthic Humic Regosols and Orthic Sombric Brunisols were predominant in upper slope positions, whereas gleyed subgroups of the main soil orders were commonly found in the concave, lower slope positions. Lower, concave slope positions generally had lesser sand and coarse fragment contents, greater silt, organic carbon and Cs-137 contents, and greater depth to C horizon and to bedrock than upper, convex slope positions. In contrast, A horizon thickness, clay content, soil pH and soil test P showed little relationship to landscape position. Landform segmentation was effective in characterizing the spatial distribution of soil loss at the study site, as indicated based oil Cs-137 content, and of soil taxa. However, the resulting landform elements had generally small differences in parameters such as SOC, sand, silt and clay content, which are commonly considered important in agricultural production. The landscape examined in this study appears to be dominated by soil loss and the closely related homogenizing effects of intensive tillage for potato production. The properties that continue to show a clear relationship to landform position are largely remnant properties (e.g., depth to bedrock or to the C horizon), whose pattern reflects a stronger hydrological and/or pedological control. The results provide further evidence that human-induced changes in soil can fundamentally alter the natural pattern of soil distribution in the landscape, even over relatively short (i.e., 100 years) time scales.

AB Paleolimnological techniques were used to assess human impacts on Lake Blanca, a small (0.6 km(2)), coastal fresh waterbody in southern Uruguay, which is the drinking water source for similar to100,000 local residents. We retrieved a core that extends to about 1100 C-14 yr BP. Pb-210 ages, organic mater, CO3, total carbon, nutrients, fossil pigments and diatoms allowed us to establish limnological conditions before and after cultural impacts. Soil removal (1880-1960) and intensive cattle and sheep grazing (1943-1966) led to gully formation in the catchment. This watershed erosion resulted in increased sedimentation rates. The aquatic system appeared to be mesotrophic with dominance of epibenthic diatoms until similar to1966, at which time eutrophication intensified with forestry activities. Increases in nutrients, as well as blooms of planktonic diatoms, were observed. During the last decade, tourist/urban development as well as high drinking water demand caused a reduction in lake area. Subsequent marked increases in rainfall led to further phytoplankton blooms and macrophyte proliferation.

AB Irrational exploitation has brought about serious consequences causing severe soil erosion and loss of soil productivity in the red soil region of China. Different vegetation systems were thus established for soil conservation. Five systems - composed of eroded area (Er), bamboo (Bmb), Chinese fir (CF), citrus orchard (Ctr), and rice field (Rf)-were studied to monitor the status of phosphorus in their ecosystems. Generally, soil P was concentrated in the surface soil layer. The rank order for soil total phosphorus and microbial biomass phosphorus in the surface layer was: Rf > Ctr > Bmb > CF > Er and Bmb > CF > Ctr > Rf > Er, respectively. Among the established vegetation covers, external nutrient input had intensely contributed to the buildup of soil P status as systems receiving manure or fertilizer (Bmb, Ctr and Rf) and showed considerably higher P level in their profiles as compared with their forest counterpart (CF). The amount of total P lost from the soil by erosion depended mainly on the mass of soil eroded, mainly via particulate forms. The level of soil erosion was the highest in Er, followed by CF > Ctr > Bmb, and the amount of total P loss by soil erosion in descending order was the same: Er > CF > Ctr > Bmb. All these indicated that vegetation covers reduced soil erosion and nutrient loss significantly.

AB Soil erosion and off-site transport of nutrients are reducing soil productivity and impacting water bodies across the world. Additionally, anthropogenic activities are increasing the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) that contribute to global warming. We want to present the concept that nutrient management plans should incorporate soil organic carbon (SOC) management to reduce soil erosion, cycle macro- and micronutrients, increase nutrient use efficiency, and conserve air, soil, and water quality. Plant-derived materials are the primary source of carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM), with C being the most abundant constituent and common partner of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and sulfur (S). Manures, compost, and other organic sources can help cycle organic C and other nutrients. Organic C can contribute to forming chelate compounds that increase the availability of essential micronutrients that interchange with the root surface. Management practices that increase C inputs, help reduce erosion, and increase SOC improve soil quality factors such as cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, aggregate formation, porosity, and drainage. Carbon management and nutrient cycling should be an integral part of nutrient management plans for maintaining the sustainability of our biosphere.

AB The industrial emission of carbon (C) in China in 2000 was about I Pg yr(-1), which may surpass that of the United States (1.84 Pg C) by 2020. China's large land area, similar in size to that of the United States, comprises 124 Mha of cropland, 400 Mha of grazing land and 134 Mha of forestland. Terrestrial C pool of China comprises about 35-60 Pg in the forest and 120-186 Pg in soils. Soil degradation is a major issue affecting 145 Mha by different degradative processes, of which 126 Mha are prone to accelerated soil erosion. Total annual loss by erosion is estimated at 5.5 Pg of soil and 15.9 Tg of soil organic carbon (SOC). Erosion-induced emission of C into the atmosphere may be 32-64 Tg yr(-1). The SOC pool progressively declined from the 1930s to 1980s in soils of northern China and slightly increased in those of southern China because of change in land use. Management practices that lead to depletion of the SOC stock are cultivation of upland soils, negative nutrient balance in cropland. residue removal. and soil degradation by accelerated soil erosion and salinization and the like. Agricultural practices that enhance the SOC stock include conversion of upland to rice paddies, integrated nutrient management based on liberal use of biosolids and compost, crop rotations that return large quantities of biomass. and conservation-effective systems. Adoption of recommended management practices can increase SOC concentration in puddled soil. red soil, loess soils, and salt-affected soils. In addition, I soil restoration has a potential to sequester SOC. Total potential of soil C sequestration in China is 105-198 Tg C yr(-1) of SOC and 7-138 Tg C yr(-1) for soil inorganic carbon (SIC). The accumulative potential of soil C sequestration of I I Pg at an average rate of 224 Tg yr(-1) may be realized by 2050. Soil C sequestration potential can offset about 20 per cent of the annual industrial emissions in China. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil carbon densities and pools have been estimated for Russia. The estimate was derived from the generalized version of the soil map of the country at the scale 1:2.5 million (Fridland, 1988), which has been designated a countrywide standard. At the pre-developed stage, the soils in Russia captured about 373 Pg of organic and 75 Pg of inorganic C in the 0-2.0 m layer. Organic C is intensively accumulated in the topsoil. Inorganic C tends to concentrate in deep soils and is of non-pedogenic origin. The mass of organic matter is captured in the tundra, pre-tundra, and the northern and middle taiga of Russia. Anthropogenic impacts have led to a loss of about 5 Pg of C in the 0-1.0 m layer, which is some 2% of the total C content in Russian soils. From this amount, the topsoil of cropland has lost 2.6 Pg (20% of the initial C content in soils), including 0.4 Pg caused by erosion. The deep soil (0.3-1.0 m) of cropland has lost 1 Pg. Some 0.5 Pg of C are removed from the topsoil (7%) and 0.6 Pg by the deep soil from pastures. Forest soils have roughly lost about 0.3 Pg of C due to the decline of C input into soils caused by various disturbances. The predicted climate warming is expected to enhance the C sequestration by soil in Russia.

AB A conceptual model of soil performance in the Venezuelan Central Plains is presented, based on the relations between soil structure and active and stabilized fractions of the organic matter It shows how soil processes change with agronomic handling. Two contrasting types of fanning are considered, direct sowing Without tillage and with the presence of a vegetal cover, and conventional farming with strong mechanical procedures to break the soil and bury any kind of cover or residue. External variables (tillage and covers), state variables (organic matter fractions) and the processes involved are considered. Given the soil acidity, its low fertility with limitations for agricultural use and its ever increasing use for production of cereals, mostly maize, the changes in organic matter fractions due to tillage intensity and the location of vegetal residues are discussed. The latter aspects influence CO2 production, contributing to the greenhouse. effect, and can also intensify erosion processes and nutrient losses, aggravating problems of fertility and soil degradation. The conventional fanning process increases CO2 liberation and intensifies soil degradation, reducing organic matter Alternatively, direct sowing is conservationist; it increases active. and slow compartments which are potential sources of nutrients, improving fertility in: the medium term, microbial decomposition processes are slower, and, CO2 emissions are lower The direct sowing model resembles the virgin savanna model, both in state variables related to conservation and. in processes of loss and conservation, being an alternative that, leads to a more sustained use of savanna soils.

AB We investigated the impact of land-use changes on the soil biomass at several soil sites in Indonesia under different types of land-use (primary forest, secondary forest, coffee plantation, traditional orchard, and deforested area), located within a small geographical area with similar parent material and climatic conditions. Various parameters of soil microbial biomass (biomass C, biomass N, content of anthrone-reactive carbohydrate carbon, and soil ergosterol content) were examined. Our results suggested that the removal of the natural plant cover did not cause any appreciable decrease in the amount of microbial biomass; on the contrary it led to a short-time increase in the amount of microbial biomass which may be due to the availability of readily decomposable dead roots and higher sensitivity to the decomposition of residual litter in recently deforested soils. However, the amount of microbial biomass tended to decrease in proportion to the duration of the land history in coffee plantation soils. This may be ascribed to the effect of the loss of available substrates associated with soil erosion in the long term. Lower ergosterol contents in recently deforested areas reflected a reduction in the amount of fungal biomass which may be due to the destruction of the hyphal network by the slash and burn practice. On the other hand, the higher soil ergosterol content at the sites under bush regrowth indicated that microbial biomass was able to recover rapidly with the occurrence of a new plant cover.

AB Isotopes of Be and C were used to reconstruct loess accumulation, hillslope evolution, and agricultural modification in soils of western Iowa. While both elements are derived from additions by the atmosphere (via plants in the case of carbon), the differences in element cycling allow erosional and depositional processes to be separated from biochemical processing. Based on 10 Be, loess accumulation likely occurred simultaneously with hillslope degradation. Rates of loess accumulation declined fivefold between early stages (late Pleistocene and early Holocene) and later stages (late Holocene) of accumulation, but the absolute timing of accumulation requires independent dating methods. Based on C-14 measurements, plant inputs and decomposition are significant near the surface, but below 1-1.5 m carbon inputs are minimal and decomposition is nearly arrested. The amount of carbon below 1.5 m is constant (0.1%) and is composed of soil organic matter that was buried by loess. Agricultural modification results in a dramatic redistribution of 10 Be through soil erosion and deposition. By contrast, the redistribution of soil organic matter is masked by the rapid cycling of C through the topsoil as it continually decomposes and is replaced by plant inputs.

AB The effects of two bed widths (1 and 2 m) and four rainfed cotton-based cropping systems on soil properties, runoff and erosion were evaluated in a Vertisol (1 per cent slope; 21 g per 100 g sand, 12 g per 100 g silt, 67 g per 100 g clay) in subtropical central Queensland, Australia. The cropping systems were: early cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) sown between August and October; wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sown in May, sprayed out and followed by early cotton; wheat allowed to mature, harvested and followed by late cotton sown between October and December; and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) followed by cotton. Land preparation was by minimum tillage and traffic was restricted to the furrows between the beds. Rainfall runoff and soil erosion were monitored with water-height recorders, flumes and troughs. Soil structure was evaluated as air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil in the 0-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45 and 0.45-0-60 m depths. Soil chemical properties measured in the 0-0.15 In depth were organic carbon, pH (in 0.01 M CaCl2) electrical conductivity (EC1:5) of a 1 : 5 soil: water suspension and exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na. In comparison with 1 m beds, 2 m beds resulted in lower runoff and soil erosion, lower exchangeable Na, exchangeable sodium percentage and higher EC1:5/exchangeable Na, higher rate of soil organic matter decrease and better soil structure in the 0-0.15 m depth. Runoff and erosion were reduced, and cotton lint yields increased either by cropping systems sown early to intercept most of the seasonal rainfall or by those which produced a high level of ground cover. Soil physical and chemical properties were best, and runoff and erosion lowest with 2 m beds and cropping systems producing a high level of ground cover. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Agricultural management practices that after the soil organic matter (SOM) content are expected to cause changes in soil stability and aggregation. Animal manure is a source of organic matter (OM) that has been demonstrated to increase macroaggregate formation and stability. The objectives of this study were to determine how long term cattle manure applications to a calcareous Haploboroll clay loam (Lethbridge, AB, Canada) affected aggregate size distribution, the total C, N, and P content of aggregate size fractions, and water-stable aggregates. Beef cattle manure applied at rates >30 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) under dryland production and >60 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) to soils under irrigation resulted in fewer dry-sieved aggregates >7.1 mm and more dry-sieved aggregates between 0.47 and 1.2 mm in the 0- to 5-cm depth, compared with unamended soils. The dry-sieved aggregate fractions between 0.47 and 1.2 mm include the <0.84-mm fraction that has been associated with increased susceptibility to wind erosion in the Canadian semiarid prairies. There was more total C, N, and P in all dry-sieved aggregate fractions of soils receiving >30 Mg manure ha(-1) yr(-1) than unamended soils, and dry-sieved aggregates between 0.47 and 2.0 mm tended to have the highest C, N, and P contents. Water aggregate stability was higher in irrigated than dryland soils, but did not improve with increasing manure application rates. Dispersing agents in the cattle manure appear to have destabilized the larger soil macro aggregates.

AB In the Sahel, promising technologies for agricultural intensification include millet stover mulching and ridging. A four year on-farm experiment was set-up in order to assess the effect of various combinations of these two technologies on soil chemical and physical quality in a millet (Pennisetum glauctim (L.) R. Br.) - cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) relay intercropping system. Treatments included bare surface, ridging, a surface applied banded millet stover mulch (2 t ha(-1)) and a banded millet stover mulch (2 t ha(-1)) buried in ridges. The latter three treatments were implemented exclusively in the cowpea rows, with an annual rotation between the millet and cowpea rows. Both the bare and ridge plots experienced a rapid loss of organic carbon, acidification and the development of extensive surface crusts but no increase in bulk density or penetration resistance. In the year of application, mulching improved soil quality in the cowpea row with respect to pH, organic carbon and exchangeable K+ and Mg++ content, penetration resistance and bulk density, and it reduced the decline in exchangeable Ca++ and total N content. In the year following mulch application, a general decline in soil chemical quality was observed in the millet row, except for organic carbon content, and a positive residual effect was observed on penetration resistance and bulk density. As a rule, the effects of mulching in the year of application tended to be stronger in the ridged treatment with buried residue than in the banded surface mulch. In the year following application, this tendency was reversed. For the purpose of reducing soil degradation by nutrient mining and wind erosion, a banded surface mulch therefore appeared more effective than buried mulch.

AB Drained and cutover peatlands represent a persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Contemporary, intermediate, and long-term rates of peat oxidation were measured in an abandoned cutover peatland to estimate the mass of C lost in order to determined if the oxidation rate has changed with time since abandonment. Contemporary rates were measured six times per week at 25 locations within the peatland using a portable infrared gas analyzer and an enclosure system. Mean daily peat oxidation was 7.7 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) or 4.8 mm yr(-1). Intermediate (2-13 yr) oxidation rates were estimated using dendrochronological techniques. Over 325 birch (Betula spp.) shrubs, an invasive group of species in abandoned cutover peatlands, were removed from the peatland after measuring the distance to the existing peat surface from the collar of the trunk. Dating the birches permitted the determination of the rate of peat oxidation and erosion since the establishment of individuals. Long-term oxidation (19 yr) was estimated with over 10 000 measurements on exposed stable tree stumps. The mean intermediate and long-term oxidation rates were 6.2 +/- 2.9 mm yr(-1) and 5.7 +/- 1.1 mm yr(-1), respectively. These results suggest that peat oxidation rates remain high even after two decades of post-extraction abandonment. Since oxidation is an irreversible process, these results carry important implications for restoration work as well as for the determination of the long-term source of atmospheric CO2.

AB Carbon sequestration by soils is viewed as a process that can reduce CO2 emission and its potential impacts on global climate change. Therefore, impacts of various agricultural management practices on carbon (C) release/sequestration need to be assessed. The objective of this study was to measure C concentrations and transport in sediments lost with various tillage practices on small watersheds. Corn-soybean/rye (Zea mays L. Glycine max (L.) Merr./Secale cereale L.) rotations with no-till, chisel-plow, and paraplow were studied on small watersheds (0.55-0.79 ha). Disk tillage preceding the corn and soybean crops of a corn-soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/clover (Trifolium pratense L.) rotation was also studied. Each small watershed was instrumented with a 60 cm H-flume mounted on a concrete approach, and a Coshocton wheel for collecting a proportional sample of water and sediment. Samples of sediment deposited in the flume approach and in runoff were collected during a 15-year period and analyzed for total C concentration. Weighted averages of C in the sediment that passed through the flumes during the treatment periods did not differ significantly among tillage treatments, although no-till had the highest C (30 g kg(-1)) and disk had the lowest C (23 g kg(-1)) in the last 9 years of the study period. Weighted averages of C concentration in the flume floor sediments were slightly lower (21-23 g kg(-1)). For comparison, weighted C concentration in sediment that passed through flumes from small fertilized, pastured watersheds ranged from 52 to 72 g kg(-1). Average annual sediment loss was 532, 828, and 1152 kg ha(-1) for no-till, chisel-plow, and disk, respectively. Annual average transport of C via sediment was 13.8, 15.0, 12.7, and 24.0 kg ha(-1) for no-till, chisel-plow, paraplow, and disk, respectively. Although tillage practices may reduce C transport in sediment by lowering concentrations, a greater factor for reducing C movement is reducing sediment movement. This information will be useful to policy makers and others who need to put definitive values on land management practices in terms of C sequestration/release. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Peatlands cover approximately 14% of Scotland, although only part of this area is active (peat-forming) mire. Mires are important for the biodiversity of the specialist plant and animal communities they support. Study of mire ecosystems has revealed intimate relationships between their organic components and water, which mean that it is impossible to understand their ecology without considering hydrology. Whilst ecohydrological studies have concentrated on the internal functioning of mires, the insights gained are relevant to runoff generation in peat-covered river catchments. This paper reviews our knowledge of processes occurring in mires and relates these to wider catchment hydrology, on the basis of published information and recent research in Scotland. The influence of different types of land management is considered, and it emerges that mire is most effective in delaying storm run-off, in preventing soil erosion and in retaining inorganic nutrients when it is undrained; although there can be adverse effects on water quality under certain conditions. In the context of global warming, mire ecosystems are sensitive but at the same time robust to climate change, and thus contain archives of climatic data for the Holocene. Moreover, peatlands store significant quantities of carbon, and influence directly the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Various issues related to conservation and restoration of peatland biodiversity have been addressed constructively in recent decades, although approaches and objectives are not always consistent between sites. These are reviewed, and some outstanding issues and research needs are identified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crop residue is a valuable resource in Great Plains dryland agro-ecosystems because it aids in water conservation and soil erosion control. The objectives of our research were to (i) determine the effect of cropping intensity, climate gradient, and soil depth on levels and changes in soil C, soil N, and residue parameters after 8 yr of no-till management in dryland cropping systems and (ii) relate soil and residue parameters to soil C and N levels. Surface soil properties and residue parameters were compared in two cropping systems, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (WF) and wheat-corn (Zea mays L.) or sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.)-fallow (WCMF). The effects were examined on the summit position of a catenary sequence of soils across three environments representing an evapotranspiration (ET) gradient. Soils at the low- and medium-ET sites are classified as Argiustols, and the soil at the high-ET site is an Ustochrept. There was 3.0 Mg ha(-1) of residue in the surface 10 cm of soil compared with 2.7 Mg ha(-1) of residue on the soil surface averaged over ET gradient and cropping systems. About 90% of the residue in the soil was found within the 2.5-cm soil depth. The highest soil organic C (SOC) and soil organic N (SON) were observed in the surface 0- to 2.5-cm depth. There was a trend (P less than or equal to 0.16) for the more intense WCMF cropping system to have higher SOC and SON contents than the traditional WF system (C = 6.6 g kg(-1) for WF compared with 7.5 g kg(-1) for WCMF and N = 0.70 g kg(-1) for WF compared with 0.74 g kg(-1) for WCMF). From 1985 to 1993; gains in SOC (967 kg ha(-1)) and SON (74 kg ha(-1)) occurred in the surface 0- to 2.5- and 2.5- to 5-em depths while losses were observed in the 5- to 10-cm depth (SOC = -694 kg ha(-1); SON = 44 kg ha(-1)). Climate strongly modified these effects but did not reflect a clear ET gradient effect. The results suggest that higher levels of surface SOC and SON can be attained by increasing cropping intensity under no-till management.

AB Rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on annual grassland and coastal sage scrub hillslopes to determine the quantities of C and N removed by surface runoff in sediment and solution. Undisturbed coastal sage scrub soils have very high infiltration capacities (>140 mm h(-1)), preventing the generation of surface runoff. Trampling disturbance to the sage scrub plots dramatically reduced infiltration capacities, increasing the potential for surface runoff and associated nutrient loss. Infiltration capacities in the grassland plots (30-50 mm h(-1)) were lower than in the sage scrub plots. Loss rates of dissolved C and N in surface runoff from grasslands were 0.5 and 0.025 mg m(-1) s(-1) respectively, with organic N accounting for more than 50% of the dissolved N. Total dissolved losses with simulated rainfall were higher than losses in simulations with just surface runoff, demonstrating the importance of raindrop impact in transferring solutes into the How. Experimental data were incorporated into a numerical model of runoff and sediment transport to estimate hillslope-scale sediment-bound nutrient losses from grasslands. According to the model results, sediment-bound nutrient losses are sensitive to the density of vegetation cover and rainfall intensity. The model estimates annual losses in surface runoff of 0.2 and 0.02 g m(-1) for sediment-bound C and N, respectively. The results of this study suggest that conversion of coastal sage scrub to annual grasslands increases hill-slope nutrient losses and may affect stream water quality in the region.

AB Soil quality is a concept based on the premise that management can deteriorate, stabilize, or improve soil ecosystem functions. It is hypothesized that the degree of stratification of soil organic C and N pools with soil depth, expressed as a ratio, could indicate soil quality or soil ecosystem functioning, because surface organic matter is essential to erosion control, water infiltration, and conservation of nutrients. Stratification ratios allow a wide diversity of soils to be compared on the same assessment scale because of an internal normalization procedure that accounts for inherent soil differences. Stratification ratios of soil organic C were 1.1, 1.2 and 1.9 under conventional tillage (CT) and 3.4, 2.0 and 2.1 under no tillage (NT) in Georgia, Texas, and Alberta/British Columbia, respectively. The difference in stratification ratio between conventional and NT within an environment was inversely proportional to the standing stock of soil organic C to a depth of 15-20 cm across environments. Greater stratification of soil C and N pools with the adoption of conservation tillage under inherently low soil organic matter conditions (i.e., warmer climatic regime or coarse-textured soil) suggests that standing stock of soil organic matter alone is a poor indication of soil quality. Stratification of biologically active soil C and N pools (i.e., soil microbial biomass and potential activity) were equally or more sensitive to tillage, cropping intensity, and soil textural variables than stratification of total C and N. High stratification ratios of soil C and N pools could be good indicators of dynamic soil quality, independent of soil type and climatic regime, because ratios >2 would be uncommon under degraded conditions.

AB Soil degradation due to tillage has been reported Africa-wide. Other main causes of soil degradation are overgrazing, extensive cultivation of marginal lands, widespread clearing of vegetation for agriculture, deforestation, exploitation of unsuitable agricultural technologies, mis-management of arable lands, and frequent drought. Hence, declining soil fertility and increasing population pressure on lands are fragile bases on which to build expectations for improved crop production. This paper recognizes conservation tillage systems as one means for preventing food shortages and natural resources degradation throughout the continent. Conservation tillage has the potential for increasing soil organic matter content and enhancing soil aggregation. Conservation tillage systems can create an aggregated, fertile surface layer that is important from a soil erosion reduction perspective and thus for a sustainable agriculture in Africa. Some indigenous tillage systems in Africa can be adapted to meet objectives of conservation tillage systems. Further, recent technological developments in tillage and seeding machinery will certainly enhance the rate of farmer's acceptance and adoption of conservation tillage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The quantification of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in ecosystems is important for (a) understanding changes in ecosystem structure and function with changes in land use, (b) determining the sustainability of ecosystems, and (c) balancing the global C budget as it relates to global climate change. A meso-scale study was conducted to determine regional effects of climate change on C and N cycling within disturbed ecosystems. Objectives of the research were to quantify (a) sediment yield, (b) current C storage in vegetation and soils, and (c) soil C efflux from both abandoned and rehabilitated coal surface-mined lands in Ohio. A dynamic model was developed to simulate sediment yield, grassland production, and C and N cycling on surface-mined lands. Evaluation of plant production and soil erosion submodels with data sets from surface-mined lands in the mid-western U.S. resulted in r(2) values of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. Depending on the initial values of soil organic carbon (SOC), model simulations estimated that unvegetated surface-mined lands in Ohio yield approximately 441,325 Mg yr(-1) of sediment and emit between 2,000-20,000 Mg yr(-1) of C to the atmosphere from decomposition of SOC. While rehabilitated lands had a higher C efflux rate than barren lands, a positive C sequestration rate of 18.4 Mg km(-2) yr (-1) was estimated as a result of organic matter additions. This sequestion rate increased considerably under projected climate change scenarios, while it decreased when simulated rehabilitated grasslands were harvested for hay. Changes in land use and cover can cause surface-mined lands to be either a net sink or source for C. Successful rehabilitation of mined lands can decrease erosion and promote soil C sequestration, while at the same time providing additional lands for the management of natural resources.

AB The activity and biomass of soil microorganisms were determined in samples at 0-140 cm depth taken from an arable site, where the soil has been developed by erosion and colluvial deposition overlaying a black earth at 70-110 cm depth. The central aim was to get an insight into the breakdown of increasingly old and thus recalcitrant soil organic matter down the profile, effects on the availability of C to microorganisms and the microbial community structure. From 0 to 140 cm depth, microbial biomass C decreased by 96%, biomass N by 97%, the adenylates ATP, ADP, and AMP as well as the basal respiration rate by 89%. No ergosterol was measured at 120-140 cm depth. All soil biological properties decreased in distinct steps after 30 cm and 50 cm depth. At 30-90 cm depth, the amounts of soil organic C and microbial biomass C per hectare of the present colluvium exceeded nearly three-fold those in undisturbed aeolian loess sediments. The cation exchange significantly affected the relationships between microbial biomass C, biomass N, and the adenylates. As a consequence, none of the ratios between the soil microbial biomass properties revealed constant gradients throughout the profile. The adenylate energy charge (AEC) varied between the different soil layers insignificantly around a mean of 0.71. It was the most stable ratio down the profile showing absolutely no depth gradient, the lowest depth-to-depth variation, and also the lowest within depth variability. The other ratios between soil organic C, basal respiration, ergosterol, microbial biomass C and biomass N also did not reveal any marked changes in the microbial community structure.

AB Water erosion results in the mobilization and depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC), but studies providing direct experimental evidence of eroded C mineralization and its linkage to the global C cycle are lacking. A study was conducted to determine the mineralization of SOC in runoff from a southwestern Ohio Crosby soil (fine, mixed, mesic Aerie Ochraqualf) that had been under no-till (NT), chisel till (CT) and moldboard plow (MP) for 38 years. To simulate present and future soil erosion conditions, the 0-3 and 5-8 cm soil layers from triplicate soil blocks extracted from each tillage practice were used. Soil layers were transferred to runoff trays and simulated rainfall (30 +/- 5 mm h(-1)) was applied for 1 h. Runoff was collected at 20, 40 and 60 min following initiation of rainfall event. Carbon dioxide production was monitored for 100 days in runoff samples incubated without and with N (0.15-0.20 g NH4-N kg(-1) sediment) amendment to simulate situations where water erosion coincides with high soil mineral N availability. The data show that soil layer depth and time of runoff sampling had no significant effect on any of the parameters considered. Sediment delivery (g sediment m(-2) h(-1)) was significantly lower in the NT (17.4) than in the other tillage (CT: 48.9, MP: 34.1) practices; it was inversely related to degree of soil aggregation and sediment C content. The average of C export ranged between 0.6 and 1.1 g C m(-2) h(-1), and was highest in the CT soil. Mineralization of runoff C followed a first-order kinetics and proceeded at rates significantly higher in NT and N-amended runoff. Nearly half of the total runoff C mineralization recorded during the entire incubation occurred during the first 20 days suggesting that under field conditions, most of the erosion-induced CO, production will occur in the days immediately following rainfall events, Potentially mineralizable carbon (C-o) in runoff was significantly greater with NT (13.5 g C kg(-1) sediment) than with the other tillage practices, and was positively correlated with sediment C content (R-2 = 0.76) and cumulative C mineralized (R-2 =0.77-0.97). The data presented showed that 29-35 and 33-46% of the C exported in runoff was mineralized in 100 days without and with N amendment, respectively, These results are the first quantitative evidence that a significant fraction of the SOC released through water erosion is mineralizablc and, therefore represents an additional source of atmospheric CO2.

AB The elemental and isotopic composition of particulate and dissolved organic matter was investigated in the Piracicaba River basin, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Comparison of riverine organic matter from the Piracicaba River basin, a region where rivers and streams receive urban sewage and industrial effluents, with data reported for the pristine Amazon system revealed significant differences associated with anthropogenic impacts. One important difference was N enrichment in the particulate organic material of the Piracicaba basin rivers, due to (a) urban and industrial effluents, and (b) enhanced phytoplankton growth, which results from the combination of nutrient enrichment and damming of sections of the rivers. Radiocarbon concentrations were overall more depleted (older C-14 age) in the Piracicaba basin rivers than in the Amazon, which may reflect the importance of soil erosion in the former. Analyses of stable and radioactive carbon isotopes and lignin-derived compounds indicated that coarse particulate organic material is composed of a mixture of soil particles and degraded organic matter from C3 and C4 vascular plants. Fine particulate organic material was composed mainly of soil particles and phytoplankton cell remains, the latter especially during low water, Ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter was the most degraded fraction according to its lignin oxidation products, and showed the greatest influence of C4 plant sources.

AB Recent concerns about CO2 emissions and global warming have prompted renewed interest in using corn stover for energy production. Lack of markets, concerns about sustained soil productivity, and lack of commercial conversion technologies have spread harvest of corn residues for this purpose. This paper reviews existing literature to evaluate the major precluded the wide environmental impacts potentially associated with stover harvest from reduced tillage corn production sites. Issues of greatest concern are erosion and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, the latter both for its role in soil quality and yield and for global carbon cycle implications. About half of the literature examined concerned research in the United States, many publications described research activities conducted for decades, and major soil types in corn producing regions were well represented. Regional differences were primarily temperature and rainfall effects on stand establishment and yield, with potential feedback effects on SOC. Several research papers discussing the effects of residue harvest were found, but few field studies were found that explicitly studied the effects of corn stover harvest and most discussions acknowledge potential tradeoffs among beneficial and adverse effects. It was concluded that more information is needed on several topics to determine potential long-term effects of residue harvest, including (1) erosion and water quality, especially pesticides and nitrate, (2) rates of transformation of different forms of SOC, (3) effects on soil biota, and (4) SOC dynamics in the subsoil.

AB Management practices can influence soil C and N and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) yield. We examined the influence of tillage practices [no-till (NT), chisel plowing (CP), and moldboard plowing (MP)], cover crops [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) vs. winter weeds], and N fertilization rates (0, 90, and 180 kg N ha(-1)) on soil organic C and N, potential C and N mineralization (PCM and PNM, respectively), inorganic N contents, and tomato yield and N uptake. A 3-yr experiment was conducted on a Dothan sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliccous, thermic, Plinthic Paleudults) in central Georgia. Soil organic C and N after 3 yr were greater in NT with vetch than in CP and MP with vetch or weeds at 0- to 20-cm depth. The PCM, PNM, and inorganic N were greater in MP than in NT and CP at 7.5 to 20 cm in May 1996 but were greater in NT and CP than in MP at 0 to 7.5 cm in April 1997. At 0 to 20 cm, PNM and inorganic N were also greater with vetch than with weeds in April 1996 and 1997 and with 180 than with 0 kg N ha(-1) in May 1996 and August 1997. Tomato yield and N uptake were greater in CP and MP than in NT and with 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1) than with 0 kg N ha(1). Although NT with vetch can improve soil organic matter, CP can sustain tomato yield compared with MP, thereby reducing the potential for soil erosion. Hairy vetch can increase labile soil N pool and 90 compared with 180 kg N ha(-1) can sustain tomato yield, thereby reducing the amount of N fertilizer and potential for N leaching.

TI Behavior of Re and Os during low-temperature alteration: Results from
   Himalayan soils and altered black shales

AB Re-Os analyses were performed on five soil profiles developed on silicate lithologies in the Narayani drainage basin of the Himalayas, as well as on several altered black shales and associated alteration phases, The results indicate that all of these samples have lost large amounts of Re. This Re loss approached 100% in the black shale-derived soils, which also most probably lost substantial quantities of Os. The near constancy of Os and Re concentrations with depth indicates that this loss occurred quite early in the alteration process, rather than progressively during the course of soil development. A slight decrease in (187)Os/(188)Os was observed toward the surface of the two black shale soil profiles. possibly indicating a minor preferential mobility of radiogenic (187)Os for this lithology. In the black shale-derived saprolite and soils, the loss of Re and Os was related to the loss of organic carbon. The importance of this phase is underscored by the fact that organic material separated from a black shale sample accounted for nearly all of the Os contained in the whole rock. Analysis of alteration phases from the surface of a weathered black shale showed that Os liberated during alteration was partially reprecipitated in Fe oxides, with Os isotopic compositions very similar to that of the original rock, whereas Re was removed with the fluid phase.
   These results demonstrate the disproportionately large role that black shale weathering may play in determining the Re and Os contents of continental runoff and, thus, ultimately of seawater, but they also emphasize the possible complexity of this process. The data suggest that a large fraction of the Os contained in black shales is released during chemical alteration, which is apparently not the case for most other silicate rocks. Therefore, the potential contribution of black shales to the dissolved Os budget of runoff and river water may be even greater than that expected from the high Os concentrations of these rocks. The extent to which this Os will affect the seawater Os composition depends on how efficiently it is recaptured by secondary phases such as Fe-Mn oxides in situ or during transport. These results also underscore the high mobility of Re with respect to Os at every stage in the erosional process, thus explaining the order of magnitude increase in Re/Os ratio from the black shale source rocks to seawater.

AB Spring and summer tillage are usually followed by irrigation before planting crops in California's summer-dry Mediterranean-type climate. Tillage treatments such as rototillage or disking are known to disturb the soil structure to different extents, but little is known about how the intensity of a tillage event and subsequent irrigation affect the microbial biomass, respiration, CO2 efflux, and mineral N of agricultural soils. We carried out an experiment with a Yolo silt loam (fine-silt, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Mollic Xerofluvent) with two tilled treatments (rototillage and disked and rolled) an a nontilled control. The soil was subsequently sampled throughout a 17-d period. Nine days after tillage, all treatments were lightly sprinkler-irrigated to bring the soil water potential above similar to10 kPa. After tillage, the soil ammonium and nitrate content increased rapidly relative to the control with highest increases in the disked soil. Mineral N remained higher in the tilled treatments after irrigation. Rototillage and disking increased the CO2 efflux of the Soil within 24 h of the disturbance. The increase was higher in the disked soil, which was more than three times the CO2 efflux of the control soil at 0.25 h after tillage. This effect may be due to degassing of dissolved CO2 since microbial respiration did not increase in tilled soils. Irrigation increased the CO2 efflux of all treatments but this was most pronounced in the control soil, which had an order of magnitude increase in CO2 efflux after irrigation. An ancillary experiment carried out under similar conditions but with more frequent sampling showed that increases in CO2 efflux after irrigation were accompanied by increases in soil respiration. This study shows that different tillage implements affect CO2 efflux, nitrate accumulation, and microbial activity, and thus have different effects on soil and atmospheric environmental quality.

AB Land conversion and cultivation effects on belowground biomass and C were assessed at a fescue (Festuca altaica Trin. ssp. hallii) prairie site and an adjacent cultivated field seeded to spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Belowground biomass and soil organic C (SOC) were measured in three landform element groups (upper level and convex shoulder elements [UL], low-catchment-area footslope elements [FS], and low-elevation level and high-catchment-area footslope elements [LL]) at both sites. Upper level, FS, and LL landscape positions in the prairie had, respectively, eight, 12, and 13 times more belowground biomass in the top 60 cm of soil than their cultivated field counterparts. In the upper 1.8 in of soil, belowground biomass in the prairie grassland increased downslope (UL = 1849 +/- 306, FS = 2533 +/- 899, and LL = 3663 +/- 1248 g in 1). In the cultivated field, LL landscape positions had higher levels of belowground biomass than either UL or FS positions (UL = 228 +/- 54.5, FS = 200 +/- 47.0, and LL = 294 +/- 76.8 g m(-2)). Losses of C from below-round biomass accounted for 17.6% of total SOC losses in UL landscape positions, and 71.7% of losses in FS positions after cultivation. Lower level positions had the greatest loss of belowground plant C (-15.6 Mg ha(-1)) but overall the SOC had increased by 9.0 Mg ha(-1). In these position the loss of belowground C was offset by significantly higher SOC additions to the surface through soil redistribution. On a whole landscape basis, the C loss because of changes in belowground biomass is a large part of the C change that occurs during the transition from native prairie to arable agriculture.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) in Canadian agricultural soils plays an important role in the global cycle of C, and management can influence its fate. Although the scientific literature suggests that practicing no-till (NT) can sequester C, this is not always the case. Furthermore, there are many other factors including climate, management history, soil type and soil landscape processes that may affect the dynamics of SOC under NT. We measured the changes in SOC under NT in southern Ontario, at varying positions in the landscape in Gleyic and Orthic Luvisols at the end of a 15-year-period. Soil cores taken to depths beyond the solum, were segmented with depth, and total SOC was determined for each segment on an equivalent mass basis. When the entire soil column was considered, there was a loss of SOC in more profiles than there were gains. Furthermore, the erosion/deposition history at each landscape position appeared to influence the dynamics of SOC. In depression areas where A(p) horizons were greater than 27 cm thick due to a history of soil deposition from upslope and local hydrology, there was a loss of total SOC after 15 years of NT. While where the A(p) thickness was less than 27 cm, there were 18 profiles with SOC gains and 15 with net losses. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the change in SOC after 15 years was negatively related to the initial total SOC content and positively related to mass of clay. The results of this study suggest that landscape position and erosion/deposition history play a significant role in the ability of NT soils to sequester SOC. Interpretations of long-term SOC monitoring studies must take into account the location of samples within fields if useful information is to be gained on C dynamics in agricultural soils.

The pipes were 5-30 cm wide and 1530 cm high. Various soil physical and chemical properties were determined and checked for their suitability as piping indicators. Silt contents reached 808 g kg(-1) in the piped soil sections where bulk densities were low to medium in comparison with clay rich and denser horizons beneath. Aggregate stabilities indicated by dispersion features, percolation rates, and dispersion ratios were suitable parameters to indicate piping vulnerability. Organic carbon contents tended to be low in the piped horizons, but there was no relationship between base saturation, ESP or EC values, and piping in the investigated soils.

AB Despite the importance of arbuscular mycorrhizae to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. nutrient uptake, soil aggregation), and the increasing evidence of global warming, responses of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to climate warming are poorly understood. In a field experiment using infrared heaters, we found effects of warming on AMF after one growing season in an annual grassland, in the absence of any effects on measured root parameters (weight, length, average diameter). AMF soil hyphal length was increased by over 40% in the warmed plots, accompanied by a strong trend for AMF root colonization increase. In the following year, root weight was again not significantly changed, and AMF root colonization increased significantly in the warmed plots. Concentration of the soil protein glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AMF hyphae with importance in soil aggregation, was decreased in the warmed plots. Soil aggregate water stability, measured for five diameter size classes, was also decreased significantly. In the following year, soil aggregate weight in two size classes was decreased significantly, but the effect size was very small. These results indicate that ecosystem warming may have stimulated carbon allocation to AMF. Other factors either influenced glomalin decomposition or production, hence influencing the role of these symbionts in soil aggregation. The observed small changes in soil aggregation, if widespread among terrestrial ecosystems, could have important consequences for soil carbon storage and erosion in a warmed climate, especially if there are cumulative effects of warming.

AB Site-specific forestry requires detailed characterization of the spatial distribution of forest soil properties and the magnitude of harvesting impacts in order to prescribe appropriate management schemes. Furthermore, evaluation of the effects of timber harvesting on soil properties conducted on a landscape scale improves the interpretive value of soil survey data. Questions exist regarding the extent and spatial distribution of the effects of timber harvesting on eroded soils of the Alabama Piedmont. We evaluated the impacts of clear-cut harvesting on the temporal and spatial variability of bulk density (rho(b)), soil strength, and water content (theta(g)) at three sites in the Alabama Piedmont where timber was predominantly mature plantation stands of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Pre-harvest spatial variability of texture, surface horizon thickness, and soil organic carbon (SOC) within single soil mapping delineations was also evaluated. Soils were moderately to severely eroded and classified in fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic and Rhodic Kanhapludult and Kanhapludult families. Although significant increases (P < 0.05) in rho(b) were observed after timber harvesting for some of the trafficking class-depth interval combinations at all sites, the largest increases were observed at the moderately eroded site. Harvesting timber increased soil strength by 25.1% on the moderately eroded site, with increases occurring to a 40-cm depth in skid trails. Results suggested the degree of harvesting impacts were erosion phase dependent, with greater impacts on moderately versus severely eroded soils. Geostatistical analyses indicated that pre-harvest % clay and surface thickness were more highly spatially correlated than pre-harvest SOC, which may be related to erosion processes. Analyses also suggested harvesting slightly increased the overall spatial variablity of rho(b), soil strength, and theta(g). These results suggest that the establishment of site-specific forest tillage zones to ameliorate compaction may be impractical to implement because of the increases in spatial variability of these properties.

AB Investigations were conducted on both the annual patterns of earthworm casting activity and the annual variations in soil and phosphorus (P) transfers by water runoff, under a temperate maize crop, to determine whether there is any time synchronism over the year between these processes that could increase risk of soil erosion. Cast dynamics were measured at 15-day intervals for 1 year. Phosphorus forms were determined in runoff waters and the sediments collected were analyzed for nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and P contents. As long as there was no crust at the soil surface, no runoff was observed. Once the sealing crust formed, the soil erosion began. After the rainstorm events in August, soil erosion already reached 70% of the total soil loss that occurred over the crop year. A total of 140 g m(-2) year(-1) of sediment was lost by the end of the year. A time synchronization was observed between tillage practices and highest cast productions over the year, which were then interrupted for up to 5 weeks after both ploughing and crop harvest. In particular, the absence of anecic casts onto the soil till September underline that Lumbricus terrestris was most affected by ploughing. The likelihood that earthworm casts contributed to soil erosion was enforced by the correlation between the timing of cast disappearance and the increase in sediment transfers for rainstorm events observed in summer, as well as for long rainy period in fall/winter. However, we could not outline a systematic correlation over the year but just for defined periods. Particulate soil erosion and P amounts in runoff waters decreased (55-2 g m(-2) and 19-5 mg of P losses m(-2), respectively) through the crop year. However, the content of organic matter in sediment increased (2.54-5.16%) compared to the initial soil (1.8%), as well as the P concentration (1.1-1.6 mg g(-1)). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A 4000-yr sediment core record from Lake Salpeten, Guatemala, provides evidence for Maya-induced forest clearance and consequent soil erosion between similar to1700 cal yr B.C. and 850 cal yr A.D. Radiocarbon ages of wood, seeds, and charcoal support an age-depth model with average errors of +/-110 cal yr. Relatively low carbonate delta(18)O values between 1300 and 400 cal yr B.C. coincide with pollen evidence for forest loss, consistent with increased surface and groundwater flow to the lake. Minimum,delta(18)O values between 400 cal yr B.C. and 150 cal yr A.D. suggest a high lake level, as do C-14-dated aquatic gastropods as much as 7.5 m above the present lake stage. High lake levels resulted from reduced evaporation-to-precipitation ratios, increased hydrologic input caused by anthropogenic deforestation, or both. The Preclassic abandonment (150 A.D.) and Early Classic/Late Classic boundary (550 A.D.) are marked by relatively high delta(18)O values indicating reduced lake levels. Oxygen isotope composition increased further coincident with the Terminal Classic Maya demographic decline between 800 and 900 A.D. This period of high delta(18)O may have been caused by the greater aridity that has been documented in northern Yucatan lakes or by decreased hydrologic input to the lake as a consequence of forest recovery. Reduced soil erosion after 850 cal yr A.D. coincided with the Terminal Classic Maya demographic decline and permitted forest recovery and resumption of organic sedimentation.

AB Continuous cultivation of soils of the semiarid tropics has led to significant land degradation. Soil erosion and nutrient loss caused by high runoff volumes have reduced crop yields and contributed to offsite damage. We compared a number of soil management practices (tillage, mulch and perennial/annual rotational based systems) for their potential to improve crop production and land resource protection in an Alfisol of the semiarid tropics of India. Runoff and soil erosion were monitored and surface soil and sediment were analysed for nitrogen and carbon to determine enrichment ratios. Amelioration of soils with organic additions (farmyard manure, rice straw) or rotating perennial pasture with annual crops increased soil carbon and nitrogen contents and reduced runoff, soil erosion and nutrient loss. Soil erosion totalled less than 7 t ha(-1), but enrichment ratios were often greater than 2 resulting in up to 27 kg N ha(-1) and 178 kg C ha(-1) being lost in sediment. Up to an extra 250 mm of water per year infiltrated the soil with organic additions and was available for crop water use or percolation to groundwater. The results show that there are good opportunities for reducing degradation and increasing productivity on farms.

AB An index to benchmark pesticide mobility relevant to surface water runoff and soil erosion (surface water mobility index, or SWMI) was derived based on two key environmental fate parameters: degradation half-life and organic carbon-normalized soil/water sorption coefficient (K-proportional to). Values assigned with the index of each individual compound correlate well with the concentration trend of 13 pesticides monitored in six Lake Erie, USA, tributaries from 1983 to 1991. Regression using a power function of SWMI tits concentration data well at various percentiles in the database for each tributary and all six tributaries combined, with r(2) ranging from 0,71 to 0.94 for the concentrations at the 95th percentile. Good agreement was also obtained between SWMI and the Time-weighted annual mean concentrations (r(2) = 0.67-0.87). Although concentrations at or near peaks tend to be driven by rare hydrological events (intense precipitation immediately after application), SWMI explains the peak concentration data generally well (r(2) = 0.53-0.86). The SWMI-concentration relationship was further evaluated with two other pesticide monitoring databases: the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment Program White River Study Unit (1991-1996) at Hazelton, Indiana, USA, and the Syngenta (previously Novartis) Voluntary Monitoring Program with Community Water Systems at the Higginsville City Lake, Missouri, USA (1995-1997). The ability of the proposed SWMI to discriminate pesticide runoff mobility and its correlation with surface water monitoring data can be significant in the development of screening methodologies and data-based models for government agencies and/or practitioners in general facing increasing pressure to assess pesticide occurrence in aquatic environments.

AB The first and possibly only major rise of atmospheric oxygen, from p(O2) less than or equal to 0.1% PAL (the present atmospheric level) to p(O2) greater than or equal to 10% PAL, appears to have occurred sometime before 2 Ga ago, although the exact time of and the cause(s) for the rise have been hotly debated. Equally important questions on the atmospheric oxygen concern its stability, especially the mechanisms regulating the atmospheric p(O2) level and the causes and magnitude of p(O2) variations since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen. Previous efforts to model the p(O2) variation during the Phanerozoic time have typically relied on secondary information, such as the carbon an sulfur isotopic records of sedimentary rocks, and on simple dynamics of the geochemical cycles of O, C, S, and P based on box-type models. As a result, many kinetic questions about the variation and stability of atmospheric oxygen could not have been answered. Here we quantitatively evaluate the dynamics and stability of atmospheric O-2 and CO2, using recent experimental data, field observations, and a new model for the C-O coupled geochemical cycles. We examine the change with time in the fluxes of various compounds (O-2, CO2, phosphate, organic C, carbonate C, C-bearing reduced volcanic gases, and C-free reduced volcanic gases) among the various reservoirs (atmosphere, soil, surface ocean, deep ocean, the lower crust and mantle, and upper crust) under a variety of scenarios. Our model does not assume steady-state fluxes for any of the reservoirs. Rather, the model incorporates the kinetic experimental data on oxidation of coal, a proxy for kerogen, the dynamics of soil formation and erosion, the kinetics of decomposition of organic matter in the Oceans by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, the equilibrium ocean-atmosphere carbonate model, the observed relationships among the organic burial flux, dissolved O-2 content of deep ocean, and sedimentation rates, and the three-box model ocean. The important parameters that strongly influence the dynamics of atmospheric O-2,O- are found to be (a) the total area of soil formation on Earth; (b) the average soil depth; (c) the average rate of physical erosion of soils, which is linked to the average rate of accumulation of elastic sediments in the oceans; (d) the composition and flux of volcanic gas; and (e) the level of atmospheric CO2. We develop kinetic equations linking these parameters to the production and consumption fluxes of atmospheric oxygen and also to stable p(O2) values. Considering the likely ranges of variations in these parameters in geologic history, we suggest that the atmospheric p(O2) level is likely to have stayed within a very narrow range of 0.6-2 PAL and that the entire ocean, except for local euxinic basins, is likely to have been basically oxygenated since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen more than 2 Ga ago.

AB Thick laminar calcrete profiles are common on the surface of the eastern Canary Islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. This paper reports the study of one profile froth Lanzarote (Macher profile) and one from Fuerteventura (Tefia profile). These profiles are about 2 m thick. The Macher profile is developed on basaltic host rocks and consists of two main horizons: a lower horizon in which white veins of laminated micrite penetrate cracks and an upper laminar horizon. The Tefia profile is cumulative and consists, from base to top of massive, laminar, and massive and laminar-brecciated horizons. Highlighted in the study of these profiles are the presence of ooids, the complex structure of the laminar horizons, and the occurrence of fossil bee nests (Celliforma). Ooids consist of a nucleus of clay, micrite and etched grains coated with envelopes of micrite and clay (mainly palygorskite). Organic films favoured both the precipitation of carbonate and the adhesion of clays when the ooids formed in the soil. The laminar horizons consist of a centimetre-scale alternation of massive micrite with varied amounts of ooids and detrital grains with laminated micrite. This alternation indicates the small-scale periods of sedimentation, erosion and soil formation in the upper part of a relatively stable surface. These small-scale alternations may reflect climatic vegetation changes in which and periods are represented by micrite with ooids while laminated micrite reflects a better-developed vegetation of the wet periods. Celliforma occur as ovoid larval cells with more or less rounded bases and a flat top. The cells are about 3 cm long and 1.5 cm in diameter. Their wall is about 5 mm thick, and is commonly laminated. Celliforma is interpreted as fossil nests of solitary bees. Their presence in the laminar horizon is evidence for the existence of a vegetation cover containing angiosperms.

AB The depth distribution of (137)Cs (cesium-137) and its relationship with organic carbon and different particle size fractions in Haplic-Udic Ferrosols in Yujiang, Southern China, are described in this paper. Compared with other sites, the lower (137)Cs inventories associated with uncultivated soils on or close to the crests indicate the relatively low (137)Cs in situ retention ability of the soil. Therefore, the use of (137)Cs techniques in erosion studies on uncultivated Haplic-Udic Ferrosols may create some significant difficulties and limitations, including identifying the suitable (137)Cs reference site and its validity on and near the crests. The impact of the soil erosion process to a depth of more than 4 to 6 cm on the sloping dry farmland and dry terrace farmland indicates that the widely accepted assumption of uniform (137)Cs depth distribution within the plough layer may not apply in these soils, although it does basically hold true for the paddy terrace field, in the area dominated by Haplic-Udic Ferrosols. For uncultivated Haplic-Udic Ferrosols, the organic matter may not control the downward migration of (137)Cs because no significant relationship was found between the depth distribution of (137)Cs and that of organic matter. It was also demonstrated that the (137)Cs fallout is associated mainly with the clay fraction, whereas the organic matter is associated mainly with the silt fraction. For Haplic-Udic Ferrosols, the water-induced erosion removes preferentially the clay associated with the relatively high concentration of (137)Cs and low content of organic matter.

AB No-tillage crop production has become an accepted practice throughout the U.S. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change has prompted great interest in conservation tillage as a management strategy to help sequester CO(2) from the atmosphere into soil organic matter. Numerous reports published in recent years indicate a large variation in the amount of potential soil organic carbon (SOC) storage with no tillage (NT) compared with conventional tillage (CT). Environmental controls (i.e., macroclimatic variables of temperature and precipitation) may limit the potential of NT to store SOC. We synthesized available data on SOC storage with NT compared with CT from published reports representing 111 comparisons from 39 locations in 19 states and provinces across the U.S. and Canada. These sites provided a climatic continuum of mean annual temperature and precipitation, which was used to identify potential SOC storage limitations with NT. Soil organic C storage potential under NT was greatest (similar to0.050 kg (.) m(-2) (.) yr(-1)) in subhumid regions of North America with mean annual precipitation-to-potential evapotranspiration ratios of 1,1 to 1.4 mm (.) mm(-1). Although NT is important for water conservation, aggregation, and protection of the soil surface from wind and water erosion in all climates, potential SOC storage with NT compared with CT was lowest in cold and dry climates, perhaps due to prevailing cropping systems that relied on low-intensity cropping, which limited C fixation. Published data indicate that increasing cropping intensity to utilize a greater fraction of available water in cold and dry climates can increase potential SOC storage with NT. These analyses indicate greatest potential SOC storage with NT would be most likely in the relatively mild climatic regions rather than extreme environments.

AB A model of optimal residue management is presented to illustrate the economic tradeoffs associated with residue management adoption. In general, the benefits of residue management are not realized in the present, but in the future, through maintenance of nutrient stocks, soil profile depth, and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. However, these future benefits come at a price, realized in the present, of residue management. A dynamic model of optimal residue and fertility management, which values future stocks of nutrients, soil depth, and SOC, is used to arbitrage the intertemporal tradeoff of benefits for costs. SOC is treated as an input in corn production, with minimal substitution possibilities with soil depth and soil nutrients; 0, 5, and 10% yield effects from increased SOC are alternatively modeled. Results indicate that without a yield effect, annual rates of SOC buildup do not exceed 0.2 tons per acre in SOC, although a 10% yield effect would nearly double the rate of SOC buildup.

AB The differences in soil properties and crop yield on slopes of varying steepness in intensively cropped paddocks with red ferrosols (Humic Eutrodox), which had evidence of erosion over many years, were determined at 5 sites in north-west Tasmania. We found that soils on the steeper slopes, which have had greater soil loss, had significantly lower topsoil carbon concentrations than soils on flatter slopes. We found that significant redistribution of soil had occurred on the sites in this study. Areas with concave slope positions had over-thickened topsoils. However, the effect of erosion on the topsoil thickness of eroded slope positions was masked by the uniform depth of cultivation across paddocks. Penetration resistance increased gradually with depth on all transects, indicating no compacted layers or plough pans on these intensively cropped sites. Soil physical properties did not significantly change from non-eroded, level areas to steep, eroded parts of the paddocks, even although considerable soil loss had occurred from the steep slopes. We attribute this to the gradational nature of these red ferrosols, which characteristically have strongly structured subsoils. Crop yield was significantly correlated with slope but was not significantly different on land up to 18% slope. We anticipate that continued erosion at current rates on this less steep land will inevitably reduce crop yields. We found a significant correlation between organic carbon, total exchangeable bases, extractable K, and crop yield, but no correlation between available water content and crop yield. We conclude that soil organic matter contributes to productivity through its effect on nutrient concentrations. Total exchangeable bases appeared to provide the best and simplest explanatory model to predict crop yield. We propose a set of 4 tests for future assessment of soil condition on these red ferrosols.

AB Planting poplars is an effective technology for controlling hill soil erosion in New Zealand pastureland. However, the effects of widely spaced poplars on soil properties are not documented. Soil was sampled from 3 soil depths (0-75, 75-150, and 150-300 mm) in poplar pasture (PP) and adjacent open pasture (OP) systems. Four sites were examined, 3 unreplicated sites with mature poplars (>29 years, 37-40 stems/ha) and a replicated experiment with immature poplars (5 years, 50-100 stems/ha). Pastures at all sites were dominated by low fertility species and were grazed by sheep and cattle. Pasture species were used in a glasshouse experiment to assess the production potential of the topsoil media (0-20 mm) from the PP and OP soils, and the OP topsoil amended with 5% poplar leaf litter.
   Soil pH was higher (0.5-1.2 units) in the PP than the OP at all depths, as were exchangeable cations. After 2 months incubation, OP topsoil amended with 5% leaf litter had higher soil pH than the PP or the OP topsoil. Organic C, total N, P or S, and plant-available P or S were similar in the PP and OP soils, or lower in the PP soil. Soil hydraulic characteristics, macroporosity, water aggregate stability, and bulk density were also similar in the PP and OP areas. The differences in the earthworm numbers and mass between the PP and OP areas were inconsistent. Pasture grown in the PP topsoil produced more over 11 months than treatments containing OP topsoil.
   In addition to increasing the stability and, hence, sustainability of hill soils at risk from erosion, poplar trees enhanced several other key attributes of the soil. The study suggested that poplars have a restoration role by accelerating soil development following the loss of topsoil from an erosion event.

AB This paper summarizes a six-year study of the Nsimi Small Experimental Watershed (SEW), considered as a model Cor the South Cameroon humid tropical ecosystem. When this small watershed was set up, no similar survey of input/output hydrobiogeochemical fluxes in granitoid rocks in stable cratonic environment was available, to our knowledge, on any site close to the Equator. Moreover, this is the first attempt, world-wide, to combine different approaches in hydrology, (bio)geochemistry, mineralogy, crystallography, microbiology, geophysics and pedology. Research is based on (1) regular hydrobiogeochemical surveys in various water reservoirs of the SEW ecosystem (atmospheric deposits, groundwater and stream), (2) surveys related either to the organisation and composition of different reservoirs in the superficial layers (basement rocks, saprolite, soils) or to various hydrological, biological and surveys aim at (1) finding the main parameters involved in the chemical and physical, geochemical processes. These sui erosion processes of the humid tropical ecosystem, (2) understanding the source of a particular chemical composition in groundwater and rivers, (3) documenting accurately the different exportation processes of chemical elements in water and soil (4) investigating the possible relation between the biodegradation of soil organic matter and the leaching of metals (especially iron) and (5) comparing the long and short term weathering rates using mass balance calculations. An other important objective of this study is to provide a new scientific and engineering database for the future development of South Cameroon, which is still nowadays a relatively preserved ecosystem.
   One of the major results is the essential role played by the biological cycle (vegetation and soil organic matter) in the fractionation, exportation or storage of the chemical elements in humid tropical environments. Moreover we are able to propose a model of the current erosion for this SEW from the database obtained on (1) the mineralogy of the basement rocks and the soil layers, (2) the geochemistry of the soluble and colloidal phases of waters and (3) the hydrology within the different reservoirs of the hydrosystem. This model has been confirmed and extended on a regional scale (Nyong river basin). It emphasized the behaviour of the main elements of the tropical soil layers (Fe, Al, Si) the nutrients (C, Ca, Mg, K, Sr) and specific tracers of the weathering processes either with strong mobility (Cl, Na) or on the contrary with an extremely low mobility (Zr, Th, REEs).
   On the SEW scale, a strong geochemical contrast occurs between the different groundwater zones flooding (1) the hill slope lateritic profiles, (22) the weathering front (interface between the saprolite and the basement rocks), and (3) the swampy zone in which the Mengong brook flows. High DOC contents (15 mg/L) but also high Fe, Th, Al, Zr contents characterize the swampy zone waters. Na and Si have mainly a deep origin (exfiltration), Al, Th, Zr and REEs are strongly linked with colloidal organic matter located in the upper horizons of the swamp. Fe has a much more complex behaviour due to its change of redox state which can be independent of organic matter complexation. Concerning the major base cations, their origin can be constrained by the biological cycle (storage or leaching). K is typically influenced by the biological cycle. During the floods, Cl has the same behaviour as K : it is one of the most striking points of this study, However, the Cl annual budget is balanced.
   These characteristics can be understood as the consequence of the weathering of the minerals present in the saprolite (kaolinite, goethite, zircon, Th-oxide). This chemical weathering allows the leaching of base cations and also Al and Fe. It has been demonstrated that the microbial populations of the swampy zone can play an important role in the mobilization of transition metals (e.g. Fe). This study point out the role of humic acids in the transport and the weathering budget of elements usually considered as immobile in the superficial cycle (e.g. Al, Th, Zr, Fe).
   It must be mentioned that worldwide the SEW and even the Nyong network waters are among the least concentrated river waters. It means that even if the organic matter plays an important role in the mobilization and transport of some elements in the swampy zone, its action is limited in term of major cation fluxes on the SEW scale. The reason invoked is that the cation fluxes are directly linked to the pedological history and the geomorphology of the watershed. The presence of thick soil layers composed of saprolite and latosol on the hillsides and of hydromorphic soils in the swampy zone with constant mineralogy lead to isolating the bedrock. The long residence time of water close to the weathering front plays a major role in preserving the parent rock from the hydro-chemical outputs. Moreover, the topsoil layers are stabilized by the vegetation cover, which limits mechanical erosion. This should be taken into account for the carbon mass balance calculation because of the wide areas on stable shields concerned by the humid tropical ecosystems. Moreover, comparison between long and short-term weathering allows us to suggest that paleo-climatic conditions did not change since the Miocene (6-20 Ma) in this part of the world.

AB Twenty-one benchmark soils of the United States, including surface and subsurface horizons and satellites, from the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) were analyzed for phosphorus (P), using methods that include total (TP), water-soluble (WP), Bray 1 (BP), Mehlich No. 3 (MP), Olsen (OLP), New Zealand P Retention (NZP), organic (OP), anion exchange resin (AEP), and acid oxalate (P-o). Objectives of this study were to determine relationships among soil P test values and other soil properties. Knowledge and understanding of these relationships are important to researchers when evaluating soil P data sets for use in predictive models for agronomic, soil genesis, or environmental purposes. Important relationships that were developed, using simple or multiple linear regression models, among P methods and other soil properties, e.g., organic carbon (OC), total N (TN), dithionite-citrate extractable iron and aluminum (Fe-d, Al-d), and clay are as follows:
   TP (mg/kg) = 229.02 + 27.76 Al-d (g/kg) + 27.44 OC (g/kg)
   + 4.14 Fe-d (g/kg), r(2) = 0.89,
   p < 0.01, n = 263 (all soils)
   OP (mg/kg) = 114.07 + 38.07 TN (g/kg) - 14.74 pH
   + 6.94 OC (g/kg), r(2) = 0.80,
   p < 0.01, n = 262 (all soils)
   BP (mg/kg) = -1.82 + 1.11 MP (mg/kg), r(2) = 0.96,
   p < 0.01, n = 268 (all soils)
   P-o (mg/kg) = 16.02 - 24.27 Al-o (g/kg) + 25.59 Fe-o (g/kg)
   + 19.33 OC (g/kg)r(2) = 0.79,
   p < 0.01, n = 203 (non-calcareous)
   NZP (%) = 16.92 + 1.37 Al-d (g/kg) + 0.28 clay (%), r(2) = 0.91,

AB Soil erosion from agricultural lands causes loss of soil productivity, as well as environmental problems down stream due to sediment and contaminants sorbed on dispersed colloids. In order to estimate the potential effects of erosion and to describe the behavior of various inorganic and organic contaminants in agro-ecosystems, quantitative characterization of soil colloid dispersion is essential. The effect of long-term tillage management (conventional-tillage and no-tillage) on mineralogical and organic carbon content in both field- and laboratory-generated water dispersible particles (WDP) were studied. Field-WDP were collected during rainfall simulation. Laboratory-WDP were obtained by shaking soil for 16 hours (soil to water ratio of 1: 10). Results demonstrate that laboratory- and field-WDP differ in organic carbon content, particle size distribution, and mineralogical concentrations, and are influenced by soil management. Soils under no-tillage produced much larger amounts of laboratory-WDP and smaller amounts of field-WDP than the soils under conventional-tillage. Field-WDP from both no-tillage and conventional-tillage fields were dominated by silt-sized particles, while laboratory-WDP dominated in the clay-sized fraction. Both organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon concentration in field-WDP runoff decreased with time during simulated rainfall events. The laboratory procedure used here for generating water-dispersible particles may not be suitable for studying runoff sediments in the field.

AB The USA has about 336 Mha of grazing lands of which rangelands account for 48%. Changes in rangeland soil C can occur in response to a wide range of management and environmental factors. Grazing, fire, arid fertilization have been shown to affect soil C storage in rangelands, as has converting marginal croplands into grasslands. Carbon losses due to soil erosion can influence soil C storage on rangelands both by reducing soil productivity in source areas and potentially increasing it in depositional areas, and by redistributing the C to areas where soil organic matter mineralization rates are different. Proper grazing management has been estimated to increase soil C storage on US rangelands from 0.1 to 0.3 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1) and new grasslands have been shown to store as much as 0.6 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Grazing lands are estimated to contain 10-30% of the world's soil organic carbon. Given the size of the C pool in grazing lands we need to better understand the current and potential effects of management on soil C storage. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils is controlled by the balance of added organic residues and microbial oxidation of both residues and native organic matter (OM) as moderated by management and tillage. The PC-based model CQESTR predicts decomposition of residues, organic amendments and soil OM, based on cropping practices. CQESTR uses RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) crop rotation and management practice, crop production, and operation databases. These data are supplemented with residue nitrogen and soil OM, bulk density, and layer thickness. CQESTR was calibrated with soil carbon data from 70-year-long experiments at the Research Center at Pendleton, OR. The calibrated model provides estimates with a 95% confidence interval of 0.33% OM. Validation at 11 independent sites resulted in a matching of observed with calculated OM with a 95% confidence interval of 0.55% OM. A 12th site, with a history of severe erosion, provided a poor match. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recent modeling studies indicate that soil erosion and terrestrial sedimentation may establish ecosystem disequilibria that promote carbon (C) sequestration within the biosphere. Movement of upland eroded soil into wetland systems with high net primary productivity may represent the greatest increase in storage capacity potential for C sequestration. The capacity of wetland systems to capture sediments and build up areas of deposition has been documented as well as the ability of these ecosystems to store substantial amounts of C. The purpose of our work was to assess rates of sediment deposition and C storage in a wetland site adjacent to a small first-order stream that drains an agricultural area. The soils of the wetland site consist of a histosol buried by sediments from the agricultural area. Samples of deposited sediments in the riparian zone were collected in 5 cm increments and the concentration of Cs-137 was used to determine the 1964 and 1954 deposition layers. Agricultural activity in the watershed has caused increased sediment deposition to the wetland. The recent upland sediment is highly enriched in organic matter indicating that large amounts of organic C have been sequestered within this zone of sediment deposition. Rates of sequestration are much higher than rates that have occurred over the pre-modern history of the wetland. These data indicate the increased sedimentation rates in the wetland ecosystem are associated with increased C sequestration rates. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Berni-isolated (0.5 ha) plots have been used since 1995 to quantify changes in soil and water quality with conversion from agricultural to bioenergy crops. Soil quality improvements, including increases in soil carbon storage, have occurred on sites planted to woody or herbaceous species, and no-till corn compared with tilled corn or cotton. Initial increases in soil carbon occurred within the upper 10 cm of the soil profile. Soil carbon on plantings of switchgrass, no-till corn, and sweetgum with a cover crop between the rows increased over the first 3 years. Soil carbon decreased by 6% on the sweetgum plantings without a cover crop and remained lower through the fifth growing season. Overall, the greatest increases in belowground carbon storage have occurred primarily within the upper 40 cm. Former land use, growth characteristics, management practices, and soil characteristics appear to be the primary factors determining the timing, depth, and extent of changes in soil carbon storage for bioenergy and no-till crops.

AB Data on magnetic susceptibility (MS) and the contents of spherical magnetic particles (SMPs), magnetic minerals, organic carbon, and particle-size fractions in cultivated and forested varieties of soddy-podzolic and soddy soils forming toposequences on hill slopes are analyzed. The method involving a technogenic magnetic tracer is suggested for a quantitative assessment of soil erosion and aggradation processes and the volumes of transported soil material. This method if based on the estimation of the distribution patterns of SMPs in the soils. The prospects for its application in soil erosion studies are discussed.

ID PATTERNS
AB The method of a technogenic magnetic tracer has been applied to assess the rates of soil erosion in the area of ancient (1000 BP) Indian mounds on the Mississippi River terrace with predominant vertic meadow soils (Vertic Haplaquolls). The content and distribution patterns of fly ash (technogenic magnetic spherules) in the soil profiles and the magnitudes of magnetic susceptibility have been analyzed together with data on the topsoil thickness and the organic carbon content. All studied soils contain from 30 to 150 g/m(2) of magnetic Win spherules with sizes varying from 1 to 50 mum. From 90 to 99% of these spherules are concentrated in the uppermost 5 cm of the soil profile. The content of fly ash in forested soils is two to four times higher than that in meadow soils. Eroded soils of the mounds are characterized by a lower content of the spherules and a smaller depth of their penetration into the soil profile in comparison with noneroded soils. The average rate of erosion for unplowed mounds is estimated at several hundred g/m(2) per year.

AB Organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) of fine (<50 mum) size fractions of deep-sea sediments from the central North Atlantic were employed to identify changes in sources of organic matter over the past 50 ka BP. Ambient glacial sediments are characterised by values that reflect mixtures of marine and terrestrial inputs (averages +/- 1sigma: OC/TN = 7.6 +/- 0.8; delta(13)C = -22.8 +/- 1.0parts per thousand; delta(15)N = 5.5 +/- 0.6parts per thousand). delta(13)C, OC, and TN concentrations shift to higher values during the Holocene, indicating a gradual decrease of fine terrigenous supply to the North Atlantic. The unchanged delta(15)N record between last glacial and Holocene stages indicates that the central North Atlantic region remained oligotrophic at least during the past 50 ka BP, but additional studies are required to support this result in terms of nitrogen oceanic budget. During the phases of enhanced ice-rafted detrital supply corresponding to prominent Heinrich events (HL1, HL2, HL4, and HL5), fine-sized sedimentary organic matter has lower OC and TN concentrations, contrasting sharply with those of ambient glacial sediments. Lower delta(13)C (down to -28parts per thousand) and delta(15)N (down to 1.6parts per thousand) values and high OC:TN ratios (up to 14.7 +/- 1. 1) are found for HL1, HL2, and with lesser extent for HL4. These values reflect enhanced detrital supply originating from poorly differentiated soil horizons that characterise periglacial climate conditions and from organic matter-bearing rock sources of the underlying geological basement. During HL5, only the delta(13)C offset records the input of fine size ice-rafted organic matter. Gradually changing soil development conditions during the time interval covering HL5 to HL1 (marine isotope stages 5 to 2), as well as varying erosion levels, have been hypothesized on the basis of constant delta(13)C, increasing OC/TN and decreasing delta(15)N values.

AB Pistacia atlantica trees have a very limited distribution in wadis in the central Negev highlands, and erosive processes may have a negative impact on the recruitment and survival of the trees. We measured the sizes of the trunks of adult trees, the condition of their canopies, fruit density, insect herbivory, and soil parameters-both in eroded and noneroded habitats. This was to determine the habitat soil quality and how it relates to the demographic disposition and vitality of these trees. The results revealed irregular size/age distribution and possible poor recruitment. There were no differences in fruit density between trees in eroded and noneroded habitats. However, analysis on gall density per branch revealed that Slavum wertheimae prefer host plants in relatively uneroded habitats. Analysis of water-holding capacity, soil organic carbon content, and pH revealed significant differences, with better soil quality existing in noneroded areas.

AB Maintaining and/or conserving organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in the soil using management practices can improve its fertility and productivity and help to reduce global warming by sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and N-2. We examined the influence of 6 years of tillage (no-till, NT; chisel plowing, CP; and moldboard plowing, MP), cover crop (hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) vs. winter weeds), and N fertilization (0, 90, and 180 kg N ha(-1)) on soil organic C and N concentrations in a Norfolk sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic, Typic Kandiudults) under tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and silage corn (Zea mays L.). In a second experiment, we compared the effects of 7 years, of non-legume (rye (Secale cereale L.)) and legume (hairy vetch and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.)) cover crops and N fertilization (HN (90 kg N ha(-1) for tomato and 80 kg N ha(-1) for eggplant)) and FN (180 kg N ha(-1) for tomato and 160 kg N ha(-1) for eggplant) on soil organic C and N in a Greenville fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic, Rhodic Kandiudults) under tomato and eggplant (Solanum melogena L.). Both experiments were conducted from 1994 to 2000 in Fort Valley, GA. Carbon concentration in cover crops ranged from 704 kg ha(-1) in hairy vetch to 3704 kg ha(-1) in rye in 1999 and N concentration ranged from 77 kg ha(-1) in rye in 1996 to 299 kg ha(-1) in crimson clover in 1997. With or without N fertilization, concentrations of soil organic C and N were greater in NT with hairy vetch than in MP with or without hairy vetch (23.5-24.9 vs. 19.9-21.4 Mg ha(-1) and 1.92-2.05 vs. 1.58-1.76 Mg ha(-1) respectively). Concentrations of organic C and N were also greater with rye, hairy vetch, crimson clover, and FN than with the control without a cover crop or N fertilization (17.5-18.4 vs. 16.5 Mg ha(-1) and 1.33-1.43 vs. 1.31 Mg ha(-1), respectively). From 1994 to 1999, concentrations of soil organic C and N decreased by 8-16% in NT and 15-25% in CP and MP. From 1994 to 2000, concentrations of organic C and N decreased by 1% with hairy vetch and crimson clover, 2-6% with HN and FN, and 6-18% with the control. With rye, organic C and N increased by 3-4%. Soil organic C and N concentrations can be conserved and/or maintained by reducing their loss through mineralization and erosion, and by sequestering atmospheric CO2 and N-2 in the soil using NT with cover crops and N fertilization. These changes in soil management improved soil quality and productivity. Non-legume (rye) was better than legumes (hairy vetch and crimson clover) and N fertilization in increasing concentrations of soil organic C and N. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COMPACTION
AB The concept of soil quality has received considerable interest as a measure of the environmental impact of agriculture. Such measures are increasingly important as agriculturalists (and their customers) move to include depreciation of natural capital in the assessment of farm performance. As a concept, soil quality has numerous advantages, but its application has several potential disadvantages. In particular, soil quality criteria are site specific and relate to the particular purpose of a user, unlike the criteria used to assess air and water quality. Soil structure is considered an important component of soil quality. The tablelands of south eastern Australia, where grazing of livestock is the dominant land use, are a significant source of surface water and groundwater supplies for a large part of the continent. Degrading soil structure will alter the relationship between infiltration and runoff, thereby impacting on soil erosion, pasture production and catchment health. A long term replicated experiment has been established at The University of Sydney, Orange, to determine the most appropriate tools to quantify changes in soil structure under alternate grazing systems. A number of soil properties relating to soil structure are under investigation, including soil hydraulic conductivity, image analysis of pore geometry, penetration resistance and soil microbial activity, as well as conventional measurements of bulk density and organic carbon. These methods are discussed, and results from the first year are reported. It is hoped that these results will enable soil structure change to be incorporated into grazing management decision models.

AB Conservation tillage is a soil management practice able to reduce erosion, increase organic matter content and improve physical, chemical and biological soil properties, Conservation tillage reduces the incorporation of crop residues into the soil profile and minimises the exposure of humified organic matter to biotic and abiotic degradative processes. In this article the effect of conventional (ploughing at 40-cm depth coupled with harrowing at 20-cm depth) and reduced tillage (hat-rowing at 20-cm depth) and two rotations (vetch-oat/wheat and fallow/wheat) on biochemical and microbial properties of a Vertic Ustorthens, located in a semi-arid region of southern Italy, has been investigated. Tillage had a more pronounced effect on soil properties studied here than did rotations. By comparison to conventional tillage (CT), the reduced tillage (RT) resulted in improved soil C and microbial biomass content. Even though some of the selected enzymes showed seasonal variability and, when averaged across the sampling period, were not always able to discriminate among treatments, their sum showed a strong correlation with soil organic C and soil microbial biomass C (MBC), for all these parameters increased in RT plots.

AB Although arable landscapes have a long history, environmental problems have accelerated in recent decades. The effects of these changes are usually externalised, being greater for society as a whole than for the farms on which they operate, and incentives to correct them are therefore largely lacking. Arable landscapes are valued by society beyond the farming community, but increased mechanisation and farm size, simplification of crop rotations, and loss of non-crop features, have led to a reduction in landscape diversity. Low intensity arable systems have evolved a characteristic and diverse fauna and flora, but development of high input, simplified arable systems has been associated with a decline in biodiversity. Arable intensification has resulted in loss of non-crop habitats and simplification of plant and animal communities within crops, with consequent disruption to food chains and declines in many farmland species. Abandonment of arable management has also led to the replacement of such wildlife with more common and widespread species. Soils have deteriorated as a result of erosion, compaction, loss of organic, matter and contamination with pesticides, and in some areas, heavy metals. Impacts on water are closely related to those on soils as nutrient and pesticide pollution of water results from surface runoff and subsurface flow, often associated with soil particles, which themselves have economic and ecological impacts. Nitrates and some pesticides also enter groundwater following leaching from arable land. Greatest impacts are associated with simplified, high input arable systems. Intensification of arable farming has been associated with pollution of air by pesticides, NO2 and CO2, while the loss of soil organic matter has reduced the system's capacity for carbon sequestration. International trade contributes to global climate change through long distance transport of arable inputs and products. The EU Rural Development Regulation (1257/99) provides an opportunity to implement measures for alleviating ecological impacts of arable management through a combination of cross-compliance and agri-environment schemes. To alleviate the problems described in this paper, such measures should take account of opportunities for public/private partnerships and should integrate social, cultural; economic and ecological objectives for multifunctional land use.

AB A better understanding of tillage effects on soil organic matter is vital for development of effective soil conservation practices. The objective of this research is to determine the effect of tillage and crop sequence on soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) content in an irrigated southern Alberta soil. A field experiment was conducted using a split-split plot design from 1994 to 1998 in Alberta, Canada. There were two crop sequences {Sequence 1: spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.)-spring wheat-annual legume; and Sequence 2: spring wheat-spring wheat-annual legume-sugar beet) and two tillage practices (CT: conventional tillage and MT: minimum tillage). Surface soil under MT had significantly higher OC (30.1 Mg ha(-1)) content than under CT (28.3 Mg ha(-1)) after 4 years of treatment. The MT treatment retains crop residue at the soil surface, reduces soil erosion and slows organic matter decomposition, which are key factors in enhancing the soil fertility status of southern Alberta irrigated soils.

AB The targeting of sediment management strategies is a key requirement in developing countries because of the limited resources available. Such targeting is, however, hampered by the lack of reliable information on catchment sediment sources. This paper reports the results of using a quantitative composite fingerprinting technique to estimate the relative importance of the primary potential sources within the upper Kaleya catchment (63 km(2)) in southern Zambia. During the study period (1997-9), the load-weighted mean relative contributions to the sediment load sampled at the catchment outlet were in the order: commercial cultivation (2.0%), bush grazing (17.1%), channel banks/gullies (17.2%) and communal cultivation (63.7%). Although influenced by the timing of sediment sample collection, these results are judged to provide a meaningful assessment of sediment sources in the Kaleya catchment. They indicate that improved environmental management strategies for the study area, must be comprehensives and need to reduce surface erosion and hillslope/channel connectivity in areas of bush grazing and both communal and commercial cultivation and to control gully development.

AB An experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of green manure and sewage sludge to reduce the erosion of (1) a mine tailing and (2) its leachate residue following lime treatments. Green manure(GM) was the only treatment that stabilised each material to some extent. In response to green manure plus sludge (SSGM) or sludge (SS), the mine tailing had the smallest increases in stability, where neither treatment significantly changed its poor structure. For the tailings, the effectiveness of the treatments was in the order (descending) of GM > SS = SSGM. For leachate residue material, the effectiveness of the treatments was in the order (descending) of GM=SSGM>SS. When SS was treated (as if it were a soil), the GM, and SSGM treatment combination yielded the most stables aggregates, because the number of simulated raindrops needed for aggregate breakdown was always at least 25% higher than that of all other samples except the leachate residue control. The resistance of the leachate residue to raindrop impact was attributed to thixotropic effects caused by its gypsum fraction. For all materials, stability against the counted number of water drops (CND) was not significantly increased by sludge. However, after incubation with GM, sludge resisted 50% more water drops than GM-treated mine tailings or tailings leachate residue. In the present study GM-impregnated sludge resists erosion to a far greater degree than the sludge to which GM had not been previously applied. This has implications for the treatment of sludge prior to its application to mine spoils.

AB The fate of soil organic matter during erosion and sedimentation has been difficult to assess because of the large size and complex turnover characteristics of the soil carbon reservoir. It has been assumed that most of the carbon released during erosion is lost to oxidation. Budgets of bulk soil and soil organic carbon erosion and deposition suggest that the primary fates of eroded soil carbon across the conterminous United States are trapping in impoundments and other redeposition. The total amount of soil carbon eroded and redeposited across the United States is similar to 04 Gt yr(-1). Applying this revision to the U. S. carbon budget by Houghton et al. [1999] raises their net sequestration estimate by 20-47 %. If comparable rates of erosion and redeposition occur globally, net carbon sequestration would be similar to1 Gt yr(-1).

AB Using polyacrylamide (PAM) to reduce soil erosion in irrigated land has increased rapidly in recent years. A simple and reliable method to measure the PAM concentration in waters containing dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of great importance in assessing the fate and efficiency of PAM application. In this research, an analytical method to determine the PAM concentration of waters with correction for DOM interference was developed and tested. The method is based on a combination of determining the total concentration of amide groups by the N-bromination method (NBM) and determining the DOM content spectrophotometrically. The total concentration of amide groups of both PAM and DOM was determined by NBM at 570 nm. The DOM moiety, which is proportional to DOM concentration, was determined by spectrophotometry using a UV 254-nm wavelength. The actual PAM concentration of a water sample (soil extract containing PAM in this study) was obtained from NBM readings subtracted by the interferential DOM contribution using a correction curve. Analysis of PAM in two soil-water samples showed that the recoveries ranged from 94 to 100.3% for the 2 mg/L PAM sample and from 98.4 to 101.4% for the 10 mg/L PAM sample with various DOM concentrations. The coefficients of variation were <6% in all cases.

ID NITROGEN; INPUT
AB Data are presented on the effects of modern farming practices on soil as an agricultural resource in England and Wales (E&W), namely: nutrient status, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), heavy metal concentrations, and on soil erosion risk. Fertilizer-N inputs to tillage (arable) and grassland soils increased from 84 and 65 kg/ha N in 1969 to 151 and 120 kg/ha N, respectively, in 1997. The estimated N surplus (inputs less outputs) increased from 84 and 96 kg/ha N to 102 and 154 kg/ha N, respectively, over the same time. Phosphorus inputs to tillage (mean 37 kg/ha P) and grassland (mean 21 kg/ha P) changed little over the period. However, P surpluses decreased from 25 kg/ha P in 1969 to 15 kg/ha P in 1997 on tillage land (largely as a result of greater P offtakes), and from 20 to 17 kg/ha P in 1997 on grassland (largely because of a small decrease in fertilizer P). The cumulative tillage land soil P surplus was e. 580 kg/ha P, and was estimated to increase topsoil total P concentrations by c. 170 mg/kg P and Olsen-extractable soil P by c. 26 mg/1 P. The mean annual P surplus for grassland was 18 kg/ha P which, over the study period, added c. 427 kg/ha P to the soil, an increase in topsoil total P of e. 214 mg/kg P, and in Olsen-extractable P of 19 mg/1 P.
   Concentrations of SOC in some soils have decreased between 1980 and 1995, especially where soils have been ploughed out of grassland and on lowland organic and peaty soils in tillage. The mean SOC of soils in arable/ley cultivation in 1980 was 3.4 % and 2.8 % in 1995.
   The proportion of arable soils with pH < 6.0 decreased from 10 % in 1969-73 to 4 % in 1990-93, reflecting the better targeting of lime inputs. In contrast, the proportion of grassland soils with pH < 6.0 increased from 39 % in 1969-73 to 56 % in 1990-93.
   Although there were statistically significant changes in the mean soil concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn between 1980 and 1995, many of the changes were small in absolute terms. Hence, there was little evidence of marked or systematic changes in topsoil total heavy metal concentrations that could not be explained by factors other than increased pollutant loadings.
   Over the next 50 years or so, the threat from soil erosion to crop productivity will be greatest on shallow soils (less than or equal to c. 0.3 m depth), mostly over chalk and sandstone as further removal of soil will lead to increased drought stress. Provided that nutrient supplies are maintained, the evidence is that losses in arable crops on eroded soils would range between 2 % and 8 % of current yields.
   Thus, within the limitations of the data available, both in time and space, we found little evidence that most soils in E&W cannot continue to support modern farming practices, and the associated crop and animal outputs, given appropriate inputs of nutrients and an adequate degree of crop protection.

AB There are a number of uncertainties in the use of (137)Cs as a marker for deriving soil erosion rates. However, this should not limit other potential uses of this anthropogenic radionuclide in the study of soil landscape processes. This study outlines a sampling methodology which aids in the assessment of the history of erosion and depositional processes within a landscape unit. The depth distribution of (137)Cs and soil organic carbon (SOC) was utilized as a means of determining the erosion and depositional history of a conventionally tilled agricultural field in southern Ontario, Canada. Three transects oriented along the slope of a large field had five soil profiles excavated at the summit, sideslope, shoulder slope, footslope and toeslope landscape positions. The soils were sampled in 5 cm increments, and (137)Cs and SOC were determined on the samples. The results show that soil redistribution within landscape units of agricultural fields has been substantial both before and after fallout of (137)Cs to the soil surface. Soils in depositional areas contained significant (137)Cs and SOC at depths beyond which the plow can attain at present. This implies that a significant amount of carbon is being sequestered beneath the present plow layer. and the characterization of this pool must be considered in deriving the dynamics of SOC in agroecosystems.

Especially red deer populations, calculated at 20 ind./100 ha, surpass the carrying capacity of the forests observed. Trampling (by red deer and moufflon) and, rooting (wild boar) result in extensive soil disturbances, visible as soil profile mixture and soil erosion. We examined eight oak forests (Quercus petraea) located on slopes ranging from 24 to 34 degrees. Four sites are exposed to the southwest (windward) and four sites are exposed to the northeast (leeward), each containing two sites with disturbed and two with undisturbed soils. The content of macronutrients (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+), pH-value and Al3+ content as well as biotic soil properties such as abundance of soil, mesofauna. (Collembola, Oribatei) were mainly affected by exposition with higher values (lower values for Al3+) at leeward sites. In contrast, organic carbon (C-org) and nitrogen (N-t) of the upper soil depended exclusively on soil disturbance (ANOVA) with lower contents in disturbed soils. Microbial activity and biomass as well as PO43--P and NO3--N contents were significantly influenced by both factors. We found lower values at disturbed windward sites. The results clearly demonstrate the impact of game on soil degradation especially at windward sites.

AB Severe erosion, initiated by climatic changes during the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene period and resultant declines in dust deposition, causes the formation of waterfalls during the winter floods in many wadi systems in the central Negev desert of Israel, In some areas, erosion of the original loess substrate has been complete, so that the underlying rock has been exposed. We examined the effects of this erosion in four wadis in the central Negev desert on soil nutrients, plant community structure and plant quality. We predicted that erosion has caused reductions in soil nutrients. Reductions in soil nutrients should result in reductions in plant cover. Furthermore, reduced soil nutrient availability should cause reductions in the nutrient status and quality of the plants growing there. In addition to the loss of biodiversity that may result, this erosion may result in economic hardship for the Bedouin peoples whose herds depend on these resources. In this study, there were significant negative effects of erosion on soil organic carbon, nitrate nitrogen and water-holding capacity, but not on soil phosphorus, conductivity or pH. Furthermore, there was a negative effect of soil erosion on an overall measure of soil quality derived from a principal components analysis in three of the four wadis we studied. Erosion resulted in an increase in plant species richness and significantly altered plant community structure in eroded areas of wadis. Increased plant species richness in eroded sites is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis of plant community structure. Plants growing in eroded areas did not differ in two quality indices (nitrogen content and digestibility), although plants typical of eroded areas had significantly lower levels of common digestion inhibitors (total polyphenols) and toxins (alkaloids) than plants from undisturbed sites. These last-mentioned results are contrary to our prediction and are consistent with the notion that plants growing in disturbed (e.g. eroded) sites maximize growth at the expense of investments in defense.

AB Nutrient and organic carbon (OC) losses are important components of the soil degradation processes produced by continuous agriculture. It was hypothesized that coarse textured soils will be more affected by cultivation than fine textured ones. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the status of OC, total nitrogen (Nt), and three phosphorous fractions (total inorganic, Pi,organic, Po; and available, Pa) in different textured virgin (under Prosopis caldenia forest) and cultivated soils of the semi-arid pampa of Argentina. Three virgin and non-fertilized cultivated soil pairs, representative from soils of the region, were selected for this study: two fine sandy loam Entic Haplustolls and a sandy Typic Ustipsamment. The element content of each soil was analysed from the < 0.1-mm to 0.1-2-mm sized aggregates. Results indicated that cultivation decreased the OC, Po and Pi contents in fine aggregates of the fine textured soils, and in coarse aggregates of the coarse textured soil. Plant absorption and wind erosion were probably the main processes which decreased element contents in both textural soil types. It was speculated that in the sandy soil the elements lost from fine sized aggregates were restored by the break down of the weak coarse aggregates produced by tillage. The C/N ratios showed mostly small changes due to cultivation, indicating that no changes of organic matter quality occurred. Only the sandy soil showed C/N increases in the fine sized aggregates and decreases in the coarse sized aggregates. The C/Po quotients were not changed by cultivation, indicating that the qualitative composition of P organic compounds remained unchanged. Large OC decreases and Pa increases after cultivation detected in one of the fine textured soil were apparently linked to the occurrence of natural fires. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB The distribution of particulate organic carbon (POC) along the lower reaches is similar between the dry season and the flood season in the Yalujiang Estuary, North China. However, the values of particulate organic carbon of the upperstream in the dry season are one magnitude lower than the concentrations in the flood season. Stable carbon isotope ratios have been used to study the sources of particulate organic carbon in the Yalujiang Estuary. The isotopic composition of POC shows a range from -23.1 parts per thousand to -29.4 parts per thousand with a little seasonal variation. The isotopic evidence indicates that the POC in the Yalujiang Estuary is predominantly of terrestrial origin rather than a result of in situ plankton. The study of the ratio of POC: Chla shows that the turbidity maximum plays an important role in POC cycle in the Yalujiang Estuary Organic detritus and soil erosion are the main contributions to POC in the turbidity maximum, especially in the flood season.

AB There is considerable discussion about the influence of soil management techniques on soil erosion, water use and conservation, and more recently carbon dioxide sequestration and waste disposal. The soil-atmosphere interface, particularly the seed bed layer is of particular concern to agronomists and soil scientists because it is the focus of the physical processes affecting crop establishment and biological activity. This paper evaluates the current knowledge (1) in modeling seedling emergence and residue decomposition, (2) seedbed structure and its resulting physical conditions, and (3) tillage operations affect on seedbed structure and residue distribution.

AB The burgeoning poultry industry in the southeastern US is presenting a major environmental problem of safe disposal of poultry litter (PL). In a comprehensive study, we explored ways of PL use in conservation tillage-based cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production systems on a Decatur silt loam soil in north Alabama, from 1996 to 1999. The study reported here-in presents the residual effects of PL applied to cotton in mulch-till (MT) and no-till (NT) conservation tillage systems in 1997 and 1998 cropping seasons on N uptake, growth, and yield of rye (Secale cereale, L.) cover crop and rotational corn (Zea mays L.) in 1999. Rye was grown without additional N, whereas corn was grown at three inorganic N levels (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha(-1)). Poultry litter was applied to cotton in 1997 and 1998 at 0, 100, and 200 kg N ha(-1). Residual N from PL applied to cotton in 1997 and 1998 produced up to 2.0 and 17.3 Mg ha(-1), respectively, of rye cover crop and corn biomass (includes 7.1 Mg ha(-1) of corn grain yield) without additional fertilizer. Therefore, in addition to supplying crop residues which reduce soil erosion, increase soil organic matter, and conserve soil moisture, the rye cover crop was able to scavenge residual N left by the cotton crop, which would otherwise, be at risk of being leached and pollute groundwater resources. Poultry litter applied to cotton also increased corn grain quality as shown by up to 100% increase in grain N content compared to the ON treatment. Using PL with a slower rate of N release compared to inorganic fertilizer to meet some of the N requirements of corn, will not only reduce N fertilizer costs for corn, but will also reduce the risk of nitrate N leaching into groundwater. The maximum amount of crop residues added to the cotton based cropping system by residual N from PL and inorganic N was 21.3 Mg ha(-1). This will lead to an increase in soil organic carbon and soil structure in the longs term and a reduction in soil erosion, thereby further improving soil productivity, while at the same time, protecting the environment from nitrate pollution and soil degradation. Our study demonstrates that cotton under conservation tillage system in combination with rye cover crop and rotational corn cropping could use large quantities of PL thereby avoiding serious potential environmental hazards.

AB Results of a case study of landform development and sedimentation in humid tropical lowland environments on Halmahera island, eastern Indonesia, are presented with the aim to better characterise tropical lowland environments in the context of Late Quaternary environmental change studies. First, the geologic, morphologic and environmental settings of the two areas, the interior Kao River plain and the Kao coastal zone (N. Halmahera), are presented. Subsequently, data concerning Late Pleistocene and Holocene landform development, sedimentation and coastal processes are discussed. Pleistocene landform development involved volcaniclastic, sedimentation, base levelling of coastal lowlands, prolonged weathering and crust formation, coastal uplift and eustatic sea level change. A conspicuous ferricrete crust in the subsoil of the coastal plain is tentatively dated with C-14 AMS analysis and isotopes of organic matter encapsulated in the soil ferricrete have been determined. Due to interacting sea level change, neotectonic uplift, climatic, hydrologic and vegetational change, unequivocal evidence for anomalous Late Pleistocene or Holocene environmental conditions is difficult to obtain. Durin- the Nhd-Late Holocene, a low-energy fluvial systems and swamps existed in the interior Kao River plain; a dense open swamp/swamp forest vegetation contributed to extremely high sedimentation rates in this depositional basin. Palynological analysis of the organic swamp deposits indicates little or no change in sedimentary environmental settings and swamp vegetations, and indications for early human presence in the area. In the coastal area accretion and delta progradation occurred after the Early-Mid Holocene formation of a marine erosion cliff. Tentative evidence for early human presence in the Kao area is derived from charcoal particle frequencies in sediments and the existence of natural grasslands in the coastal zone. As most of the geologic and environmental characteristics of the tropical lowlands in the Kao area are common in eastern Indonesia, the study provides useful information for ongoing research in the region.

AB We present here deductions about the location, rate, and mechanisms of chemical weathering in a small catchment based on a catchment-scale sprinkling experiment. In this experiment demineralized water was applied at an approximately steady rate in the CB1 catchment in the Oregon Coast Range to reach and maintain a quasi-steady discharge for a period of 4 days. Because of nearly steady flow conditions within the catchment, the contribution to solute fluxes from soil and bedrock could be partitioned. One half of the solute flux from the catchment derived from colluvial soil, and one half from weathering in bedrock. This implies more intense weathering in the thin colluvium mantling the catchment than in the thick underlying weathered bedrock. The annual solute flux from the catchment, scaled to the annual runoff from the catchment is 32 +/- 10 t km(-2) year(-1), equivalent to published chemical denudation rates for nearby rivers with drainage areas 10(6) times greater than the experiment site. Soil waters sampled during the sprinkling experiment had steady compositions following a period of transient water flow conditions, implying steady-state chemical evolution in the soil. The waters leached 'organic' anions from shallow depths in the soil, which solubilized aluminium and iron, indicating that podzolization is occurring in these soils. Carbonate dissolution appears to be an important source of solutes from the bedrock, despite being present as only a minor phase in the rock. Water balance suggests that the residence time of water in the catchment is about 2 months, and that typical 24 h storms displace only a fraction of the stored water. A consequence is that runoff chemistry is dominated by old water, which imposes strong limits on the variability of runoff composition. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sediment and total phosphorus (TP) export vary through space and time. This study was conducted to determine the factors controlling sediment and TP export in two agricultural catchments situated in the Belgian Loess Belt. At the outlet of these catchments runoff discharge was continuously measured and suspended sediment samples were taken during rainfall events. Within the catchments vegetation type and cover, soil surface parameters, erosion features, sediment pathways, and rainfall characteristics were monitored. Total P content and sediment characteristics such as clay, organic carbon, and suspended sediment concentration were correlated. Total sediment and TP export differ significantly between the monitored catchments. Much of the difference is due to the occurrence of an extreme event in one catchment and the morphology and spatial organization of land use in the catchments. In one catchment, the direct connection between erosive areas and the catchment outlet by means of a road system contributed to a high sediment delivery ratio (SDR) at the outlet. In the other catchment, the presence of a wide valley in the center of the catchment caused sediment deposition. Vegetation also had an effect on sediment production and deposition. Thus, many factors control sediment and TP export from small agricultural catchments; some of these factors are related to the physical catchment characterisics such as morphology and landscape structure and are (semi)permanent, while others, such as vegetation cover and land use, are time dependent.

AB The accelerated greenhouse effect and the degradation of land resources by water and wind erosion are two major, yet interrelated global environmental challenges. Accelerated decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) in cultivated soils results in decline in SOC stocks over time and also contributes to increased levels of CO(2) in the atmosphere. Off-site transport of SOC in runoff waters during erosional events also contributes to SOC depletion, but there is a paucity of data in the literature documenting erosional SOC losses and the fate of eroded SOC. In this paper, we present a mass balance approach to compute CO(2) evolved from mineralization of SOC during transport and deposition of eroded soils. Erosion-induced CO(2) emission rates ranging between 6 and 52 g C m(-2) yr(-1) were computed using data on SOC stocks and dynamics from a series of long-term experiments conducted across a range of ecological regions. For the cropland of the world, we estimated an annual flux of 0.37 Pg CO(2)-C to the atmosphere due to water erosion. This flux is significant and suggests that water erosion must be taken into consideration when constructing global and regional C budgets. Through its contribution to atmospheric CO(2) increase, water erosion can have a positive feedback on the accelerated greenhouse effect. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The watersheds at Bear Creek, Oak Ridge, TN, have similar soil-landscape relationships. The lower reaches of many of these watersheds consist of headwater riparian wetlands situated between sloping non-wetland upland zones. The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of (i) slops and geomorphic processes, (ii) human impacts, and (iii) particular characteristics of soils and saprolite that may effect drainage and water movement in the wetlands and adjacent landscapes in one of these watersheds. A transect was run from west to east in a hydrological monitored area at the lower reaches of a watershed on Bear Creek. This transect extended from a steep side slope position across a floodplain, a terrace. acid a shoulder slope, On the upland positions of the Nolichucky Shale, mass wasting, overland flow and soil creep currently inhibit soil formation on the steep side slope position where a Typic Dystrudept is present, while soil stability on the shoulder slope has resulted in the formation of a well-developed Typic Hapludult. In these soils, argillic horizons occur above C horizons on less sloping gradients in comparison to steeper slopes, which have Bw horizons over Cr (saprolite) material. A riparian wetland area occupies the floodplain section, where a Typic Endoaquept is characterized by poorly drained conditions that led to the development of redoximorphic features (mottling). gleying, organic matter accumulation, and minimal development of subsurface horizons. A thin colluvial deposit overlies a thick well developed Aquic Hapludalf that formed in alluvial sediments on the terrace position. The colluvial deposit from the adjacent shoulder slope is thought to result from soil creep and anthropogenic erosion caused by past cultivation practices. Runoff from the adjacent sloping landscape and groundwater from the adjacent wetland area perhaps contribute to the somewhat poorly drained conditions of this profile. Perched watertables occur in upland positions due to dense saprolite and clay plugging in the shallow zones of the saprolite. However, no redoximorphic features are observed in the soil on the side slope due to high runoff. Remnants of the underlying shale saprolite. which occur as small discolored zones resembling mottles, are also present. The soils in the study have a CEC of < 10 cmol kg(-1). silt loam textures and Fe-d values of 0.5-4.3%. These soils are also mainly acidic and low in total carbon. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Geomorphic erosion on hillslopes creates a distribution of soil properties within the landscape that influences ecosystem, erosional, and hydrological processes. These soil properties typically reflect topography and define a template for plant productivity and consequent soil carbon accumulation. Erosion also redistributes soil carbon and, by burying or excavating carbon, changes turnover time and may figure prominently in the global carbon budget [Stallard, 1998]. In this paper, we present the Changing Relief and Evolving Ecosystems Project (CREEP), a theoretical, process-response model that focuses on the redistribution of soil texture and soil carbon along a hillslope in response to geomorphic transport processes. The CREEP model simulates long-term ecological and geomorphic landscape evolution by simulating general soil, vegetation, and hillslope transport relationships. In particular, the model allows for the removal and downslope transport of soil carbon, as well as for the burial and decomposition of carbon in the accumulation zone. CREEP model results suggest that sandy soils are more likely to differentiate downslope with respect to soil texture than are more clay-rich soils and that this redistribution will lead to disproportionately broad areas of predominantly coarse-grained particles on upper slopes. Gridded biogeochemical models, which may otherwise overlook landscape heterogeneity, may use CREEP estimates of the areal distribution of soil texture as a basis for parametrically capturing trace gas fluxes nonlinearly related to soil texture.

AB The Santa Clara River is a prototypical small mountainous river, with a headwater height greater than 1000 m and a basin area smaller than 10,000 m(2). Although individual small mountainous rivers export trivial amounts of sediment and carbon to the ocean, as a group these rivers may export a major fraction las much as 50%) of the total global river sediment flux [Milliman and Syvitski, 1992], making their geochemistry relevant the study of the ocean's carbon cycle. In addition, many small rivers export sediment in a few high flux events, causing massive, sporadic discharge of carbon onto coastal shelves, discharge conditions very different from those of large rivers. This class of rivers is an end-member of the river-ocean carbon exchange system, opposite the Earth's largest river, the Amazon. The carbon mass and isotopic properties of the Santa Clara River are significantly different from previously studied large rivers. During the 1997-1998 winter, all Santa Clara carbon pools were old, with flux-weighted average Delta (14)C values of -428 +/- 76 parts per thousand for particulate organic carbon, -73 +/- 31 parts per thousand for dissolved organic carbon, and -644 +/- 58 parts per thousand for black carbon. The age of exported carbon is primarily due to the deep erosion of old soils and not to inclusion of fossil fuel carbon. Additionally, the delta (13)C signatures of exported carbon pools were high relative to terrestrial carbon, bearing a signature quite similar to marine carbon (average particulate organic carbon (POC) delta (13)C = -22.2 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand). The Santa Clara's estuary is small and drains onto the narrow eastern Pacific coastal margin, exporting this old soil organic matter directly into the ocean. If the Santa Clara export patterns are representative of this class of rivers, they may be a significant source of refractory terrestrial carbon to the ocean.

AB Ridge tillage is a special conservation tillage method, but the long-term effect of this tillage system on crop yield and soil quality in a corn (Zea mays L,) and soybean [Glycine mm (L.) Merr.] rotation is largely unknown in the northern Corn Belt of the USA. Our objectives were to compare crop performance and soil condition at three nitrogen-fertilizer levels under ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). The experiment was started in 1990 at Brookings, SD, on a Barnes clay loam (US soil taxonomy: fine-loamy, mixed Udic Haploboroll; FAO classification: Chernozem). CT included moldboard or chisel plowing, seedbed preparation with tandem disk and field cultivator, and raw cultivation. Raised beds under RT were maintained using only row cultivation. Corn grain yield was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.10) greater on CT than on RT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) corn yield was 6267 kg ha(-1) with RT and 6500 kg ha(-1) with CT. Soybean grain yield was not significantly (p less than or equal to 0.10) different between RT and CT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) soybean yield was 1997 kg ha(-1) with RT and 2058 kg ha(-1) with CT. In 9 of 11 years there was a significant soybean-yield response to N-starter fertilizer. There was no significant accumulation of NO3-N in the top 3 m of soil at the end of 9 years in either tillage treatment (111 kg NO3-N ha(-1) under RT and 121 kg NO3-N ha(-1) under CT). Soil pH in the top 15 cm was unaffected by tillage (average pH was 6.62). In 1999, soil organic C in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under CT (56 Mg ha(-1)) than under RT (52 Mg ha(-1)). Bulk density in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under RT (1.52 g cm(-3)) than under CT (1.44 gr cm(-3)). Tillage did not have a great effect on grain yield or soil properties. RT can protect soil from erosion because crop residues remain relatively undisturbed on the soil surface in contrast to chisel plow. In this respect, we expect RT to be more sustainable over the long term than chisel plow tillage. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prokaryotes have been cultured from a modern weathering profile developed on a similar to 365-million-year-old black share that use macromolecular share organic matter as their sole organic carbon source. Using natural-abundance carbon-14 analysis of membrane Lipids, we show that 74 to 94% of Lipid carbon in these cultures derives from assimilation of carbon-14-free organic carbon from the share. These results reveal that microorganisms enriched from share weathering profiles are able to use a macromolecular and putatively refractory pool of ancient organic matter. This activity may facilitate the oxidation of sedimentary organic matter to inorganic carbon when sedimentary rocks are exposed by erosion. Thus, microorganisms may play a more active role in the geochemical carbon cycle than previously recognized, with profound implications for controls on the abundance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere over geologic time.

AB In order to quantify the historical changes in carbon storage that result from agricultural conversion, this study compared the carbon dynamics of two sites in the loess region of Iowa: a native prairie and a cropland. Field data were obtained to determine present-day carbon storage and its variability within a landscape (a stable ridgetop vs. eroding upper-midslope vs. depositional lower slope). Models were used to recreate the historical carbon budget of these sites and determine the cropland's potential to be a net CO2 source or sink, relative to the atmosphere.
   Regardless of slope position, the cropland site contains approximately half the amount of carbon as prairie. Variability in soil carbon storage within a site as a consequence of slope position is as large or larger (variations of 200-300%) than temporal variation (similar to 200% at all slope positions). The most extreme difference in soil carbon storage between the cropland and prairie sites is found in the soil at the upper-midslope, which is the area of greatest erosion. The models estimate that 93-172% of the carbon in the original topsoil has been lost from the cropland's eroding midslope. Much of this carbon is derived from deeper soil horizons. Either a small sink or strong source of carbon to the atmosphere is created, depending on the fate of the eroded sediment and its associated carbon.

AB The agricultural sustainability of small-holder agriculture in semi-arid northern Nigeria was assessed. Topsoil (0-30 cm) samples from cultivated and uncultivated soils were analysed for texture, pH, exchangeable cations, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total and available potassium and phosphorus. Comparison of data from cultivated and uncultivated soils revealed that cultivation led to losses of fine soil particles, organic carbon and total nitrogen as well as a reduction in cation exchange capacity and available water-holding capacity. The level of soil clay was shown to have the greatest influence on agricultural sustainability. It is recommended that soil conservation, especially the reduction of soil loss by erosion, should be emphasized in order to enhance agricultural sustainability. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB Soil erosion contributes to the removal of soil organic carbon (SOC) from cultivated soils and its entrapment in terrestrial depressions. The fate of SOC entrapped in terrestrial deposits is largely unknown, but there has been speculation that such entrapment could lead to C sequestration, thereby playing a role in global C cycling. It has been hypothesized that the fate of eroded C in these deposits depends on SOC quality (bioavailability) and the environmental conditions at the depositional site. The SOC storage and dynamics were studied in cultivated, forested, and deposited soils at sites with and without subsurface tile-drainage. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), readily mineralizable C (MinC), and basal soil respiration (BSR) rates were used as SOC quality indicators and were assessed in field-moist soil aggregates of four sizes: 2-3 nun, 1-2 mm, 0.5-1 mm and <0.5 mm. Soil organic carbon inventory (mass of C over the depth sampled) was significantly different (P < 0.01) among the land uses and was in the order: deposit > forest > cropland. It was also significantly (P < 0.1) different between the two deposits, amounting to 14.6 and 17.1 kg C m(-2) in the tile-drained and undrained deposits, respectively. Over that same depth, the total SOC pool in the forest soil was 9.5 kg C m(-2). Overall, the various aggregate sizes did not differ significantly in terms of their total SOC content, but the SOC quality indicators (MBC, MinC, and BSR) were generally higher in the larger than in the smaller aggregates. These indices were also higher in the forest and depression sites than in the croplands. The data indicated that cultivation and erosion resulted in depletion of both total and labile SOC, but the labile pools were depleted at rates 1.5 to 3 times faster. Conversely, there was an enrichment in both clay (1.4 to 2 times) and SOC (1.3 to 1.6 times) in the depression areas, indicating removal of fine particle-associated SOC from the cultivated fields and its entrapment in the deposits. However, the levels of labile C (MBC, MinC) in the entrapped materials were 20 to 46% lower than would be anticipated based on their total C contents. These reductions suggest that, compared with the forest and cropland, a relatively greater proportion of the C retained in the deposits is in the slow and passive pools, and that distribution is favorable to sequestration of C in these landscape positions.

AB Cable-logging is a method commonly used to harvest native forests on steep slopes in Tasmania, Australia. A study was carried out to determine impacts on site disturbance and selected soil properties resulting from cable-logging wet eucalypt forest developed on granite substrates in northeastern Tasmania. The results show that both the area and depth of soil surface disturbance are relatively minor, with ca. 11% of the study coupe affected by moderate (Litter and part topsoil removed) or severe (subsoil exposed) disturbance. Cable draglines accounted for just over 7% of the soil disturbance (7% moderate and 0.2% severe), whereas tree uprooting associated with the logging accounted for a further 3% moderate disturbance and 1% severe disturbance. Measurements of soil properties in the surface layer (0-10 cm) show that bulk density is ca. 20% higher and organic carbon content (kg/ha) is 15% lower on cable draglines compared to undisturbed sites. However, the dominant type of soil disturbance caused by cable-logging appears to have been displacement of the upper IO cm of topsoil from the centre to the outside edges of draglines rather than compaction in situ. Comparison of the data with studies of ground-based logging of wet native forests elsewhere in southeastern Australia shows that cable-logging has resulted in significantly less impact on both area of soil disturbed and soil properties. The results are also discussed in relation to relevant sustainability indicators (soil erosion, organic matter and compaction) specified in Criterion 4 of the Montreal Process together with recently proposed threshold values.

AB Four representative profiles of poorly developed soils on consolidated material were studied in the Sierra de Carrascoy (SE Spain). The soils, with A-A/R or A-C/R type profiles, have medium-low contents of organic carbon and nitrogen, and calcium carbonate occurs in only one of the profiles. The pH in aqueous suspension is slightly alkaline. The cation exchange capacity is medium-low, but varies slightly between profiles, and the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is low. There are wide textural differences. The clay fractions contain illite, kaolinite, vermiculite, smectites, chlorite, quartz and feldspars. The heavy fraction of the fine sand contains mainly opaque minerals and alterites, with some resistant minerals of metamorphic origin. The profiles are classified by F.A.O-I.S.R.I.C.-I.S.S.S. [World Reference Base for Soil Resources. World Soil Resources Reports 84, F.A.O,, Rome, 1998] as Calcaric, Eutric and Hyperskeletic Leptosols. According to Soil Survey Staff [Soil Taxonomy. A basic system of soil classification for making and interpreting soil surveys, 2nd edn., United States Department of Agriculture. Natural Resources Conservation Service. US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1999], they are all Lithic and Typic Xerorthents and Lithic Xeric and Xeric Torriorthents, The principal present-day pedogenetic processes in these soils are humification and clay formation. However, profile I has evolved from a fersiallitic soil with clay accumulation, although these features have almost disappeared because of erosion and modem humification, pedoturbation and recalcification. Its relict features consist of the remains of a paleoargic horizon inherited from earlier climatic conditions, which was later truncated and is now preserved only in more stable physiographic positions.

AB Studies on dispersive behavior of semiarid soils upon application of water are very important since such soils are often irrigated and followed by dry periods. The outcome of such treatments on the soils affect the soil physical properties adversely leading to wind erosion. The objective was to determine the water-dispersibility of the send-arid soils and the contribution of their electrolyte and soil organic carbon (SOC) content in their dispersibility. The soils are mainly Cambic Arenosols (FAO) or Typic Xeropsamments (USDA Soil Taxonomy), kaolinitic with few smectite and low in cation exchange capacity. Ten topsoil samples from 0-20 cm depth for this study were collected from the aeolian zones of northern Nigeria. Total clay content of the soils varied between 6 and 16% while water-dispersible clay was low (4-8%) and a reflection of the low total clay content. Organic carbon (OC) correlated significantly with WDC (r = 0.57) while exchangeable Na+ also correlated significantly with total clay (DC) and WDC (r = 0.84,0.67) respectively Organic carbon, and exchangeable Na+, influenced water-dispersible clay content while exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR) and electrolytic conductivity (EC) correlated significantly with clay-dispersion ratio (CDR).

AB This study evaluated seasonal variability in the quantity and quality of particulate organic matter exported by the Columbia River into its estuary. Samples of suspended particulate material (SPM), collected monthly over a 1 year period (Nov ember 1995-October 1996) from a freshwater site in the Columbia River, near the head of its estuary, were analyzed for total aluminum, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PN, respectively) and algal pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids). High Al content, averaging 7.9% by weight throughout the year, indicated that detrital minerals accounted for the majority of SPM mass at all times. Organic matter (approximately 2 X POC) varied on a seasonal basis both in terms of its mass contribution to SPM (5-26% by weight) and its chemical composition. In winter, organic matter originated mainly from allochthonous sources, most likely from erosion of soils. Diatoms, the major phytoplankton group present as inferred from pigment analysis, "bloomed" in April-June 1996, resulting in increased autochthonous contribution to POC during spring and summer as well as increased organic matter content of SPM introduced to the estuary. Comparison with results for the same site in the mainstem Columbia obtained between 1990 and 1999 as part of a land-margin ecosystem research project shows that enhanced algal production in springtime is not a feature unique to our data set, at least in the Columbia River's present highly regulated state of hydrographic operation. The possibility is discussed that recent human influence, principally dam construction, has significantly altered the historical SPM concentration and the chemical composition of its associated organic matter.

AB Microbiotic soil crusts, mostly formed by cyanobacteria, are widespread on the surface of fallow land in western Niger. They lie adjacent to completely bare soils. We have investigated the structural stability of these soils by testing aggregate breakdown under fast-wetting, slow-wetting and mechanical breakdown. The tests were effected on aggregates ranging from 3 to 5 mm in size. These experiments were completed by micromorphological examinations under light and scanning electron microscope.
   For all tests, the fragment size distribution and the mean weight diameter (MWD) revealed the great stability of aggregates from soils with a cyanobacterial cover (MWD 1.82 to 3.10 mm), compared to those from soils devoid of cyanobacterial cover (MWD 0.25 to 1.26 mm). Fast- and slow-wetting of microbiotic soil crust material induced a lesser disaggregation of aggregates compared to mechanical breakdown. On the contrary, fast-wetting and mechanical breakdown of aggregates from soils devoid of cyanobacterial cover induced a greater disaggregation than slow-wetting.
   Microscopic examination of microbiotic crusts revealed an intricate network of filamentous cyanobacteria and extracellular polymer secretions, which binds and entraps mineral particles on the soil surface. Organo-mineral aggregates ranging from 0.10 to 0.12 mm were observed. Below the superficial crusts, filaments and residual organic matter bind tightly soil particles, thus giving a compact structure. The great stability of aggregates of soil with cyanobacterial cover is likely related to the binding and gluing effect of cyanobacteria and derived organic matter. This is consistent with the positive correlation between MWD values and organic carbon content. The present results thereby confirm the resistance to erosion of soil with microbial cover as indicated by field measurements. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sandy soils formed from granitic rocks on Miocene-aged and older land surfaces cover a large area of central Zimbabwe. These deeply weathered soils are an important agricultural resource for the country yet susceptible to erosion with agricultural use, and decreases in productivity and sustainability have been documented. Regional-based surveys of Zimbabwe have evaluated the general extent of erosion, but site-specific data to determine soil properties related to erosional susceptibility and influence of management are lacking in this area. This study measured physical and chemical properties of five sites (10 pedons) in an area of granitic soils east of the city of Harare. Sites were from university research, commercial, and communal farms. Pedons were paired to determine soil property differences in row crop vs. pasture management. The objectives of this study were to (a) verify important soil properties that influence erosional susceptibility and productivity of these granitic soils, and (b) determine differences in those properties as related to agriculture management. Results indicate important properties that favor high erosional susceptibility in these soils are coarse textures and high degree of weathering (resulting in extractable bases and cation exchange capacity < 10 cmol kg(-1)), and low organic C (ranging from 2.5 to 23.5 g kg(-1) C in surface horizons). Pedons in pasture have 2 to 19 cm thicker A horizons, water dispersible to total clay ratios 3% to 17% lower, and greater aggregate stability relative to the paired, cropped pedons. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) at 15 to 30 cm depth ranges from 0.2 to 23.4 cm h(-1) for all pedons. Greater K-sat in cropped pedons relative to the pasture pair is likely temporal and influenced by tillage. Bulk density and extractable-P exhibit no trends with management and such results are likely confounded by management history such as crop-pasture rotations and fertilization. This study has shown the importance of increasing and maintaining soil C levels to minimize agricultural-induced erosion of these granitic soils. Results suggest that soil textures and the weathered nature of these soils in this semitropical climate produce conditions where organic matter is generally low even in soils maintained in pasture. Therefore, use of conservation management practices will be required to maintain and build adequate soil tilth and fertility for sustainable crop production. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A knowledge of the kinetics of organic matter transformations in arable soils is important for managing them sustainably. Our aim in this study was to elucidate the effects of cropping period on pools of C and N in coarse-textured savanna soils of the South African Highveld. Composite samples were taken from the top 20 cm of soils (Plinthustalfs) that have been cropped for lengths of time varying from 0 to 98 years in each of three different agro-ecosystems in the Free State Province of South Africa. Thereafter, soil organic C and N concentrations were determined in the bulk soil (< 2 mm) as well as in the clay (< 2 mum), silt (2-20 mum), fine sand (20-250 mum), and coarse sand (250-2000 mum) separates. Long-term cultivation of native grassland reduced soil C and N concentrations by 65 and 55%, respectively. Losses of soil organic matter occurred from all particle-size separates, although rate loss constants increased as particle size increased. The concentrations of organic C reached equilibrium after 34 years for the bulk soil and after 55 years for clay-size separates. Nevertheless, organic matter attached to silt continued to be lost as the cropping continued, probably due to wind erosion. Changes in soil properties thereby continued even after almost 100 years of cultivation.

Moench] field experiment in which CO2 [supplied using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology] was crossed factorially with an irrigation treatment, soil aggregate (1-2 mm) water stability increased in response to elevated CO2. Aggregate water stability was increased by 40% and 20% in response to CO2, at ample and limited water supply treatments, respectively. Soil hyphal lengths of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increased strongly (with a threefold increase in the dry treatment) in response to CO2, and the concentrations of one fraction (easily extractable glomalin, EEG) of the AMF-produced protein glomalin were also increased. Two fractions of glomalin, and AMF hyphal lengths were all positively correlated with soil aggregate water stability. The present results further support the hypothesis that AMF can become important in global change scenarios. Although in this field study a causal relationship between hyphal length, glomalin and aggregate stability cannot be demonstrated, the present data do suggest that AMF could mediate changes in soil structure under elevated CO2. This could be of great importance in agricultural systems threatened by erosional soil loss.

AB Landscape-scale approaches to research in soil science are explicitly focused on transfers of components within and between landscapes. Despite wide-spread recognition of the importance of these transfers, the application of landscape-scale approaches has been hindered by the lack of clear, reproducible research designs. Landform segmentation is used to divide natural and human-influenced landscapes into functionally distinct units. A specific type of landform segmentation, landform element classification, was used in a comparative mensurative design to compare the effects of cultivation on soil distribution and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and in a manipulative design to determine the relationship between N2O emissions and fertilizer rate in a hummocky till geomorphic surface in southern Saskatchewan. Significant transfers of SOC and surface soil from convex shoulder units to lower slope positions occurred over the past 90 years, resulting in a change in the type of soils that occupy these positions at two research sites. The observed pattern is consistent with a tillage translocation dominated surface. The dominant control on N2O emissions in the landscape are spatial differences in water-filled pore space (WFPS) that are strongly controlled by water redistribution. Emissions from drier, shoulder landform element complexes are consistently low throughout the year, whereas a strong positive relationship between N fertilizer rate and N2O emissions occur in the wettest, level depressional elements.

AB Field studies on soil properties and processes in southern Saskatchewan have clearly indicated the need to account for both lateral and vertical transfers of components in the landscape for a better understanding of soil dynamics at a given point. Extrapolation of these studies requires greater integration of the site-specific field results with the current generation of process models. In this paper, we use the results of a field study to assess the ability of the CENTURY model to describe the influence of soil redistribution on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. After modifying the erosion input of CENTURY to account for soil deposition, the results from CENTURY were compared to measured SOC levels from a chronosequential study of cultivation effects on SOC levels in southern Saskatchewan. CENTURY closely simulated the effects of soil loss on SOC levels in landform segments with dominantly convex profile (i.e., downslope) curvature. CENTURY estimates of SOC changes for landform segments experiencing soil gain are less comparable to the field results; it overestimated SOC loss after 80 years by 16 Mg ha(-1) for depressional complexes and 10 Mg ha(-1) for footslope complexes. This leads to a 14% difference in total SOC loss on a landscape-weighted basis (estimated loss based on field data of 36 Mg ha(-1) versus a CENTURY-simulated loss of 41 Mg ha(-1)).

AB The reclamation of burned soils in Mediterranean environments is of paramount importance in order to increase the levels of soil protection and minimise erosion and soil loss. The changes produced in the content of total organic carbon (TOC), N (Kjeldahl) and available P, K, Ca and Mg by the addition of different doses of a municipal solid waste compost to a burned soil were evaluated during one year. The effect of organic amendment on the improvement in the vegetation cover after one year was also evaluated. The organic amendment, particularly at a high dose, increased the TOC and N-Kjeldahl content of the soil in a closely related way. The levels of available K in soil were also enhanced by the organic amendment. Although the effects on all three parameters tended to decrease with time. their values in the amended soils were higher than in the control soil, which clearly indicates the improvement in the chemical quality of the soil brought about by the organic amendment. The available P content did not seem to be influenced by organic treatment, while available Mg levels were higher than in the control during the first 4 months following organic amendment. The application of compost to the burned soil improved its fertility and favoured rapid vegetal recovery, thus minimising the risk of soil erosion. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Concern about the global increase in atmospheric CO2 has focussed attention on C sequestration in soil and the influence of management practices on soil organic C (OC) stocks. Evaluation of management practices is required at scales comparable to farm management units, which encompass heterogeneous soils and different landforms. The objectives of this study were to describe the spatial dependence of soil OC mass in two adjacent fields with contrasting tillage practices on Black Chernozemic soils using geostatistics and relate it to topographic features and soil series. Mass of OC was measured for a surface layer, the A horizon and solum. The spatial dependence of OC mass was at a scale commensurate with topographic variation. Spatial analysis generally corroborated description of the sampling site by soil series. which represented differences in drainage as influenced by slope-position acid redistribution of water across the landscape. Soil series alone or grouped by drainage class, therefore, provided a framework by which to stratify the site for evaluation of effects of tillage practice on OC mass and extrapolation of results to comparable sites within the same landscape.

ID GROWTH
AB High population density and intensive use of land in Flanders (Northern Belgium) have resulted in a shortage of land to dump dredged sediments. In search of an area efficient solution, a mound was constructed and afforested; 50-114% more dredged sediment per unit area could be discarded by constructing mounds with a height of 6.6 m compared to conventional disposal sites. To prevent erosion, the mound was afforested. Preliminary results of tree growth and changes in soil conditions are demonstrated. Tree survival and height growth are highest in the dominant wind direction sc. the SW-NE axis. On the slopes, parallel with the dominant wind direction, tree mortality up to 80% was observed. The increase of the soil organic carbon content from 3.1 to 3.8% could be partly put down to the growth of tree roots. This increase in organic carbon has far-reaching consequences for potential soil sanitation. The high amount of CaCO3 in the soil protects the mound from internal or external acidification for the next centuries. After four growing seasons, electric conductivity was reduced to the threshold for salt sensitive plants. (C) 2001 Elsevier science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sedimentary core BDP-93-2, Lake Baikal, southeast Siberia, provides a high-resolution record of the interval corresponding to marine oxygen isotope stage 3 (MIS 3). Sharp drops in fossil diatom abundance suggest the occurrence of short-term cooling episodes in Lake Baikal area during this time interval. AMS radiocarbon dates on core BDP-93-2 constrain the age of the upper three episodes (younger than 24 ka BP, younger than 30.5 ka BP, older than 34 ka BP) and therefore permit correlation of the Baikal diatom abundance record with records of iceberg discharge (Heinrich) events in the North Atlantic. Lithology of BDP-93-2 at the Selenga Delta indicates that cooling episodes are also associated with deposition of distinct layers of brownish mud enriched in terrestrial organic carbon. Thus, two types of signals associated with Heinrich events and Bond cooling cycles are observed in the sedimentary record from Lake Baikal. The lacustrine response to cooling episodes includes basin-wide decreases in diatom production, and the response of the catchment basin includes erosion of soils. These episodes of erosion, herein recognized as "Kuzmin events", are likely related to dramatic changes in atmospheric precipitation regime that impacted the semi-arid provinces of Lake Baikal watershed over the short periods of time represented by these events.

AB Agricultural management affects soil and soil organic carbon (SOC) erosion. The effect was assessed for a watershed (0.79 ha, 10% slope steepness, 132 m slope length) at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed research station near Coshocton, Ohio, from 1951 to 1998, The agricultural management included: (i) plow-till corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L,)-meadow-meadow rotation (CWMM) from 1951 to 1970, (ii) plow-till continuous corn (CC) from 1971 to 1975, (iii) meadow (M) from 1976 to 1983, and (iv) no till corn-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) rotation (CS) from 1984 to 1998, Soil erosion was assessed by sediment collection, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and the (137)Cesium (Cs-137) method. The SOC erosion was computed as a product of the soil erosion multiplied by the SOC content of 1.51% in the surface soil and by the SOC enrichment ratio of 1.71 except for the proportional equation of the Cs-137 method. Sediment collection measurements indicated that the annual soil and SOC erosion rates (Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) for the corn cycles were, respectively, 1.55 and 0.040 for CWMM, 5.88 and 0.15 for CC, 0.63 and 0.016 for CS, and 2.34 and 0.060 for the entire period. The rates were, respectively, 0.35 and 0.009 for wheat cycles, 0.63 and 0.016 for soybean cycles, and essentially zero for meadow. Furthermore, the rates for the crop rotation periods were, respectively, 0.50 and 0.013 for CWMM, 5.88 and 0.15 for CC, 0.63 and 0.016 for CS, and 1.02 and 0.026 for the entire study period. The estimates by the RUSLE and proportional equation were 3 to 14 and 10 to 55 times the sediment values, respectively. However, the estimates by the revised exponential equation were 1 to 3 times the sediment values.

AB Conservation tillage systems such as no-till with winter rye cover cropping change soil chemical properties, which affect crop growth and the environment. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of no-till and mulch-till systems, surface application of poultry litter, and winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop on soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), and N and P concentrations in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plots. The study was done on a Decatur silt loam in north Alabama from 1996 to 1998. SOM under no-till and mulch-till systems in the 0-15 cm soil depth in November 1998 was 22 g kg(-1) (P < 0.05) compared with 15 g kg(-1) in November 1996. A similar result was obtained with winter rye cover cropping compared with cotton-winter Fallow system. Surface application of poultry litter at 100 or 200 kg N ha(-1) increased SOM by 55-80%. In the 200 kg N ha(-1) poultry litter treatment, NH4 in the 30-90 cm soil depth in November 1998 was 22% higher than that in November 1996. Compared with the ammonium nitrate, the poultry litter treatment plots had up to 40% more NO3 in the 0-30 cm soil depth after the first year of study. Extractable P and soil pH at the end of the study were similar to those at the beginning. This study shows that no-till and mulch-till, winter rye cover cropping, and surface application of poultry litter in cotton production systems can rapidly increase surface SOM. The increase in SOM was attributed to less biological oxidation of crop residues and from soil C contributed by poultry litter. Crop uptake of N and P prevented a significant build up of these nutrient. These results are important to production systems in the US cotton belt where soil productivity is threatened by erosion because of low SOM levels and the safe disposal of poultry litter is becoming a major environmental problem, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Human activities have had pronounced impacts on soil properties. Conifer afforestation in the uplands has caused significant decreases in soil pH and in the quality and turnover of organic matter. Acid deposition has increased soil acidity by a similar amount to conifer afforestation but has been shown to affect soils at greater depths. Acid deposition has also increased the mobility of trace metals in the soil and therefore increased metal concentrations in drainage waters. Applications of sewage sludge to the soil have been shown to increase metal concentrations, although most of the Scottish soils affected have high trace metal binding capacities. Intensification of arable cultivation in the lowlands has reduced organic matter concentrations, structural stability and soil workability, and has had effects on soil erodibility. Human trampling, while highly localised, affects sensitive mountain soils in popular areas, leading to loss of surface organic horizons, and therefore, carbon storage. The future impacts of human activities on the soil may be exacerbated by changing climate, and the need to monitor and predict these will not diminish. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Scantly available knowledge of organic mulch decomposition kinetics is important to determine the best choice of mulching materials, and their application rate and frequency for crop production and soil protection in arid areas. The kinetics was studied in two field experiments. In Experiment I, it was tested for sugarcane trash mulch (6 Mg ha(-1)) with and without enriching it with Mussoorie rock phosphate (MRP) at 600 kg ha(-1) (obtained from Mls pyrites, Phosphates and Chemicals Ltd., Dehradun, India) and with industrial glue waste (GW) at 4 Mg ha(-1), a solid granular waste material of subcutaneous animal origin, rich in N (obtained from Glue Industry, Juglan, Haryana, India) at ratoon sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) on fine loamy soil for two years (1997-1998 and 1998-1999) at Hisar (29 degrees 05 'N, 75 degrees 38 'E, 222 m elevation). The GW and MRP were manually broadcast over the sugarcane trash mulch at the time of mulch application. Experiment II was conducted from December 1998 to April 1999 on sandy soil at Balsamand (29 degrees 07 'N, 75 degrees 28 'E, 225 m elevation), 35 km west of Hisar, at bare field conditions wherein three different types of mulches were tested: farmyard manure (FM), green neem (Azadiracta indica) leaves GM, and wheat straw (Triticum. aestivum) (WM), with two mulch thicknesses (20 and 40 mm). Wheat straw mulch (WM) placed at surface was compared with wheat straw mixed into 0.0-0.10 m soil depth (W-mixed) for decomposition kinetics. The loss in dry weight of mulches was taken as a measure for mulch decomposition as a function of time (t). First-order decomposition kinetics was followed in all the treatments at varying field moisture conditions in Experiments I and II. The decomposition percentage in 4 months (d4) was 40% higher at enriched sugarcane trash (ESM) than that at sugarcane trash mulch (SM). It was higher at 20 mm mulch thickness than at 40 mm for all the types of mulch in Experiment II and followed the order GM > WM > FM. The d4 value of W-mixed was two times higher than that of wheat straw mulch WM at 20 mm mulch thickness. Mulch decomposition rate constant k was 0.0071 d(-1) for SM and 0.0115 d(-1)for ESM averaged over the two years. The k values were 0.0021 d(-1), 0.0032 d(-1), and 0.0037 d(-1) for FM, WM, and GM respectively at 20 mm mulch thickness and it was 0.0066 d(-1) for W-mixed in Experiment II. The practical implications were: (a) enriched dry mulch should be preferred over dry mulch for annual crops in order to enhance their nutrient recycling and decomposition, and (b) dry mulch should be preferred over green mulch in the perennial fruit trees for their long persistence and durability in order to protect soils against wind erosion in and areas.

AB Amino acids and proteins typically form the biggest input of organic-N into most soils and provide a readily available source of C and N for soil microorganisms. Amino acids can also be taken up directly by plant roots, providing an alternative source of available soil N. However, the degree to which plants can compete against the soil microbial population for amino acids in soil solution remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to measure the rate of microbial uptake of three contrastingly charged C-14-labelled amino acids (glutamate(1-), glycine(0), lysine(0.9+)) over a wide concentration range (0.1-5 mM) and in two contrastingly managed soils varying in their degree of erosion, organic-C content and microbial biomass. Amino acid uptake was concentration dependent and conformed to a single Michaelis-Menten equation. The mean maximum amino acid uptake rate (V-max) for the non-eroded (control) soil thigh organic-C, high biomass) was 0.13+/-0.02 mmol kg(-1) h(-1) while half maximal uptake occurred at a concentration (K-m) of 2.63+/-0.07 mM. Typically, V-max was fourfold lower and K-m twofold lower in the eroded soil (low available organic-C, low biomass) compared to the non-eroded (control) soil. Amino acid substrate concentration had little effect on the proportion of amino acid utilized in catabolic versus anabolic metabolism and was similar for both. While the results obtained here represent the summation of kinetics for a mixed soil population, they indicate that amino acid uptake is saturated at concentrations within the millimolar range. Because the affinity constants also were similar to those described for plant roots, we hypothesized that competition for amino acids between plants and microbes will be strong in soil but highly dependent upon the spatial distribution of roots and microbes in soil.

AB Environmental proxies of soil erosion on Iceland, and oceanographic conditions on the adjacent shelf, were measured on a 50 cm box core taken from the southwest Iceland shelf in 1993 during cruise 93030 of the Canadian ship, CSS Hudson. These data, covering the last several centuries, are compared with the documentary record of sea-ice changes around Iceland since A.D. 1600. The site is under the influence of The Irminger Current, which carries warm, saline, Atlantic water northward along the shelf. Because of the relative warmth of this current, sea ice rarely occurs off southwest Iceland, even during the most severe sea-ice intervals of the historical record. In severe sea-ice years, however, the ice drifts clockwise around Iceland from the northeast and east and, in rare cases, reaches the southern coasts (Ogilvie, 1992). The chronology of the core was established by converting the basal radiocarbon date to calendar years and assuming a linear sedimentation rate from the base of the core to the year of collection, 1993. Organic carbon, stable C and O istotope ratios, planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, and sediment magnetic parameters were measured on samples from the core, plotted against calendar years and compared to the Icelandic sea-ice index. The environmental proxies suggest that increased soil erosion, reduced salinity, and, possibly, decreased marine productivity prevailed during the severe sea-ice interval lasting from the last quarter of the eighteenth century to around 1920. Such a situation could develop with climatic cooling, increased storminess, and toss of vegetation cover to stabilise the soil. Although the core site generally lies outside the sea-ice limits, the evidence clearly shows the influence of sea ice and fresh water, and is sensitive to the overall climatic deterioration manifested by the sea-ice record.

AB The area of study is located in the centre of the Murcia region, in Southeast Spain, under a semiarid Mediterranean climate. These soils are subject to an eminently agricultural use (60 %). The main uses correspond to marginal degraded areas, unirrigated tree cultures, irrigated cultures (trees and horticultural varieties), orchard cultures, soil prepared for cultivation and uncultivated soil with unaltered vegetation. As field parameters the following have been considered: type of soil, use, depth, water erosion, drainage and structure. Chemical parameters referring to organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, carbon/nitrogen ratio and soil salinity have also been determined. Systematic sampling of every km(2) was carried out taking 30 cm. deep samples from the soil surface. A total of 42 samples were obtained. The field parameters indicate that this is an area where a greatly effective soil depth predominates. The most significant symptoms of physical degradation are surface sealing and sheet rill and gully water erosion, especially in Calcaric Regosols set for unirrigated and irrigated tree cultures. These soils usually show lack of structure and heavy drainage. As for analytic data, the predominance of low or very low contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen is stressed, particularly in Regosols. These contents increase slightly in soils set for irrigation cultures, giving rise to low CIN ratios. Although most soils are not (or just slightly) affected by salinity, the most significant values are also observed in irrigated cultures, where the original material may contribute these salts. The results obtained reveal, as shown on the cartographic study, that inadequate management negatively influences soil quality; because of which soil evaluation prior to land management is rendered essential.

AB Under dry Mediterranean climate, the vegetation recovery of hillslopes with old abandoned unirrigated fields, leads to a landscape in mosaic (i.e. areas with and without vegetation), as consequence of the continuous structural degradation of the soil caused by water erosion and wildfires. To model this relationship, indexes of structural stability in water of a forest soil classified as Rendzic Leptosol have been investigated in representative soil samples of La Concordia (Valencia, Spain) in areas with and without vegetation.
   In the laboratory, samples were subjected to simulated action of water erosion, sedimentation, wetting-drying processes, and to different heat-induced intensity.
   For both the soil under plants and the bare soil all the simulated processes modified the original contents of carbonates and organic matter. The smallest values of organic matter and the highest of carbonates were obtained in the remoulded soil samples constituted by sand-size macroaggregates. For the two radiation intensities, the simulated heating action caused a decrease of the organic matter content and an increase of the carbonates content. The maximum intensity of heat caused an increment of the relative transient and stationary stability indexes. In the soil under vegetation heat affected mainly the sand-size macroaggregates whereas in the bare soil affected the silt-size microaggregates.
   The results obtained through the simulated processes in the laboratory allow one to go deeper into the complex nature of soils and degradation processes in the Mediterranean areas, are useful for modelling them and for the understanding of each individual process.

AB Restoration of degraded soils with organic wastes could be a feasible practice to minimise erosion in the Mediterranean area. In this work we have applied three different organic wastes to three different soils of degraded areas. Two composted and one uncomposted sewage sludges were used for the restoration of soils. The soils were: one soil of overexploited agricultural area, one burned forest soil, and one shrub-land soil degraded by environmental conditions (annual rainfall similar to 300 mm) and erosion. The experiment was carried out in field conditions. After the addition of organic amendments, some soil samplings were made. Different soil properties were determined: physical (aggregate stability %), chemical (pH, salinity, available nutrients) and biological, (microbial biomass carbon, soil respiration rate). Beneficial and detrimental results have been obtained in the earliest stages (around three months after organic application) of this long-term restoration experiment. In the first 90 days after wastes application one of the positive effects in the shrub-land soil has been the increase of around 1.7-fold in soil microbial biomass carbon with respect to untreated soils. But, in some treated soils negative effects have been observed too, such as an increase in electrical conductivity. This negative effect is reversible and temporary, and may disappear after rainfalls. Therefore, the application of the different organic wastes to degraded soils could be a good restoration management.

AB The objective of this study was to compare and determine changes in some soil properties after 27 years. For comparison were used data published by Hrasko (1970), within the frame of MAB UNESCO Programme. Experimental plot was located in Bab forest declared in 1966 as a National Nature Reserve. We found out, that during 27 years content of soil organic carbon was a little changed, increased in top layer and decreased in depth 0.5-0.6 in, more intensively this changes were in colluvial foot slope than upland site. In topsoil of upland forest position the values of soil reaction slightly increased, more expressive differences were observed in Bt - luvic horizon. In the site on the colluvial foot slope the values of soil reaction slightly decreased in the whole soil profile. Generally, values of soil reaction and content of carbonates in subsoil were similar like those determined in year 1970. On the basis of determined values characterizing compared soil profiles we note, that evidence by Hrasko ( 1970) stated of colic accumulation on colluvial foot slope site is lesser than in 70 years. This is important result of continuing acidification and erosion processes.

AB Soil carbon is a major determinant of sustainability of agricultural systems and changes can occur in both total and active or labile C pools. The measurements of soil organic matter (SOM) changes under various forms of land use are needed for the development of sustainable systems. Soil organic matter quality was assessed by HA:FA ratios determined by two fractional methods (Tyurin's in modification Ponomareva-Plotnikova and by Kononova-Belchikova method) and by the calculation of Carbon Pool Index (CPI) and Lability Index (LI), these were used to calculate a Carbon Management Index (CMI). These parameters were determined and assessed in arable soil (two sites - on upland and colluvial foot slope) and in forest soil (National Nature Reserve) in locality Bab. Analyses of paired samples (cropped and uncropped soil) have shown high difference in total and labile carbon content, and in quality of SOM caused by intensive cultivation. We observed a decline in CPI as influence of erosion processes and cultivation, a greater decline in LI and hence a decline in CMI. Labile carbon and the CMI can be used effectively to monitor the rate of change in soil carbon.

AB Tillage and fallow have been suggested as management options for converting Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) areas to cropland This study was conducted to measure selected soil quality characteristics of former CRP sites in Mississippi, Nebraska, and South Dakota that were tilled and then left fallow for 21 or 22 months. Soil samples from depth intervals of 0-7.6 cm and 0-30.5 cm were collected for laboratory assessment of the following soil quality indicators: bulk density, EC, pH, total C, organic C, total N NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, biomass C, biomass N, anaerobic NH4-N, lab respiration 0-10 days and lab respiration 10-20 days. When compared to undisturbed CRP, increased NO3-N values on the tillage and fallow plots suggest that under the extreme renditions employed in this study, organic residues were being mineralized. Re a result, significant reductions in organic C and total N were found at the 0-7.6 cm depth on each of the fallow plots. Thus, to reduce soil quality degradation, use of minimum-till or no-till management systems may be best suited for CRP areas which are converted to cropland.

AB Trace metals in the four discrete layers of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (Fiskeler) at Stevns Klint (Denmark) are relatively well studied, yet much remains to be learned about them. Therefore, an integrated study of the trace (meteoritic Ir, partly meteoritic Cr/Ni/Co/Au and terrestrial Zn/Cu/La/Ce/Nd/Sm/Eu/Tb/Yb/Ta/Th) metals in the basal black marl of Fiskeler and in its (carbonate, HCl-soluble, smectite, HCl-insoluble, silicate and kerogen) fractions was undertaken. The mineralogy of the marl is comparatively simple, authigenic calcite (mainly derived from planktonic marine algae: coccoliths), detrital Mg-smectite and quartz being the principal components, with lesser amounts of kerogen, Fe3+-oxides, pyrite, ilite and feldspar. Selective leaching procedures were used to establish geochemical associations and specific mineralogical locations of the trace metals. The results identified the main locations of the major trace metals (Cr/Ni/Co/Zn/Cu/Au), They occur mainly in the smectite and, to a lesser extent, in the biogenic calcite (Ni/Co/Zn) and kerogen (Ir/Au). The trace metal data are in accordance with the hypothesis that substantial proportions of Cr/Ni/Co/Zn/Cu/Ir/Au were probably contained in the detrital smectite arriving at the site of the deposition. In a general discussion of the results, a geochemical model describing the incorporation of trace metals in the smectite is presented, based on the weathering/trasport of the clay by (impact-induced) acid surface waters and the adsorption of trace metal ions by the smectite particles/colloids in the acidic solution of nearby oxic soil. The distribution/enrichment patterns of Cr/Ni/Co/Zn of the basal black marl and higher Fiskeler layers indicate, on the other hand, that notable proportions of these metals were incorporated into the smectite structure during the formation of the clay. The trace metal data are also considered in light of previously published paleoecological and geochemical information for Fiskeler. It is proposed, for example, that the local (impact-induced) superacid rainfall and wildfires played an important role in providing appropriate humics (i.e. appropriate organics of decaying land green plants) having porphyrin stuctures for the formation of kerogen (enriched with Cu2+-porphyrins). In addition, it has been suggested that the biogenic calcite with high Ni is probably a product of the metabolic uptake of boundary seawater (enriched with this metal) by the coccoliths. The metal enrichment of the seawater was created by a sudden and high influx of (apparently mainly meteoritic) Ni: airborne and laterally redeposited (by the acid surface/river waters) from a nearby soil. Lastly, the lateral distribution of kerogen (enriched with Cu2+-porpyhyrins) supports an earlier interpretation presented by Hultenberg(1,2) that the alleged (Nye Klov/Dania) boundaries in northwestern Denmark represent erosion and subsequent redeposition of Fiskeler in eastern Denmark.

AB Tropical forests of the world are degrading at an alarming rate because of human-induced activities. This study was conducted to determine the consequences of deforestation on the natural regeneration of vegetation and soil quality in tropical, semi-evergreen protected and degraded forest ecosystems of Bangladesh. In each forest ecosystem, 20 matured trees were randomly selected for laid-out experimental pints by placing the tree stand at the center of the plot. The number of vegetative species, height, basal area, crown percentages and species richness were measured. The selected soil properties were determined. The vegetation in the protected forest site was denser with an abundance of species than in the degraded forest site. The primary forest regenerative species were dominated by the dipterocarps in both forest sites. The most alarming difference was that of an abrupt decline in regenerative forest species accompanied by an increase in exotic shrubs, grasses and vines typical of open habitats in the degraded forest site. These shrubs (e.g. Melastaoma, Lantana camara, Clerodendrum infortunatum and Jasminium spp.) and grasses and vines (e.g. Imperata cylindrica, Imperata arundinacea, Mikania scandenes, Saccharum spontaneum and Eupatorium odoratum) are gradually replacing the primary forest regenerative species in the degraded forest site. The soil quality of the degraded forest site has deteriorated over time due to preferential removal of finer particles and organic matter by accelerated water erosion. As a result, natural regeneration of primary forest species, especially dipterocarps, is severely affected by the direct effects of biotic interferences and attendant processes of soil quality degradation from deforestation. In contrast, degraded forest sites under regular protection have shown slow, but gradual, increase in crown frequency, enhanced recruitment and recovery of primary forest species, species abundance, and an improvement in soil quality.

AB Some general notions on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and the difficulties to evaluate this process globally are presented. Problems of time- and space- scales are emphasized. SOC erosion, which is generally difficult to evaluate in relation to land use changes, is discussed in detail. Different aspects of SOC sequestration on the Lesser Antilles are presented for a wide range of soil types. Comparisons between soils revealed that the SOC stocks in the Lesser Antilles are highly dependent upon the mineralogy: higher stocks for allophanic (ALL) soils than for low activity clay (LAC) and high activity clay (HAC) soils. But in terms of potential of SOC sequestration (pSeq-SOC, differences between permanent vegetation and continuous cultivation situations), there are no differences between ALL and LAC soils (22.9 and 23.3 tC. ha(-1), respectively). On the other hand, the potentials of SOC sequestration were higher for HAC soils (30.8 - 59.4 tC. ha(-1), with the higher levels in the less Mg- and Na-affected Vertisol). Sheet erosion is a serious problem for Vertisol with high Mg and Na on exchange complex, causing high dispersability of fine elements. Thus, the lower SOC levels in these soils may be partly due to erosion losses. Laboratory incubations have shown that 37 - 53% of the protected SOC in these soils was located in aggregates larger than 0.2 mm. The effect of agricultural practices on SOC sequestration was studied for the Vertisols. Intensification of pastures led to higher plant productivity and higher organic matter restitutions and SOC sequestration. The gain was 53.5 and 25.4 tC. ha(-1) for the low and high-Mg Vertisol, respectively (0-20 cm layer). SOC sequestration with pastures also depends upon the plot history with lower mean annual increase in SOC for the initially eroded (1.0 gC . kg(-1) soil . yr(-1)) than for the non-degraded (1.5 gC . kg(-1) soil . yr(-1)) Vertisol. Loss of SOC in a pasture-market gardening rotation was 22.2 tC . ha(-1) with deep (30-40 cm) and 10.7 tC . ha(-1) with surface (10-15 cm) tillage. It was unclear whether the differences in SOC losses were due to mineralization and/or to erosion.

AB Soil organic matter plays a major role in sustainable agricultural development in Vietnam. A general soil evaluation shows that the content of organic matter in most soil units in Vietnam ranges between 0.5 to 3.0% soil organic matter (in the A and B horizon only) with lower levels especially on sloping land. Most upland soils (70% that contain less than or equal to 2% soil organic matter) are in danger due to imminent soil erosion. Soil organic matter is lost very quickly due to erosion, lack of organic manure and poor farming techniques in these areas. Using green hedgerows along contour lines and intercropping with legume species to cover the soil are technological options to control soil erosion and improve soil organic matter content on sloping land. Green hedgerows significantly reduce soil and organic matter loss by 50-70%, compared to sloping land without hedgerows. Intercropping with legume species reduces soil loss by 40-50%, and can provide the soil with 2.5-12 tons of green manure/ha/year. However, more studies are needed to identify the best technologies for managing soil organic matter in upland areas.

AB Judged by their negative nutrient balances, low soil cover and low productivity, the predominant agro-pastoral farming systems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa are highly unsustainable for crop production intensification. With kaolinite as the main clay type, the cation exchange capacity of the soils in this region, often less than 1 cmol(c) kg(-1)soil, depends heavily on the organic carbon (Corg) content. However, due to low carbon sequestration and to the microbe, termite and temperature-induced rapid turnover rates of organic material in the present land-use systems, Corg contents of the topsoil are very low, ranging between 1 and 8 g kg(-1) in most soils. For sustainable food production, the availability of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) has to be increased considerably in combination with an improvement in soil physical properties. Therefore, the adoption of innovative management options that help to stop or even reverse the decline in Corg typically observed after cultivating bush or rangeland is of utmost importance. To maintain food production for a rapidly growing population, targeted applications of mineral fertilisers and the effective recycling of organic amendments as crop residues and manure are essential. Any increase in soil cover has large effects in reducing topsoil erosion by wind and water and favours the accumulation of wind-blown dust high in bases which in turn improves P availability. In the future decision support systems, based on GIS, modelling and simulation should be used to combine (i) available fertiliser response data from on-station and on-farm research, (ii) results on soil productivity restoration with the application of mineral and organic amendments and (iii) our present understanding of the cause-effect relationships governing the prevailing soil degradation processes. This will help to predict the effectiveness of regionally differentiated soil fertility management approaches to maintain or even increase soil Corg levels.

AB Soil fertility is closely linked to soil organic matter (SOM), whose status depends on input, i.e., mainly biomass management, and output, i.e., mineralization, erosion and leaching. Preliminary results from runoff plots and lysimeters on hillslopes in West Africa indicated that carbon losses by erosion and leaching ranged between 10 and 100 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), depending on annual rainfall and vegetal cover. Under natural conditions, losses may be low enough to be compensated by aerial deposits. But together with mineralization, erosion can locally be an important cause of SOM decrease in cropping systems where there is poor soil cover, steep slopes and erosive rain conditions. The effect of previous erosion on cereal production was assessed in case studies from Rwanda, Burundi, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso. On the densely populated hillslopes of Rwanda, hedges and manure reduced runoff and erosion efficiently, but did not succeed in improving grain yields due to P-deficiency of these ferrallitic soils. In Burundi, under similar conditions but under banana plantation, tree density and mulch cover had a strong influence on erosion; this previous erosion had an important effect on the next maize yield, even when the soils were amended with manure, mineral fertilizers and lime. On sandy ferruginous soils of North Cameroon, erosion increased with increasing tillage intensity. Manure application increased grain yield, but burying organic residues did not improve SOM levels and soil resistance to erosion. Mulching and tillage limited to the plant rows protected the topsoil against erosion, but did not clearly increase the yield. Manuring permitted the restoration of soil productivity, but additional mineral fertilizers (P, N) were needed to reach rapidly a high level of grain production. In the same way, experiments conducted with traditional Zai system for restoring a degraded Entisol in Burkina Faso showed that runoff harvesting and organic matter input were not sufficient with no additional N and P fertilizers. Complementary experiments in Cameroon showed that a 4-mm selective sheet erosion and a 50-mm non-selective de-surfacing resulted in similar yield decline. Long fallowing, burning and grazing are traditional ways to utilize available biomass in Africa. Considering social habits and technical realities, it seems useful to balance `grazing-manuring' and mulching in order to protect the soil and maintain its productive capacity. Minimum tillage with mulch (crop residues, weeds or legume fallow) is the new trend used for increasing crop production, with the help of herbicides. Agroforestry that produces good-quality litter is also a part of the solution.

AB The goal of this paper is to put the issue of preserving Soil Organic Matter (SOM) into a regional, urban-rural, context. In doing so, we apply the method of material flux analysis to a watershed in Boyaca in Colombia. We estimate the order of magnitude of the dry organic matter and carbon fluxes between the rural and urban parts of the region, including estimates on biomass growth, tillage, organic waste, and sewage. These estimates are used to derive potentials for carbon cycling between rural and urban areas. It is shown that (i) for the municipality of Tunja, the treated organic wastes produced in the urban area could add about 30% to the current carbon input into arable soils; (ii) to preserve the organic carbon content in soils in Tunja over the long-term, either, erosion control measures have to be implemented and/or the total treated urban organic wastes have to be concentrated on about 1/5 of the agricultural area. However, such an attempt has to consider the possible trade off between allocation needs (poor farmers on the hillside) and allocation costs (transportation and distribution costs).

AB We discuss paleoenvironmental changes at the Dae-Am San high moor, located near the Demilitarized Zone at 38degreesN. This area has been reported to be the only high moor in the Korean peninsula. The C-14 age of the bottom sediment (75-80 cm in depth) at this site is about 1900 BP. Since the radiocarbon ages for the intervals at 50-55 cm and 75-80 cm were almost the same, we conclude that the deep layers (55-80 cm) in the high moor were all part of the original soil. Low organic C and N contents in the deeper layers support this inference. The 50-55-cm layer consists of sandy material with very low organic content, suggesting erosion from the surrounding area. The surface layer (0-5 cm) was measured as 190 BP, and the middle layer (30-35 cm) was 870 BP. The bulk sedimentation rate was estimated to be about 0.4 mm yr(-1) for the 0-30-cm interval. The delta(13)C value of organic carbon in the sediments fluctuated with depth. The delta(13)C profile of the Dae-Am San high moor may be explained by climatic changes which occurred during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period.

AB It is not widely recognized that agricultural soils can be a sink for atmospheric C. Whereas land misuse and soil mismanagement can make soil a source of CO2, CH4 and N2O, adoption of recommended agricultural practices can re-sequester C in soil making it a net sink. Agricultural practices that lead to emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from soil include conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, deforestation, biomass burning, indiscriminate use of fertilizers and manures, and excessive tillage. Emission of GHGs is exacerbated by soil degradation caused by accelerated erosion, acidification, salinization, and reduction in soil biodiversity. The historic loss of C from soil with attendant emission into the atmosphere is estimated at 66 to 90 Pg. In contrast; restoration of degraded soils and adoption of recommended agricultural practices can reverse the degradative trends and make world soils a net sink for atmospheric C. Soil C sequestration, removal of C from atmosphere via photosynthesis and its storage in soil as humus, is achieved through: (i) restoration of degraded soils, (ii) conversion of agriculturally marginal lands into restorative land uses, and (iii) management of prime soils with the recommended agricultural practices. The potential of soil C sequestration through such measures may be 50 to 70 Pg over a 25- to 50-yr period. However, the realization of this vast potential of agricultural soils for C sequestration depends on replacement of popular myths by facts through improvements in the knowledge base and strengthening of the data bank on soil properties at the pedon level.

AB Future emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere are expected to continue to increase and, along with other "greenhouse gases", contribute to the potential for global climate warming. Capture of atmospheric CO2-C by photosynthesis and its subsequent sequestration in soil is likely the best long-term option for C storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Adverse impacts of ongoing soil erosion in the USA resulted in legislative authority to implement the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The CRP returns cultivated land to permanent plant cover and that potentially increases the atmospheric CO2-C captured through photosynthesis and its storage as soil organic C (SOC). This study evaluates that potential. Sampling sites were selected across three soil temperature and three soil moisture regimes found in the "historic grasslands" region of the USA. The sites had been in the CRP for a minimum of 5 yr and were paired with cropped sites that were as similar as possible. Weights of SOC and identifiable plant material (IPM) by soil layer to a depth of about 2 m were calculated using thicknesses, bulk densities, and C analyses data. Estimates of annual rates of SOC sequestration by the CRP and differences in total amounts of IPM were made by subtracting the amount measured in cropland sites from that measured under their paired CRP sites. Our estimates across the 13-state region in this study are that the CRP sequesters about 570, 740, and 910 kg SOC ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 0- to 5-, 0- to 10-, and 0- to 20-cm depth increments, respectively. A significant difference of the SOC and IPM under the CRP and cropped sites was observed at only these depth increments. The IPM likely precedes the introduction of and provides the C for SOC sequestration. Average amount of IPM-C under the CRP was 2990, 3470, and 3930 kg C hat greater than under the cropped sites. Total amounts of SOC sequestered by the CRP for the entire 5.6 million ha of land under the CRP within the soil temperature (T) x soil moisture (M) regimes included in this 13-state region are estimated as 3.19, 4.15, and 5.14 million metric tons of C (MMTC) yr(-1) within the 0- to 5-, 0- to 10-, and 0- to 20-cm depth increments, respectively.

AB Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems accelerates soil erosion that leads to depletion of the soil organic carbon (SOC) content of the surface layer. The increased loss of SOC occurs because it is concentrated in the surface layer, has low density and the labile particulate fraction is relatively unconsolidated. Removal by soil erosion may constitute half of the total loss of SOC pool from agricultural soils, the other half being due to an increase in mineralization caused by change in soil temperature and moisture regimes. The fate of eroded SOC is not clearly understood and depends on the specific stage of the erosional process. Aggregate breakdown by agents of erosion may enhance mineralization of the SOC thus exposed. As much as 20 to 80% of the SOC redistributed over the landscape may be susceptible to mineralization, leading to global emission of an estimated 1.14 Pg C yr(-1). Some of the particulate and dissolved organic C (POC and DOC) also may be easily mineralized. Yet, 0.57 to 1.0 Pg of C carried into the aquatic ecosystems may be sequestered annually. The fate of SOC buried in depositional sites depends on the degree of aggregation and anaerobiosis that it causes. While aggregation may suppress mineralization, the labile SOC pool may be mineralized and also be prone to methanogenesis. There is a strong need to strengthen the database and improve scientific knowledge about the fate of eroded SOC.

AB Wind erosion causes 6.1 billion t of soil loss on non-federal cultivated, pasture, and range land annually in the USA. Wind erosion can produce soil loss from valuable agronomic systems and fragile natural ecosystems that may have great economic impact. In addition to soil loss from valuable agronomic systems and fragile natural ecosystems, wind erosion is a significant source of fine dust that represents the most active portion of soil for plant growth. When this fine dust blows off fields, it often carries C of different forms. This carbonaceous portion of the soil material that is lost due to wind erosion is the most chemically active portion of the soil. A large body of literature deals with carbonaceous aerosols of anthropogenic and other non-soil related sources such as industry, combustion, and volatile organic materials released from vegetation and geological sources. In this chapter we will explore the processes of entrainment and transport as well as the forms, sources, transformations, and fate of soil-derived carbonaceous material in atmospheric particulates. The discussion includes structured, amorphous, and soluble organic C and inorganic C including elemental C, charcoal, and carbonate minerals.

AB Tea is a perennial crop grown on sloping terrain and high rainfall areas. It is the highest net foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. Though the soil under a perennial crop like tea is believed to be protected adequately by canopy and surface litter, there are occasions when the soil get exposed to varying degrees causing erosion and land degradation. Therefore, a study was undertaken to investigate the relation between land degradation and yield of tea. Land degradation was measured in terms of topsoil depth, organic matter, rainfall, nitrogen input and age of the tea. An empirical relation was established between tea yield, topsoil depth, organic carbon content of topsoil and other parameters. The results suggest that the tea yields have an inverse relationship up to 350 mm. The critical topsoil depth necessary for successful tea cultivation is about 200-250 mm. Organic carbon content of the top soil is also important in determining the tea yield.

AB Over winter flash floods cause erosive activities in the basins and adjacent agricultural areas in the semi-arid parts of the Negev Desert of Israel. This has led to the formation of waterfalls (gullies) that erode streams. Consequently, this has caused the loss of soil nutrients over time. Soil erosion in conjunction with human activities has greatly contributed to desertification in this part of the Negev. We set out to examine the effects of soil erosion and agricultural practices in seventeen eroded sites in northern Negev Desert. Organic carbon increased along a moisture gradient, being lowest in areas receiving 200 mm and highest where rainfall is over 300 nun per year. Nature reserves had higher organic carbon than cultivated areas. Salinity was highest in the nature reserve sites and irrigated areas because of accumulation of bases resulting from reduced leaching and continuous supplies of heavy metals from brackish water used in the irrigation system, respectively. Water holding capacity was higher in nature reserve soils than in cultivated areas, whereas eroded sites contained bigger soil particles than uneroded ones.

AB There are a number of basic, fundamental problems with the Use of Cs-137 as a marker for deriving soil erosion rates (see VandenBygaart et al., 1999a), However, this should not limit other potential uses of this anthropogenic radionuclide in the study of landscape soil processes. This study outlines a sampling methodology which allows for the assessment of the history of erosion and depositional processes within a landscape unit. We used the depth distribution of Cs-137 and soil organic carbon as a means of determining the erosion and depositional history of a conventionally-tilled agricultural field in southern Ontario, Canada. Three transects oriented along the slope of a large field each had 5 soil profiles excavated at the summit, sideslope, shoulder slope, footslope and toeslope, The soils were sampled in 5 cm increments and Cs-137 and soil organic carbon was determined on the samples. The results show that soil redistribution within landscape units of agricultural fields has been substantial both before and after fallout of Cs-137 to the soil surface. Soils in depositional areas contained significant Cs-137 and soil organic carbon at depths beyond which the plow can attain at present. This implies that the soil organic carbon beneath the present plow layer is being sequestered, Thus tillage practices may be modified to place organic residues at depths below the plow layer.

AB Interest in national carbon (C) budgets has increased following the signing of the Kyoto Protocol as countries begin to develop source/sink C inventories. In this study, specific-site measurements, regional databases, satellite observations, and models were used to test the hypothesis that New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems are C neutral because C uptake by planted forests and scrub is roughly balanced by C losses from indigenous forests and soils.
   Net ecosystem C balance was estimated from the difference between net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic soil respiration The productivity portion of the CASA model and NOAA-AVHRR imagery were used to estimate national NPP (128 +/- 14 Mt C per year). Main sources of uncertainty were the coarse spatial scale (1 x 1 km(2) grid cells), and the general lack of information on photosynthetically active radiation, light-use efficiency, and below-ground C allocation for the major vegetation types: indigenous and exotic forests, scrub, and grasslands (improved, unimproved and tussock). Total soil CO2-C production predicted from an Arrhenius-type function coupled to climate and land-cover data was 380 +/- 30 Mt C per year, suggesting that New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems may be either (a) a net source of atmospheric CO2 or (b) roughly in C balance if ca. 252 Mt CO2-C per year (66%) can be attributed to roots. Soil moisture limitations on respiration were small, reducing the national value to 365 +/- 28 Mt C per year. Differences between NPP and heterotrophic soil respiration were -29 Mt C per year for improved pastures, -8 Mt C per year for indigenous forests, and +4 Mt C per year for planted forests; the large negative value for improved grasslands may be due to under-estimation of NPP and root respiration. Soil C losses to coastal waters, as estimated from a consideration of all the major erosion processes, were ca. 3-11 Mt C per year.
   These national-scale estimates of ecosystem C balance were in general agreement with those based on plot-scale data for some major ecosystems including planted forests (4 hit C per year vs 3.7 Mt C per year, respectively) and indigenous forest (-8 Mt C per year vs ca. -2.8 Mt C per year, respectively). Poor agreement for forest regenerating after land abandonment (-17 hit C per year vs +3 hit C per year) was probably due to an underestimate of NPP at the national scale,
   Overall, the results suggest that New Zealand is a net C source, despite the fact that some ecosystems are accumulating C. For some land-use types, using the balance between NPP and soil respiration at the national scale to estimate the net ecosystem C balance may be too coarse, and studies of land-use changes at finer spatial scales are needed to reduce uncertainties in national-scale C balance estimates.

AB Sustainable use of natural resources continues to gain attention, especially in relation to energy and global carbon cycles. Biomass crops may offset fossil fuels and reduce CO2 contributions to greenhouse gases while improving soil and water quality. We review research on biomass crops, with emphasis on their specific characteristics and how their production can affect soil and water quality. Data from regions throughout the world are included, but the focus is primarily on recent research results from biomass crop production in the United States. Research to date shows promising short-term changes in soil and water quality, but responses vary. Short-term studies have demonstrated increases in surface soil organic-matter content, reduction in erosion and nutrient losses in surface runoff. We conclude that while the potential for benefits is present, data are not yet available to determine the long-term changes in soil quality associated with production of biomass crops.

AB Three sediment cores from the Laptev Sea continental margin were investigated for their clay mineralogy by X-ray diffraction to study the fluvial Pediment supply since the late Weichselian. In the study area, the clay-mineral composition of surface sediments is characterized by distinct regional variations. The source area for smectite in the eastern Eurasian Basin is the Putoran Plateau drained by the Khatanga and Yenisei rivers. Currents caused by river discharge and the inflow of Atlantic water masses along the Eurasian continental margin are responsible for sediment distribution. In the sediment cores, smectite and illite contents show an opposite trend which mainly results from variable smectite supply. During MIS 2 the amount of smectite on the Laptev Sea continental margin never exceeds 10 rel.%. Probably, reduced river discharge and the lowered sea level during MIS 2 caused a decreased sediment supply to the Laptev Sea. Additionally, the Putoran Plateau was covered by an ice sheet during the Late Weichselian preventing the erosion of smectite-rich soils. In contrast, maximum smectite contents (up to 30 rel.%) in Holocene sediments result from increased sediment input by the Khatanga River and from the Kara Sea through the Vilkitsky Strait and via St. Anna Trough into the western Laptev Sea.

AB Parametrizing soil reflectance spectra with variables related to specific shape characteristics of the spectral profile permits organic carbon concentrations in soils to be estimated on the basis of regionally validated regression models. An important feature of the approach is that it can not only be applied to continuous spectra but, without notable loss in accuracy, also to the spectral resolution of operational earth observation satellites such as the Landsat-TM or -ETM systems. Using this type of imagery, it can also be shown that soil organic matter is positively correlated to growth conditions for cereal crops in dryland agriculture. Strong correlations with qualitative erosion indicators that can be derived through spectral unmixing approaches demonstrate that soil organic matter is an important indicator for assessing land degradation processes in dry ecosystems from space.

AB Because of past major disturbances, the highly erodible,granitic soil in a Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica A. Murr. Var. shastensis) barrens located in McDonald basin on the north side of the Siskiyou Mountains crest is a major contributor of sediment to the aquatic system. Soil erosion is accelerated where vegetation is sparse and colonization slow, therefore, it is important that native plant cover be restored and the site rehabilitated. We examined soil properties that may be associated with vegetation patterns in the barrens and adjacent Shasta red fir forest and would have application to restoring native plant diversity and cover to the barrens. At a 40 ha study area we investigated plant available nutrients, soil C, microbial biomass, and enzymes involved in organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling in barrens and forest soils to determine if loss of the organic layer by erosion affected soil chemistry and microbiology. Twelve samples each were collected from 0 to 10 cm soil depth in forest and barrens and analyzed for C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, B, Zn, Mo, and Al; microbial biomass, and dehydrogenase, urease, and acid phosphatase activity. Soils supporting forest vegetation contained higher concentrations of C, N, K, Ca, and Mg, indicating differences between forest and barrens in important soil chemical properties. Ca and Mg were extremely low in the barrens soil suggesting loss of these nutrients by erosion where there is a lack of vegetation cover. Soil organic matter was higher in forest than in barrens soil and was positively correlated with soil N (r(2)=0.78), dehydrogenase (r(2)=0.65) and acid phosphatase activity (r(2)=0.50). Although microbial biomass was extremely low, dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activity were sensitive indicators of differences in organic matter and microbial activity between forest and barrens soil. The study indicates that certain soil chemical and biological properties may be useful in monitoring ecological change and helpful in understanding vegetation patterns.

AB Soil quality standards and guidelines of the USDA Forest Service were some of the first in the world to be developed to evaluate changes in forest soil productivity and sustainability after harvesting and site preparation. International and national development of criteria and indicators for maintenance of soil productivity make it imperative to have adequate threshold variables within the USDA Forest Service. In the Pacific Northwest soils range from fine-textured Andisols to coarse-textured skeletal Inceptisols. Forest types encompass the highly productive coastal rain forest to marginally productive, dry, cold sites in the interior mountains. Constant values to detect detrimental disturbances within the soil quality guidelines are routinely applied across diverse soils and timber types and include diagnostic criteria for evaluating management-caused changes to soil productivity. Research information from short- or long-term research studies supporting the applicability of disturbance criteria is often lacking, or is available from a limited number of sites which have relatively narrow climatic and soil ranges. In this paper we calculated changes in soil carbon, nitrogen, erosion, and cation exchange capacity using threshold variables from the Regional USDA Forest Service Soil Guidelines to assess their applicability across diverse landscapes. Soils were selected from a climatic and elevational gradient in the Pacific Northwest. Application of selected USDA Forest Service standards indicate that blanket threshold variables applied over disparate soils do not adequately account for nutrient distribution within the profile or forest floor depth. These types of guidelines should be continually refined to reflect pre-disturbance conditions and site-specific information. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Accelerated soil erosion can impact upon agronomic productivity by reducing topsoil depth (TSD), decreasing plant available water capacity and creating nutrient imbalance in soil and within plant. Research information on soil-specific cause-effect relationship is needed to develop management strategies for restoring productivity of eroded soils. Therefore, two field experiments were established on Alfisols in central Ohio to quantify erosion-induced changes in soil properties and assess their effects on corn growth and yield. Experiment 1 involved studying the effects of past erosion on soil properties and corn yield on field runoff plots where soil was severely eroded and comparing it with that on adjacent slightly eroded soil. In addition, soil properties and corn grain yield in runoff plots were compared on side-slopes with that on toe-slopes or depositional sites. Experiment 2 involved relating corn growth and yield to topsoil depth on a sloping land. With recommended rates of fertilizer application, corn grain yield did not differ among erosional phases. Fertilizer application masked the adverse effects of erosion on corn yield. Corn grain yield on depositional sites was about 50 per cent more than that on side-slope position. Corn plants on the side-slope positions exhibited symptoms of nutrient deficiency, and the ear leaves contained significantly lower concentrations of P and Mg and higher concentrations of Mn and K than those grown on depositional sites. Corn grain yield in experiment 2 was positively correlated with the TSD. Soil in the depositional site contained significantly more sand and silt and less clay than that on the side-slope position. There were also differences in soil properties among erosional phases. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content was 19.7 g kg(-1) in slightly eroded compared with 15.1 g kg(-1) in severely eroded sites. Aggregate stability and the mean weight diameter (MWD) were also significantly more in slightly eroded than severely eroded soils. Adverse effects of severe erosion on soil quality were related to reduction in soil water retention, and decrease in soil concentration of N and P, and increase in those of K, Ca and Mg. Severe erosion increased leaf nutrient contents of K, Mn and Fe and decreased those of Ca and Mg. Corn grain yield was positively correlated with aggregation, silt and soil N contents. It was also negatively correlated with leaf content of Fe. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In the central highlands of Mexico, heavily eroded soils are often colonized by catclaw (Mimosa buincifiera): an N-2-fixing shrub. An experiment was carried out to investigate how this shrub affected characteristics of the soil and its biological functioning. Soil was sampled from outside and under the canopy of catclaw at three sites characterized by different degrees of erosion and an increase in plant density. The soil microbial biomass C, total amounts of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and free-living N-2-fixing micro-organisms were measured, while production of CO2 and dynamics of nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-) and ammonium (NH4+) were monitored in an aerobic incubation at 22+/-1 degreesC for 35 days. The C content was 1.6 times greater in the area with the largest density of plants and the least erosion (RECUP) compared with the site with the lowest density and greatest erosion (DEGR), while it was 1.2 times greater under the canopy of the catclaw than outside it (average of the three sites). The incorporation of N into the soil organic matter was greater under the canopy of the catclaw than outside it as the C:N ratio was on average 8.4 and 9.1, respectively. The microbial biomass C, as a percentage of soil. organic matter, was 1.5 times greater in the RECUP than in the DEGR site. Greatest total number of colony-forming bacteria and fungi (mean of organisms found under and outside the canopy) were found in the RECUP treatment and lowest in the DEGR treatment. Free-living N-2-fixing organisms and actinomycetes showed opposite trends. Greater total numbers of colony-forming bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and free-living N-2-fixing organisms (mean of the three treatments) were found under the canopy of catclaw than outside of it, Production of CO2 was 1.8 times greater in the RECUP than in the DEGR and 1.6 times greater under the canopy of catclaw than outside. Production of NO3- was 1.3 times greater in the RECUP than in the DEGR and 3.5 times greater under the canopy of catclaw than outside. There was no significant effect of location or canopy on NO2- and NH4+ concentrations. It is concluded that the natural vegetation of catclaw increased microbial biomass and soil organic matter content under, but also outside its canopy, and preserved N better, releasing greater amounts of inorganic N upon mineralization. Catclaw can serve as a first colonizer of heavily eroded soil and be replaced by other vegetation, natural or crops, when fertility is restored.

AB Suspended matter (SM) from the Nyong basin (Cameroon, Africa), a tropical watershed, was collected by tangential flow ultrafiltration to separate particulate (> 0.45 mu m) and colloidal (< 0.45 mu m; > 20 kDa) fractions. In this basin, two distinctive systems in a selected small catchment (Nsimi-Zoetele) of the Nyong river basin have been considered: (i) colourless water (groundwater and spring) with a low suspended load(< 3 mg/l) and a low total organic carbon content (TOC < 1 mg/l) and (ii) coloured water (Mengong brook and Nyong river), which is organic rich (TOC > 10 mg/l) and contains higher amounts of SM (10-20 mg/l) than the colourless water. Freeze-dried samples of SM have been analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).
   Colourless water mainly contains mineral phases, such as poorly ordered kaolinite, plus quartz and goethite in the particulate fraction, and euhedral kaolinite plus amorphous iron oxyhydroxides in the colloidal fraction. In contrast, the SM in coloured water is mainly organic in nature. The mineral phases in the particulate fraction are similar to those from clear water, but with additional phytoliths and diatom frustules composed of biogenic opal. In the colloidal fraction, complexation of Fe(3+) and Mn(2+) with organic matter is evidenced by EPR, together with significant occurrence of Fe oxyhydroxides associated with organic matter.
   The sites of Al, Si, Fe, Mn in colloidal fractions derived from spectroscopic analyses are discussed with reference to chemical analyses performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Most of the observed solid phases or species correspond to those expected from published thermodynamic calculations for the same hydrosystem, except the colloidal iron oxyhydroxides in the coloured water. The presence of such iron phases is emphasised since they are expected to have large sorption capacities for numerous trace elements.
   The crystal chemistry of SM is used to discuss the origin of the mineral particles transported from the soil to the main rivers in terms of mechanical and chemical erosion processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by interactions among factors operating at several spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative importance and interaction of relatively static landscape factors and more dynamic factors in a shortgrass steppe landscape. The landscape factors examined were topographic position, and soil texture. The dynamic factors studied were seasonal climate and the localized effects of individual plants on soils. Patterns were evaluated by sampling soil between and under individual Bouteloua gracilis plants in paired upland (erosional) and lowland (depositional) plots at eight locations at the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), Colorado. We quantified five organic C and N pools (total, fine and coarse particulate organic matter [POM], mineral-associated organic matter [MAOM], and potentially mineralizable C and N), and we estimated seasonal patterns of in situ N dynamics with three methods (extractable inorganic N, net N mineralization in uncovered cores, and N adsorbed on ion exchange resin [IER] bags).
   Topographic position and soil texture each explained much of the landscape-scale variation of C and N pools and vegetation structure. Most lowland plots were enriched in silt, clay, C, and N relative to adjacent upland plots, and topographic position affected most pools significantly. Most vegetation and biogeochemical variables were strongly correlated with soil sand content. Across the range of sand content encountered (40-83%), the fraction of area in bare soil openings >5 cm across increased sevenfold, and most C and N fractions increased by 2-4.5 times. Plant-induced, microscale heterogeneity of soil C and N was comparable in magnitude to landscape-scale heterogeneity for pools with more rapid turnover (POM and mineralizable C and N), but presence or absence of plants did not affect more stable, mineral-associated organic matter. Plant-induced heterogeneity was significant in all locations, but its importance likely decreases with decreasing sand content as cover becomes more continuous, particularly in lowlands.
   Total extractable inorganic N and nitrate, N adsorbed on resin bags, and the proportion of mineralized N that was nitrified during incubations increased with increasing soil water content or precipitation, but net N mineralization did not vary systematically with precipitation. Inorganic N availability was greatest during relatively moist spring periods, and these were the only times when indices of in situ N availability followed the spatial patterns expected from laboratory assays of C and N pool distribution.
   The relatively weak spatial patterns for N dynamics contrast with the substantial landscape and individual-plant scale variation in C and N pools. Landscape patterns of N mineralization and availability may be tied to N pools, such as POM N, that are not strongly related to topography or texture. Particulate organic matter appears to be especially important to N retention and availability on sandy soils, which typify most sites at the CPER; the proportion of total N residing in POM was high and POM C:N ratios were low in sandy upland soils.
   We suggest that soil texture is a key proximal control over biogeochemical processes and is largely responsible for observed landscape-scale patterns, including topographic differences. Models that integrate effects of texture and topography have the potential to link landscape biogeochemical patterns to short-term processes that directly influence SOM dynamics and to long-term geomorphic processes that influence soil distribution, including eolian redistribution of soil materials, which is important in many dry regions.

AB Recent research has directed attention to the properties of the eroded material because of its influence in deposition phenomena and in carrying capacity of pollutant materials.
   In this paper, the spatial distribution of the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and total organic carbon is firstly deduced using the measurements carried out in 129 soil samples well distributed over the Sicilian Sparacia Basin and a Kriging interpolation method. Then the load of each chemical was calculated at morphological unit and basin scale using the above-mentioned spatial distributions and sediment yield values calculated by a parametric approach such as the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) coupled with a spatial disaggregation criterion of sediment delivery processes. Finally, at basin scale, a new expression of the enrichment ratio of a given pollutant has been proposed; the enrichment ratio values were also related to the corresponding basin sediment delivery ratio values.

ID ECONOMIC COSTS; BENEFITS; SOIL; MITIGATION; ENGLAND
AB This trans-disciplinary study assesses total external environmental and health costs of modern agriculture in the UK. A wide range of datasets have been analysed to assess cost distribution across sectors. We calculate the annual total external costs of UK agriculture in 1996 to be pound 2343 m (range for 1990-1996: pound 1149-3907 m), equivalent to pound 208/ha of arable and permanent pasture. Significant costs arise from contamination of drinking water with pesticides (pound 120 m/year), nitrate (pound 16 m), Cryptosporidium (pound 23 m) and phosphate and soil (pound 55 m), from damage to wildlife, habitats, hedgerows and drystone walls (pound 125 m), from emissions of gases (pound 1113 m), from soil erosion and organic carbon losses (pound 106 m), from food poisoning (pound 169 m), and from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (pound 607 m). This study has only estimated those externalities that give rise to financial costs, and so is likely to underestimate the total negative impacts of modern agriculture. These data help to identify policy priorities, particularly over the most efficient way to internalise these external costs into prices. This would imply a redirection of public subsidies towards encouraging those positive externalities under-provided in the market place, combined with a mix of advisory and institutional mechanisms, regulatory and legal measures, and economic instruments to correct negative externalities. Further work examining the marginal costs and benefits of UK agriculture would help to inform future policy development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The debris-rich basal ice layers of a high Arctic glacier were shown to contain metabolically diverse microbes that could be cultured oligotrophically at low temperatures (0.3 to 4 degrees C). These organisms included aerobic chemoheterotrophs and anaerobic nitrate reducers, sulfate reducers, and methanogens, Colonies purified from subglacial samples at 4 degrees C appeared to be predominantly psychrophilic. Aerobic chemoheterotrophs were metabolically active in unfrozen basal sediments when they were cultured at 0.3 degrees C in the dark (to simulate nearly in situ conditions), producing (CO2)-C-14 from radiolabeled sodium acetate,vith minimal organic amendment (greater than or equal to 38 mu M C). In contrast, no activity was observed when samples were cultured at subfreezing temperatures (less than or equal to-1.8 degrees C) for 66 days. Electron microscopy of thawed basal ice samples revealed various cell morphologies, including dividing cells. This suggests that the subglacial environment beneath a polythermal glacier provides a viable habitat for life and that microbes may be widespread where the basal ice is temperate and water is present at the base of the glacier and where organic carbon from glacially overridden soils is present. Our observations raise the possibility that in situ microbial production of CO2 and CH4 beneath ice masses (e.g., the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets) is an important factor in carbon cycling during glacial periods, Moreover, this terrestrial environment may provide a model for viable habitats for life on Mars, since similar conditions may exist or may have existed in the basal sediments beneath the Martian north polar ice cap.

AB It has been recently suggested that droughts induced by climate warming reduce the catchment export of colour-forming, and therefore, UV-B protective, DOC to boreal lakes, which in turn may influence the health of resident biota. We determined that the concentration of DOC in 116 Canadian boreal lakes increased in relation to the severity of previous (4-13 yr) catchment forest clearance (reference - buffer strip - wildfire burnt - partial basin clearcut - whole basin clearcut), and was negatively related to water transparency. Removing the landscape influence of catchment drainage ratio showed that lakes within clearcut or burnt watersheds averaged 2 to 3 mg L-1 more DOC than those in reference, undisturbed catchments. Our results suggest the limited possibility that the increased incidence of wildfires coincident with climate warming may partially offset the effects of droughts on catchment export of DOC in the short-term, and thus serve to mitigate the effects of damaging UV-B exposure for selected basins in localized regions.

AB The present study is based on the optical (palynofacies) and geochemical (pyrolyse Rock-Eval) characterization of the organic matter occurring both in bedrock, soils, river sediments (suspended matter and bedload) in a Draix Erosional Research Basin (Cemagref). Results confirm firstly the contribution of reworked organic matter in modern fluxes. Numerous previous studies have shown that organic matter analysis can be an accurate tool to provide information concerning past climates and past environments. Present results suggests that such analysis can also give information concerning the characterization of eroded bedrocks and of erosional. processes such as river bank erosion and runoff.

AB The hydrology and ecological linkages between Kheoheopalri lake and its surrounding watershed (area: 12 km(2)) in Sikkim were investigated to assess the long-term impacts of land-use/cover change on the hydrology of the lake ecosystem and bog formation around the glaciated lake. Significant land-use/cover change occurred in the past 4 decades. The bog area expanded by 67%, while the area under agriculture land in the lake watershed grew by 63% between 1988 and 1997. Overland flow was highest on the bare land (4.77% of the precipitation) and lowest in areas of cardamom-based agroforestry (1.79%). Soil and nutrient losses were highest in the cultivated area and least in the cardamom agroforestry system. Sediment loads of 345 Mg year(-1) were recorded at the lake inlet and of 316 Mg year(-1) at the outlet. Annual soil loss from the lake watershed was 502 Mg km(-2) and a net sediment deposition in the lake was 141 Mg year(-1). The lake received high nutrient loads (organic carbon of 10.2 Mg year(-1), total nitrogen of 1.01 Mg year(-1) and total phosphorus of 0.51 Mg year(-1)) from soil erosion and overland flow. The pH, total phosphorus and bulk density of the peat increased from the lake towards the bog-forest edge. This reflects the trapping of sediments and nutrients around the hog forest margin, although their retention is limited. Agricultural practices should be minimized in the upper part of the watershed and agroforestry practices should be: encouraged to maintain the health and longevity of the lake, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We develop a dynamic soil quality model to evaluate optimal cropping systems in the northern Great Plains. Modeling soil quality attributes is feasible, and attribute model results apply to a wide range of soils. A crop production system with continuous spring wheat and direct planting is the most profitable system. This system has low soil erosion and high quality attributes, indicating the benefits of increased soil quality exceed the higher maintenance costs. On-site value of additional soil organic carbon (OC) ranges from $1 to $4/ton OC/hectare/year. These values for soil OC impact the optimum tillage practice, but not the crop rotation.

AB Food security in the East African Highlands is dependent upon the productivity of lands managed by smallholders who face difficult challenges in maintaining the fertility of their soils. A study was conducted to identify indicators of soil fertility status that are consistent with farmers' perceptions of soil fertility. Physical, chemical and biological properties of soils were measured from paired fields identified as either productive or non-productive by 12 farmers and compared to findings of a household survey on soil fertility management. Special attention was given to the potential of different soil organic matter fractions to serve as diagnostic indicators of soil fertility. Farmers' criteria for distinguishing soil productivity included crop performance, soil tilth, moisture and colour and presence of weeds and soil invertebrates. All farmers attributed low fertility to inadequate use of organic and inorganic fertilisers (100%) and removal of crop residues (100%). Other causes included continuous cropping (83%), lack of crop rotation (66%) and soil erosion (42%). Productive soils had significantly higher soil pH, effective cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cations, extractable P and total N and P than non-productive soils. Total organic C and several estimates of soil labile C including particulate organic C (POC), three Ludox density separates of POC, KMnO4-oxidizable C and microbial biomass C were significantly greater in productive soils. Soil microbial biomass N, net N mineralisation and soil respiration were also significantly higher in productive soils. Farmers' perceptions of soil quality were substantiated through soil chemical analyses and soil organic matter fractions provided precise information on these differences. The similarity of soil physical properties in productive and non-productive fields suggests that differences in chemical and biological indicators may have resulted, in part, from smallholders' management and are not inherent properties of the soils.

AB Human population pressures upon land resources have increased the need to assess impacts of land use change on soil quality. In order to assess effects of land use changes on soil quality properties in a tropical forest ecosystem of Bangladesh, soil samples were collected from adjacent well-stocked Shorea robusta natural forest, land reforested with Acacia, grassland and cultivated land. Land use/land cover changes (degradation of natural forest and subsequent cultivation of soils) resulted in surface compaction and significant decreases in silt and clay contents, porosity and aggregate stability, N, fulvic and labile C, and microbial biomass C. Maintenance respiration rates increased in comparison to the soils under natural forest. Use of soil deterioration index showed that soil quality deteriorated significantly (-44%) under cultivation, while in sites revegetated with fast-growing Acacia or grasses, it improved by 6-16%. Degradation of soil quality may have resulted from increased disruption of macroaggregates, reductions in microbial biomass, and loss of labile organic matter due to fire, deforestation, tillage and accelerated erosion. Improvement in soil quality and enhanced biological activity at reforested and grassland sites demonstrated the inherent resilience of these soils once revegetated with highly adaptable and fast growing Acacia (Acacia sp.) and grass species.

AB Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) production has increased in the central Great Plains, but Little is known regarding how this crop will affect surface biomass production, various soil quality indicators, and subsequent winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields. We hypothesized that sunflower production was reducing soil quality relative to other summer crops because of the need for tillage to incorporate herbicide, thus reducing surface residue. Our objectives were to quantify on a Weld silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic, Aridic Argiustolls) surface crop residue levels immediately after seeding wheat, subsequent wheat grain yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic matter-carbon (POM-C), aggregate stability, and texture in 3- or 4-year rotation. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used to compare rotations both with and without sunflower. Our data showed 13% lower SOC content and 26% lower POM-C content at the 0- to 5-cm depth in rotations with sunflower versus those without. At the 5- to 15- cm depths, differences were not significant (P < 0.05). Crop residue by mass was 5 times lower and wheat yields 33% lower in rotations with sunflower, but no differences were measured for wind erodible aggregates or texture. Tillage to incorporate herbicides for sunflower and low amounts of residue after sunflower in the 3-year rotation contributed to reduced SOC and POM-C, decreased residue at wheat planting, and reduced wheat yield. If sunflower is to be included in the central Great Plains, efforts should be made to use no-till production practices and 4-year rotations with corn.

AB Technological advances in sugar-cane harvesting and processing is bringing about rapid changes in production systems which could impact on soil physical conditions. An increasing incidence of soil structural decline and depletion of soil carbon levels has increased the risk of soil erosion and crop yield reductions. Soil carbon (C) and aggregate stability were studied on a sugar-cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) green trash blanket trial that had been established on a Chromic Luvisol soil at Mackay, Qld, Australia in 1992. The experiment consisted of blocks with two blocks being harvested early and the remaining two blocks harvested late in the crushing season. Within each block, treatment combinations of trash burnt or green trash blanket, which are either cultivated between rows or not cultivated after harvest, were included. Cropping and cultivation of the soil reduced the different C fractions in the surface 0-100 mm layer by 66-67% when compared to an adjacent uncropped reference soil. The labile C (C-L) concentration was 11% lower in the burnt treatment compared to the trash returned treatment but the opposite was found for total C (CT) After four years, the no cultivation treatment had higher concentrations of all C fractions measured, compared to the cultivated treatment. When compared to the uncropped reference soil, cropping resulted in marked reductions in aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) and aggregates >250 mu m and an increase in aggregates <125 mu m determined by both immersion and tension wetting. The return of the green trash resulted in a 30% greater MWD and a 28% increase in aggregates >250 mu m and an 18% reduction in aggregates <125 mu m compared to the burnt treatment when immersion wetting was used. Four years of cultivation reduced the MWD, as determined by immersion wetting, by 26% compared to the no cultivation treatment. No significant correlations were found between any measured C fraction and aggregate stability. This study indicates that sustainable sugar-cane cropping systems will likely be those where cultivation is kept to a minimum and trash is retained in the system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Soil water availability is most essential in the Sahelian agriculture but is hampered by several factors. Surface crusts or crust-like surfaces, which are characteristic of most Sahelian soils, have been shown to decrease water infiltrability and increase runoff. Their type and structure are influenced by soil texture, vegetation cover, erosion and deposition effects of wind and water. A soil and terrain survey in semi-arid SW-Niger was carried out to explain the patterns of soil surface crusts and the deterioration of the land. The soil surface, crusts were shown to depend also on specific terrain factors including land use type and intensity, and terrain type and position. Chemical and physical soil factors such as organic carbon, soil colour and texture occurring with specific crusts indicate soil degradation, especially in sloping terrain, which increases runoff and soil erosion. For sandy soils, surface tillage is required to break up the crusts. Higher surface organic matter is recommended to enhance water infiltration in soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Soil accretion, sediment deposition, and nutrient (N, P, organic C) accumulation were compared in floodplain and depressional freshwater wetlands of southwestern Georgia, USA to evaluate the role of riverine (2600 km(2) catchment) versus depressional (<10 km(2) catchment) wetlands as sinks for sediment and nutrients. Soil cores were collected from three floodplain (cypress-gum) and nine depressional (three each from cypress-gum forest, cypress-savannah, and herbaceous marsh) wetlands and analyzed for radionuclides ((CS)-C-137, Pb-210), bulk density, N, P, and organic C to quantify recent (30-year) and long-term (100-year) rates of sediment and nutrient accumulation. There was no significant difference in organic C, N, or sediment accumulation between depressional and floodplain wetlands. However, P accumulation was 1.5 to three times higher in the floodplain (0.12-0.75 g/m(2)/yr) than in the depressional wetlands (0.08-0.25 g/m(2)/yr). Sediment and nutrient accumulations were highly variable among depressional wetland types, more so than between depressional and floodplain wetlands. This variability likely is the result of differences in historical land use, hydrology, vegetation type, NPP, and perhaps fire frequency. Mean (n = 12) one-hundred-year rates of sediment deposition (1036 g/m(2)/yr), organic C (79 g/m(2)/yr), N (6.0 g/m(2)/yr), and P accumulation (0.38 g/m(2)/yr) were much higher than 30-year rates (sediment = 118 g/m(2)/yr, C = 20 g/m(2)/yr, N = 1.5 g/m(2)/yr, P = 0.09 g/m(2)/yr). Higher 100-year (Pb-210) Sediment and nutrient accumulations Likely reflect the greater numbers of farms, greater grazing by livestock, and the absence of environmentally sound agricultural practices in southwestern Georgia at the turn of the century. Our findings suggest that the degree of anthropogenic disturbance within the surrounding watershed regulates wetland sediment, organic C, and N accumulation. Phosphorus accumulation also is greater in floodplain wetlands that have large catchments containing fine textured (clay) sediments that are co-deposited with P.

AB Earlier studies in South Africa had shown that water repellency in the soils of timber plantations was associated with a greater risk of overland flow and soil erosion on mountain slopes. This paper reports on a follow-up study to determine how prevalent water repellent soils are in the forestry areas of South Africa, and to what extent this phenomenon is associated with specific vegetation types. Soils from a representative series of forestry sites around South Africa were sampled from beneath each genus or plantation type and the range of local vegetation types. These soils were dried at low oven temperatures and then subjected to a series of tests of soil wettability, namely, water drop penetration time, infiltration rate, critical surface tension and apparent advancing contact angle as determined by the equilibrium capillary rise test.
   Water repellency is common in dried soils from timber plantations. The dominant variation in repellency is explained by the different vegetation types: soils beneath eucalypts are most repellent, followed by those beneath wattle (Acacia species), indigenous forest and pine. Soils beneath grassland and fynbos scrub were least likely to show repellency, perhaps because regular fires remove plant litter and thus the potential for hydrophobic substances to develop. Soil characteristics explained very little of the variation in repellency. Organic carbon content was weakly correlated with higher repellency, but organic carbon content and soil texture added little explanation to models that first accounted for variation in vegetation type and point of origin. These results are broadly the same regardless of which method of measuring repellency was used. However, the critical surface tension test was far superior to the others in terms of information gained, speed, efficiency and statistical utility of the resultant scores, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

AB Soils are an effective sink for carbon storage and immobilization through biomass productivity and enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. The SOC sink capacity depends on land use and management. Degraded lands lose large amounts of C through SOC decomposition, erosion, and leaching. Thus, restoration of disturbed and degraded mine lands can lead to increase in biomass productivity, improved soil duality and SOC enhancement and sequestration. Reclamation of mined lands is an aggrading process and offers significant potential to sequester C. A chronosequence study consisting of 0-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 25-year-old reclaimed mine soils in Ohio was initiated to assess the rate of C sequestration by pasture and forest establishment. Undisturbed pasture and forest were used as controls. The SOC pool of reclaimed pasture sites increased from 15.3 Mg ha(-1) to 44.4 Mg ha(-1) for 0-15 cm depth and from 10.8 Mg ha(-1) to 18.3 Mg ha(-1) for 15-30 cm depth over the period of 25 years. The SOC pool of reclaimed forest sites increased from 12.7 Mg ha(-1) to 45.3 Mg ha(-1) for 0-15 cm depth and from 9.1 Mg ha(-1) to 13.6 Mg ha(-1) for 15-30 cm depth over the same time period. The SOC pool of the pasture site stabilized earlier than that of the forest site which had not yet attained equilibrium. The SOC sequestered in 0-30 cm depth over 25 years was 36.7 Mg ha(-1) for pasture and 37.1 Mg ha(-1) for forest. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil aggregation is important for maintaining soil surface integrity and allowing water to infiltrate, rather than runoff and cause erosion. The effect of grazing animals on soil aggregation compared with other conservation management strategies in the Southern Piedmont USA is not well known. We tested a hypothesis that grazing animals might negatively affect soil aggregation characteristics. Water-stable macroaggregates (>0.25 mm), mean-weight diameter, and their stabilities were (i) similar between conservation-tillage cropping and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.) pasture; (ii) similar between 15- to 19-yr-old grazed and hayed hybrid bermudagrass; (iii) 7 to 14% greater in 30-yr-old than in 10-yr-old grazed tall fescue and hybrid bermudagrass pastures; (iv) similar among long-term grazingland, hayland, and forestland; and (v) 5 to 11% lower under cattle grazing than under monthly haying or unharvested management during the first 4 yr following conversion of cultivated cropland to pastureland. Water-stable aggregate distribution at a depth of 0 to 50 mm was 0.30 +/- 0.07 g g(-1) in the 1.0- to 4.75-mm class, 0.46 +/- 0.07 g g(-1) in the 0.25- to 1.0-mm class, 0.15 +/- 0.02 g g(-1) in the 0.05- to 0.25-mm class, and 0.07 +/- 0.01 g g(-1) in the <0.05-mm class, averaged across management systems and replications (n = 56). Total glomalin of the 1.0- to 4.75-mm dry-stable aggregate class was highly related to whole soil organic C content, but neither of these properties was particularly well related with water-stable macroaggregation, mean-weight diameter, or their stabilities. We conclude, overall, that grazing of pastures in the Southern Piedmont USA has little detrimental effect on soil aggregate distribution and stability and is comparable in soil conservation with other land conservation strategies.

AB Phosphorus transferred from land to water is a major problem across the world. Identifying the source of phosphorus in water is an important prerequisite to the development of remedial strategies. In this paper, key aspects of phosphorus transfer from grazing land to water are reviewed along with the techniques that may be used to trace its origin.
   Dissolution and erosion are the two processes that can mobilise phosphorus. Erosion is the physical transport of sediment, arbitrarily defined as materials that do not pass through a 0.45 mu m filter, while dissolution is the transport of phosphorus either chemically dissolved in water or attached to colloidal material capable of passing through a 0.45 pm filter.
   Most phosphorus is transported from well managed pastures of southern Australia in a dissolved form (<0.45 mu m) and the highest loads typically occur in surface runoff.
   Being monoisotopic in its natural state, phosphorus cannot be directly traced. However, a range of techniques have been used to identify the source of sediment, and by implication, the attached phosphorus mobilised by erosion processes. With minor exceptions no such techniques are available for tracing phosphorus mobilised by dissolution processes.
   Organic marker compounds (biomarkers) may have useful attributes for phosphorus tracing. There are a vast range of biomarker compounds including sterols, phospholipids and alkanes, that are specific to potential phosphorus sources at a farm scale, and specific to particular land uses at a catchment scale (e.g. faeces and both live and decaying vegetation). This paper investigates the use of biomarkers to augment the current suite of phosphorus tracing techniques at both farm and catchment scales. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The geochemical study of surface sediments (vertical profiles of 30-80 cm) from lentic ecosystems of the Tapajos River permit the observation of environmental changes responsible for the mercury contamination of aquatic systems exploited by the human riverine population. The Arapiuns and Amazon rivers are compared. Measurements of mercury, textural indicators (water content and dry density), mineralogic indicators (iron and aluminum associated with oxyhydroxides and aluminosilicates), and organic indicators (carbon, nitrogen, atomic C/N ratio) were performed over the full length of the cores. The results demonstrate that soil erosion is responsible for an increase in surficial sediment mercury concentrations in the different aquatic systems of the Tapajos and Arapiuns rivers. This increase is the result of the relative enrichment of the sedimentary deposits in fine particulates rich in aluminosilicates, oxyhydroxides and mercury, transported in suspension in the water column. The oxyhydroxides of iron and aluminum associated with fine, clayey particles seem to control the accumulation of heavy metals in the sediments of the Tapajos, Arapiuns and Amazon rivers. Overall, the mercury levels in the sediments studied have the same relationship with the aluminosilicates and the texture of the sediments. The quantity of aluminosilicates permits the evaluation of diagenetic effects, the influence of the clay content and the matrix effect on the levels of mercury in sediments. The activity of lead-210 measured in two cores suggests that the superficial sediments originate from eroded soils. A preliminary dating using the constant initial concentration model indicates that the environmental changes recorded in the Tapajos River sediments would have been initiated some time between the 1950s and 1970s. They would then coincide with the important colonization of the Brazilian Amazon during this period. The results presented have important implications for the geochemical interpretation of anthropogenic disturbances in the Amazon. They demonstrate that the recent colonization of the drainage basins and the growing exploitation of new parcels of land in the central Amazon disturb the mineral and organic matter cycles, as well as that of mercury. The ensuing result is increased exportation of fine particulate mercury from the surface of soils to drainage waters that transport them to fluvio-lacustrine systems where they finally settle out.

AB Drylands occupy 40% of the earth's surface and are prone to land degradation by different processes. Desertification, a vague and qualitative term, implying degradation of soil and vegetation due to anthropogenic activity, reportedly affects 3.6 billion ha of the drylands. Although desertification is most severe in sub-Saharan Africa, the problem is nor confined to the developing countries and is also prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions of North America, Australia, and parts of Europe. Degradation of soil and vegetation leads to emission of greenhouse gases (e.g.. CO2, CH4, N2O) to the atmosphere. In contrast, improvement of soil quality through adoption of restorative measures can lead to increase in soil organic carbon content, improvement in biomass productivity, and mitigation of the greenhouse effect. Technological options for soil and vegetation restoration depend on ecozone characteristics and need to be validated and fine-tuned for site-specific situations. Restorative technologies include introducing appropriate plant species adopted to harsh environments, controlling erosion and reclaiming salt-affected soils, adopting water harvesting techniques and efficient irrigation systems. The potential of C sequestration of such measures may be 30 to 200 kg ha(-1) y(-1) depending on soil and ecozone characteristics Identification of "trigger spots" may be necessary to set in motion the restorative process. While the potential of C sequestration in drylands may be high (0.9-1.9 Pg y(-1)), realization of even a fraction of this potential requires a coordinated effort at national and international levels. Development of a policy that involves participation of farmers and land managers is crucial in this endeavor.

AB Soil profiles were sampled at 43 sites on granitic parent material at altitudes ranging from 970 to 1300 m in the Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland. Many soils under undisturbed vegetation showed evidence of iron and organic matter translocation with distinctive Bh or Bs horizons. Approximately 50% of the sites sampled had no or partial vegetation cover, due either to human activity (trampling) or active geomorphic processes such as cryoturbation on patterned ground. Exposed cols and summit ridges were most heavily affected by trampling with extensive areas of path development and some erosion. Trampling was principally associated with loss of the upper soil horizons and cryoturbation processes with disturbance of horizon development. Median total organic matter at the vegetated sites ranged from 4.8 to 22.0 kg m(-2) with a median of 9.5 kg m-2. There was significantly less total organic matter at the unvegetated sites with median of 4.6 kg m(-2) and range from 1.5 to 11.9 kg m(-2). There was little difference in total organic matter between sites where vegetation disturbance was due to human trampling or to cryoturbation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing agronomic productivity and improving the quality of the environment are among the important goals of soil physical management in the tropics. Several perceptions, created by insufficient scientific data and misunderstanding of the basic processes, are being resolved by an improved data base and better understanding of the dynamics of soil physical properties and processes. Principal issues in the tropics for the 21st century include: (i) achieving food security; (ii) curtailing soil degradation and restoring degraded soils; and (iii) improving environment quality. These issues can be addressed by identifying and prioritizing research needs in soil physical management. Important among these are: (i) assessing soil physical constraints at farm scale; (ii) managing soil structure and tilth to minimize the risks of crusting, compaction, and hard-setting; (iii) quantifying and controlling soil erosion by water and wind, developing a cause-effect relationship between soil and climate factors, and evaluating the effects on productivity; (iv) managing soil-water, controlling soil salinity in irrigated agriculture, and developing water harvesting techniques in rain-fed agricultural systems; (v) studying the dynamics of soil physical properties in puddled soils of rice-based cropping systems; (vi) developing conservation tillage and residue management methods to improve soil tilth; (vii) understanding soil moisture retention characteristics in relation to plant available water capacity; and (viii) developing indicators of soil physical quality. Important environmental issues relevant to soil physical management are transport of agricultural chemicals into surface and ground waters, emission of greenhouse gases from soils to the atmosphere, and disposal of urban and industrial wastes. Soil physical management in the tropics must be based on a holistic approach to solve practical problems. It is also important to make the public aware of the contributions of soil science to society's well-being. In addition to enhancing food production, soil physical management needs to address environmental, engineering, social, legal, and archeological issues. Achieving these goals necessitates soil scientists working in close collaboration with engineers, climatologists, geologists, biologists, and specialists in GIS and geostatistics.

DT Article
AB Little is known about changes in soil organic C (SOC) and total N with depth and with land use. We conducted this study to determine the depth of changes in SOC and total N under different management regimes in the chernozem soil. Four sites were sampled: a native grassland field (not cultivated for at least 300 yr), an adjacent 50-yr continuous-fallow field, a yearly cut hay field in the V.V. Alekhin Central-Chernozem Biosphere State Reserve in the Kursk region of Russia, and a continuously cropped field in the Experimental Station of the Kursk Institute of Agronomy and Soil Erosion Control. All sampled soils mere classified as fine-silty, mixed, frigid Pachic Hapludolls, Soil organic C, total N contents, and bulk densities with depth were compared. Significant reductions in SOC and total N concentrations were detected to a depth of 120 to 130 cm in the 50-yr continuous fallow; Geld and to a depth of 80 cm in the continuously cropped field. Highest reductions were observed in the top 10 cm of soil, where reduction in SOC ranged from 38 to 43% and reduction in total N ranged from 45 to 53%, Significant losses of SOC and total N per equivalent soil mass on an area basis were observed to a depth of 60 cm in the continuously cropped field and to a depth of 100 cm in the 50-yr; continuous-fallow field.

AB Soil organic matter decline and associated degradation of soil and environmental conditions under conventional tillage in tropical and subtropical regions underline the need to develop sustainable soil management systems. This study aimed first to evaluate the long-term effect (9 years) of two soil-tillage systems (conventional tillage: CT, and no-tillage: NT) and two cropping systems (oat (Avena strigosa Schreb)/maize (Zea mays L.): O/M; and oat+common vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/ maize+cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp): O+V/M+C without N fertilization on total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in a sandy clay loam Acrisol in southern Brazil. The second objective was to assess soil potential for acting as an atmospheric CO2 sink. Under NT an increase of soil TOC and TN concentrations occurred, in both cropping systems, when compared with CT. However, this increase was restricted to soil surface layers and it was higher for O+V/M+C than for O/M, The O+V/M+C under NT, which probably results in the lowest soil organic matter losses (due to erosion and oxidation) and highest addition of crop residues, had 12 Mg ha(-1) more TOC and 0.9 Mg ha(-1) more TN in the 0-30.0 cm depth soil layer, compared with O/M under CT which exhibits highest soil organic matter losses and lowest crop residue additions to the soil. These increments represent TOC and TN accumulation rates of 1.33 and 0.10 Mg ha(-1) per year, respectively. Compared with CT and O/M, this TOC increase under NT and O+V/M+C means a net carbon dioxide removal of about 44 Mg ha(-1) from the atmosphere in 9 years. NT can therefore be considered, as it is in temperate climates, an important management strategy for increasing soil organic matter. In the tropicals and subtropicals, where climatic conditions cause intense biological activity, in order to maintain or increase soil organic matter, improve soil quality and contribute to mitigation of CO2 emissions, NT should be associated with cropping systems resulting in high annual crop residue additions to soil surface.

AB Because crop management has a strong influence on soil C, we analyzed results of a 30-yr crop rotation experiment, initiated in 1967 on a medium textured Orthic Brown Chemozem at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, to determine the influence of cropping frequency, fertilizers and crop types on soil organic C (SOC) changes in the 0- to 15-cm depth. Soil organic C in the 0- to 15-cm and 15- to 30-cm depths were measured in 1976, 1981, 1984, 1990, 1993, and 1996, but results are only presented for the 0- to 15-cm depth since changes in the 15- to 30-cm depth were not significant. We developed an empirical equation to estimate SOC dynamics in the rotations. This equation uses two first order kinetic expressions, one to estimate crop residue decomposition and the other to estimate soil humus C mineralization. Crop residues (including roots) were estimated from straw yields, either measured or calculated from grain yields. The parameter values in our equation were obtained from the scientific literature or were based on various assumptions. Carbon lost by wind and water erosion was estimated using the EPIC model. We found that (i) SOC was increased most by annual cropping with application of adequate fertilizer N and P; (ii) that frequent fallowing resulted in lowest SOC except when fall-seeded crops, such as fall rye (Secale cereale L.), that reduce erosion were included in the rotation, and (iii) the fallow effects are exacerbated when low residue yielding flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) was included in the rotation. Some of the imprecision in SOC values we speculated to be related to variations in soil texture at the test site. In the first 10 yr of the experiment, SOC was low and constant for fallow-spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (F-W) and F-W-W rotations because this land was managed in this manner for the previous 50 yr. However, in rotations that received N + P fertilizer and were cropped annually [continuous wheat (Cont W) and wheat-lentil (Lens culinaris L.)], or that included fall-seeded crops (e.g., F-Rye-W), SOC appeared to increase sharply in this period. In the drought period (1984-1988) SOC was generally constant, but large increases occurred in the wet period (1990 to 1996) in response to high residue inputs. The efficiency of conversion of residue C to SOC for the 30-yr experimental period was about 10-12% for F-W, F-W-W and Cent W (+P) systems, and it was about 17-18% for the well fertilized F-Rye-W, Cent W, and W-Lent systems. The average annual SOC gains (Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) between 1967 and 1996 were 0.11 for F-W (N + P), 0.09 for the mean of the three F-W-W rotations (N + P, + N, + P), 0.23 for F-Rye-W (N + P), 0.32 for Cent W (N + P), 0.12 for Cent W (+ P), and 0.28 for W-Lent (N + P). The corresponding mean estimated (by our equation) annual SOC gains for these rotations, were 0.06, 0.10, 0.16, 0.22, 0.14, and 0.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Because soil C measurements are usually so variable, we recommend that calculations such as ours may be employed to assist in the interpretation of measured C trends and to test if they seem reasonable.

AB Heavy metals in dredged sediment disposal sites may be transported through runoff and percolation. In the present study metal fluxes by runoff and percolation were determined under simulated rainfall at a slope of 19% and a rainfall intensity of approximately 40 mm h(-1). These circumstances correspond to half the mean annual erosivity of rain under Belgian weather conditions. Surface runoff and percolating water samples were analysed for suspended solids, total dissolved carbon and Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Runoff rate and sediment yields were highest for a silt loam sediment, characterised by a low clay and organic matter content. Metal concentrations in runoff and percolating water varied widely between the sediments studied and were related to the total metal content in the sediment. In runoff and percolating water from the contaminated sediments, metal concentrations strongly exceeded the Netherlands A reference values for ground water quality. Very high metal fluxes were observed for the recently oxidised dredged sediment. Metal transport per unit surface area through percolating water was from two to more than twenty times greater than that in surface runoff.

AB A possible biological component of the explanation for the lack of substantial coal formation on Antarctica between the Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous is hypothesised. Forcing a process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry model with climate model simulations for three successive intervals of the Mesozoic [Late Jurassic (150 Ma), mid-Cretaceous (100 Ma) and Late Cretaceous (65 Ma)], predicts the establishment of productive terrestrial ecosystems with substantial soil carbon pools throughout the land surface of Antarctica between 150 and 65 million years ago. Sensitivity analyses indicate the annual land surface hydrological budget of Antarctica 150 - 65 Ma was largely balanced due to the effects of canopy transpiration on soil moisture. Post-depositional erosion and tectonic setting must have played an important role in determining coal preservation on the continent. However, the model results indicate that an active vegetated land surface precluded the preservation of the substantial soil organic carbon inputs by minimising the potential for anaerobic preservation (i.e. water logging).

   METHODOLOGY
AB To test the hypothesis that net nitrogen (N) mineralisation is concentrated in the surface few centimetres following minimal soil disturbance for crop establishment, mineralisation was measured during the growth of wheat. The soil was a Red Kandosol located in southern New South Wales. Mineralisation was estimated using in situ incubations inside capped PVC tubes, which were sampled every 3 weeks. Soil from the tubes was sampled at depth intervals of 2 cm to a depth of 10 cm and at 5-cm intervals from 10 to 20 cm.
   The results showed that net N mineralisation decreased with depth to 20 cm. Over the season, an average of 32% of the N mineralised in the top 20 cm of soil originated from the 0-2 cm layer, 72% was from the 0-6 cm layer, and only 13% was from soil below 10 cm. The decrease in N mineralisation with soil depth was highly correlated with decreases in the organic carbon (r(2) = 0.84, P < 0.05) and total N (r(2) = 0.83, P < 0.05) concentration. The soil's N-supplying ability is concentrated near the surface where it is susceptible to erosional loss. The N supply may also be inhibited by temperature and moisture extremes, which are common in the surface few centimetres of soil where mineralisation was concentrated. The PVC enclosures created artefacts in soil temperature and moisture, although it is argued that the effects on net N mineralisation were small in most sampling periods.

AB The aim of this research was to enable erodibility values for hillslope-scale erosion prediction models to be determined from easily measured media properties. Simulated rainfall and overland flow experiments were carried out on 34 soils and overburdens from 15 Queensland open-cut coal mines at The University of Queensland Erosion Processes Laboratory. Properties of the 34 media determined included aggregate stability, Atterberg limits, bulk density, cation exchange capacity, dispersion ratios, electrical conductivity, exchangeable sodium percentage, organic carbon content, pH, texture, and water content at field capacity and wilting point. Correlation and stepwise multiple regression procedures were used to determine those media properties that could best be used to predict rill and interill erodibility. Correlations between media properties and sediment delivery at each of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30% slope revealed that different media properties were correlated with erosion rates at different slopes. A media property could show a strong correlation with erodibility at 30% slope, and a low correlation at 5% slope. Splitting the data set into soils only, and overburdens only, showed that properties that were positively correlated with erosion rates for one group could be negatively correlated for the other group. Therefore, in this study, erodibility could not be explicitly linked to one set of media properties for all medium types and erosive conditions. It was concluded that a single regression equation could not be used to predict erodibility under all conditions. Instead, 4 equations were developed to predict rill and interill erodibility, for soils and overburdens separately. The need for separate regression equations was attributed to the presence of different erosive sub-processes for specific combinations of medium type and slope gradient.

AB Prince Edward Island (PEI) has a land area of 575,000 hectares and its landscape is undulating. About half the land is cleared, the other half under natural forest. The long term effect of intensive farming practices on soil health is becoming a matter of concern as it is felt that soil quality may deteriorate through continuous agrichemical inputs and loss of productive topsoil through erosion. This study was established to: set up a process to measure soil quality, establish soil quality indicators, measure soil quality on an on-going basis and report results to the public. The sampling locations were selected on a 4 km x 4 km grid across PEI. A total of 232 agricultural sampling locations were selected and located by GPS (Global Positioning System). A cluster of up to five samples was taken at each location, depending on land use. One sample will be taken at the selected GPS coordinates and the other four, 100 metres due south, north, west and east respectively. In the 232 sampling locations selected, the actual number of samples taken will be 796. One third of the sampling locations are being sampled each year, starting in 1998. Three groups of parameters are being measured: Physical Parameters (depth of A and B horizons soil type, length and degree of slope, position of sample on slope, crops grown, crop rotation and type of tillage), Chemical Parameters (Organic Matter, Total Carbon, pH, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Boron, Zinc, Sulfur, Manganese, Iron, Sodium, CEC, and Base Saturation), Microbial Parameters (microscopic observation, enzyme assays). The analyses of the collected data focuses on determining the existence of statistically significant relationships among the measured variables. The methods to be applied include logistic and linear regression, examination of correlations, as well as methods specifically designed for spatial or geographic data. GIS (Geographical Information System) maps of PEI are being be developed to show patterns of the various parameters measured. As data collection proceeds over time, time series methods or longitudinal methods of regression will also be employed to determine if the relationships or associations observed in the initial data hold up over time. This project will provide information to policy makers, researchers and the general pubic about Prince Edward Island current soil quality and the trends in soil quality over time.

AB Soil erosion Fates are a key factor for understanding changes in soil organic carbon. (137)Cesium was used to estimate erosion rates in long-term cropping experiments in eastern Oregon. Based on the (137)Cs measurements, RUSLE or EPIC estimates, and visual observations there is little evidence of water erosion at these experimental sites. Since there is little evidence of soil movement front the experimental sites to explain a steady decline in soil organic carbon (Rasmussen and Albrecht, 1998), then our study supports the conclusion that the major contributing factor for the declining soil organic matter is biological oxidation. The fallow conditions would provide excellent conditions for biological activity by microorganisms. Our study would indicate that under certain conditions biological oxidation is the most important factor for soil organic carbon loss. While there is great potential to sequester carbon in agricultural soils (Lal, et al., 1998), knowing the mechanism of carbon loss from the soil is necessary to determine its fate in the environment. While eroded soil carbon may end up being sequestered in the sediments of lakes and estuaries, biologically oxidized soil carbon will be released directly to the atmosphere as CO(2).

AB Long-term monitoring is needed for direct assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil, and nutrient loss by water erosion on a watershed scale. However, labor and capital requirements preclude implementation of such monitoring at many locations representing principal soils and ecoregions. These considerations warrant the development of diagnostic models to assess erosional SOC loss from more readily obtained data. The same factors affect transport of SOC and mineral soil fraction, suggesting that given the gain or loss of soil minerals, it may be possible to estimate the SOC flux from the data on erosion and deposition. One possible approach to parameterization is the use of the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) to predict soil loss and this multiplied by the per cent of SOC in the near-surface soil and an enrichment factor to obtain SOC loss. The data obtained from two watersheds in Ohio indicate that a power law relationship between soil loss and SOC loss may be more appropriate. When measured SOC loss from individual events over a 12-year period was plotted against measured soil loss the data were logarithmically linear (R(2) = 0.75) with a slope (or exponent in the power law) slightly less than would be expected for a RUSLE type model. The stable aggregate size distribution in runoff from a plot scale may be used to estimate the fate of size pools of SOC by comparing size distributions in the runoff plot scale and river watershed scales. Based upon this comparison, a minimum of 73 per cent of material from runoff plots is deposited on the landscape and the most stable carbon pool is lost from watershed soils to aquatic ecosystems and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Implicit in these models is the supposition that water stable soil aggregates and primary particles can be viewed as a tracer for SOC, Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Cool season food legumes (CSFL) are minor crops compared to cereals, but they are important in farming systems, in human and animal nutrition and as a source of biological N. They protect the soil from erosion, add organic matter, fix nitrogen and spare soil mineral N as well as helping control cereal diseases. They provide more flexible weed control options. Two major factors may lead to the increased use of cool season food legumes in cereal based cropping systems. The first is the demand for grain with a high protein content and other nutritional factors, for human and animal consumption. The second is the realisation of their importance as a "break" crop in continuous non-legume cropping systems.
   The contribution of pulses to increased cereal production will come from a better understanding of rotations and production packages, better information on the residual effects of legumes, development of simulation models to predict these effects and the enhancement of biological N(2) fixation. The pulses themselves require continued support to develop better disease resistance, higher yields, better fashioned cultivars for specific cropping environments, technological packages and extension support and,more sophisticated local and international marketing strategies. Cereal-legume relations enable the use of different herbicides in the respective crops and reduce the risk of herbicide resistance in weeds.

AB We examined the effects of treefall gap size and soil properties on microbial biomass dynamics in an undisturbed mature-phase humid subtropical broadleaved forest in north-east India. Canopy gaps had low soil moisture and low microbial biomass suggesting that belowground dynamics accompanied changes in light resources after canopy opening. High rainfall in the region causes excessive erosion/leaching of top soil and eventually soil fertility declines in treefall gaps compared to understorey. Soil microbial population was less during periods when temperature and moisture conditions are low, while it peaked during rainy season when the litter decomposition rate is at its peak on the forest floor. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season (the peak vegetative growth period) limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and, therefore, low microbial C, N and P. Weak correlations were also obtained for the relationships between microbial C, N and P and soil physico-chemical properties. Gap size did influence the microbial nutrients and their contribution to soil organic carbon, total Kjeldhal nitrogen and available-P. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic carbon, microbial N to total nitrogen were similar in both treefall gaps and understorey plots, while the contribution of microbial P to soil available-P was lower in gap compared to the understorey. These results indicate that any fluctuation in microbial biomass related nutrient cycling processes in conjunction with the associated microclimate variation may affect the pattern of regeneration of tree seedlings in the gaps and hence be related with their size.

AB The paleoenvironments of late Pleistocene and early Holocene time on the Southern High Plains have been studied for decades, but regionally extensive or long-term, easily recoverable proxy climate indicators are difficult to find. The stratigraphy of valley fill and upland eolian deposits and stable-carbon isotope data, in addition to geographically limited paleontological data, now provide clues to the environment during this time, which includes the earliest, or Paleoindian period (similar to 11,200-8000 C-14 yr B.P.) of human occupation. During the Clovis occupation (similar to 11,200-10,900 C-14 yr B.P.), valleys contained perennial streams. This was followed in Folsom time (10,900-10,200 C-14 yr B.P.) by an abrupt change to lakes and ponds (with water levels fluctuating between several meters depth and no surface water) and marshes and accumulation of sheet sands on uplands, starting the earliest phase of construction of the regional dune fields. These changing conditions indicate a shift from relatively wetter to relatively drier conditions with episodic drought. Stable-C isotopes further indicate that warming characterized the Clovis-Folsom transition. During the rest of the Paleoindian period the environment was relatively cool but fluctuated between wetter and drier conditions with an overall trend toward drying that resulted in further enlargement of the dune fields and culminated in the warm, dry Altithermal beginning similar to 8000 C-14 yr B.P. Clovis time probably was the wettest of any Paleoindian period in terms of runoff and spring discharge. The Folsom period was drier and was the earliest episode of regional wind erosion and eolian deposition and may have been the warmest of Paleoindian times. Evidence of a previously hypothesized "Clovis drought" in this region is sparse. (C) 2000 University of Washington.

AB Cs-137 redistribution in an agricultural watershed in loess formations in hilly areas in the northern part of Iran was determined by collecting undisturbed soil samples on corners of a grid network. The activity of fallout Cs-137 in Bequerel per kilogram (Bq kg(-1)) was determined in soil samples at 662 Kev in gamma spectrum.
   The correlation between Cs137 activity as an indicator of soil erosion and physical and chemical soil properties was assessed in different functions.
   1) A correlation with R-2 = 0.56 was obtained between Cs-137 and the total N in 102 samples. Organic carbon was significantly correlated with both variables, hence the good correlation between Cs-137 and total N.
   2) Correlations between Cs-137, K, Cs-137 and P were significant but R-2 were low.
   3) Cs-137 and AWC and Cs-137 and PWP correlations were significant indicating erosion reduces the available water capacity, likely because of organic carbon.
   4) OC and Cs-137 correlation was statistically significant in 102 samples with R-2 = 0.63 and is defined OC = 7.34 + 0.797 Cs-137 (OC=gr Kg(-1) Cs-137 Bq Kg(-1)).
   5) IN and OC Correlation was significant with R-2 = 0.85 in 102 samples.
   6) FC and OC and PWP correlations were significant but with R-2 Of 0.34 and 0.12 respectively), the slope of the FC and OC function is 2.5 times steeper than the slope of the PWP and OC function indicating the conspicuous effect of OC on AWC of the soil, while this correlation was absent for clay which had 0.29 for the FC and C slope and 0.27 for PWP and C slope without any conspicuous effect on AWC in this experiment. R-2 in multilinear regression between FC, PWP and effective variables (OC,C, Si, S, dgx) was 0.75 and 0.66 in 68 samples. The following functions show that the OC is the most effective variable defining FC and PWP. The slope of the FC and OC function is again 2.5 times steeper than slope of PWP and OC.
   FC = 202.77+3.03 OC + 0.177C -0.69 dgx
   PWP= 95.40+1.23 OC + 0.175C -0.13S
   7) The rate of productivity loss for cotton caused by erosion during 30 years were 327 kg ha(-1) a(-1) according to the Young function and the productivity index after 50 years with current erosion rate will be reduced 34-40% using Pierces PI in four representative profiles in the study area.

AB Particle-reactive nuclides can potentially be used to study the accumulation and/or erosion of soil particles. We have measured the concentrations and inventories of Beryllium-7 in 28 soil profiles (the maximum diffusive mass depth of 5 mm corresponding to an in situ depth of 10 mm). The soil profiles are from different watersheds on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau located on the eastern slope of the Himalayas in different seasons during the years of 1994 and 1995. The results showed that Be-7 activities in all of the soil profiles presented an index decrease with soil depth. Its inventories in the soil profiles varied with the seasons. Be-7 concentration profiles were modeled to determine the seasonal accumulation/erosion rates for soil particles. Cs-137, Ra-226, and Ra-228 distributions in the soils, due to their origins and decay characteristics, are much different from 7Be. The results from two other soil profiles indicated that the maximum diffusive depth of Cs-137 was 30 Cm in situ. Cs-137 activities decreased with soil depth and its inventories varied with changes of eroded and accumulated area.
   The experimental results of geochemical speciation in the soils showed that more than 85% of Be-7, Cs-137, Ra-226, and Ra-228 were bound to organic, Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxide and residual fractions. They can be moved with soil particles and used as tracers for erosion and/or accumulation of soil particles. 7Be geochemical speciation in the soils agreed with its trace for seasonal particle transport. It can be used as a geochemical tracer for seasonal erosion of surface soil. Cs-137 geochemical speciation was suitable for trace of soil particle accumulation as well as sediment dating. Ra-226 and Ra-228 were combined in crystalline skeleton of clay minerals and mainly remain as a residue in the soils and very little was bound to the soluble, exchangeable, carbonate fractions. The differentials of Ra-226/Ra-228 activity ratios in different geochemical speciation in the soils can be used as a parameter to trace accumulation and/or erosion of soil particles.

AB In the interplay of the soil and the atmosphere, the soil can be both a contributor to and a recipient of the impacts of climate change. In the past, land management has generally resulted in considerable depletion of soil organic matter and the release into the atmosphere of such radiatively active gases as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Global climate change, to the extent that it occurs, will strongly impact all soil processes. At this time, the task of soil management should be to restore soil organic carbon in order to enhance soil structure and fertility and to help counter the atmospheric greenhouse effect, Widely varying estimates of the soil's organic carbon content and of the potential for soil carbon sequestration point to the need to conduct a comprehensive inventory of this important property.

ID LOW PH; NITRIFICATION; AMMONIUM; ASSIMILATION
AB Sewage sludge is being applied to alkaline saline soil of the former Lake Texcoco (Mexico) as part of a scheme to vegetate the land and prevent erosion by wind. However, its effect on the microbial functioning of the soil is unknown. We investigated under laboratory conditions the decomposition of sewage sludge and its effect on carbon and nitrogen mineralization and ammonia (NH(3)) volatilization. Soil was sampled from four locations, one undrained and three drained, for 1, 5 and 8 years. The samples were divided into two groups, one of which was amended with sewage sludge, and were aerobically incubated for 70 days at 22 +/- 1 degrees C. The microbial biomass activity in the unamended soil, as indicated by CO(2) production as a percentage of total soil organic C, was inhibited neither by high pH nor by large salt concentrations. Addition of 1.5 g of dry sewage sludge kg(-1) dry soil, equivalent to 200 mg C kg(-1), increased CO(2) production significantly in the soil with the least soil C content and lowest pH, which had been drained for 8 years. It did not influence production of CO(2) in the soil from the other treatments even when 1000 mg sewage sludge C kg(-1) was added. Volatilization of NH(3) increased with soil pH and application of sludge. Concentrations of NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) decreased in the first 7 days and tended to increase again after 28-42 days. We conclude that the microbial activity of the soil was not affected by high pH and salt concentration but the soil was deficient in N. The organic material added with the sewage sludge was sequestered and thus unavailable for microorganisms.

AB Soil erosion, which is a widespread problem in semiarid areas, may lead to a decline in soil productivity since the finest and most fertile soil particles are those which are generally removed. Our objective was to determine the distribution of soil organic matter, phosphorus, potassium and cation exchange capacity within the fine fractions (< 2 mu m and 2-20 mu m) of the soil. Samples were taken from the top 20 cm of 14 cultivated soils and six forest soils. The organo-mineral size fractions from soil samples were isolated without chemical pretreatment by ultrasonic dispersion in water followed by sedimentation-syphonation. The distribution of organic matter within size fractions varied with land use. The cultivated soils had a greater percentage (on average, about 30%) of total soil C in the < 2 mu m fraction than the soils under natural vegetation (on average, about 18%), in which the total soil C was associated with the 2-20 mu m fraction to a greater extent than in cultivated soils. The distribution of the soil N between the clay and fine silt size fractions followed a similar pattern to that shown by soil C. The C/N ratio became smaller as particle size decreased. The higher C/N ratio obtained for the 2-20 mu m fraction for both forest and cultivated soils suggests the presence of less decomposed organic matter, while the organic matter associated with the < 2 mu m fraction can be considered to be more humified. The cation exchange capacity of whole soil and organo-mineral fractions were closely correlated with their respective C contents. The clay-size fraction had the highest CEC, which was related to its mineralogical composition.
   The data confirm that the proportion of soil organic matter depends on the stabilizing capacity of the different size fractions, both the clay and fine silt size fractions playing an important role in semiarid soils. To the detriment of the soil's organic matter content these fractions are easily eroded in soils under arid and semiarid conditions, which may render them suitable for agricultural purposes.

AB Links between erosion/sedimentation history and soil carbon cycling were examined in a highly erosive setting in Mississippi loess soils. We sampled soils on (relatively) undisturbed and cropped hillslopes and measured C, N, C-14, and CO2 flux to characterize carbon storage and dynamics and to parameterize Century and spreadsheet C-14 models for different erosion and tillage histories, For this site, where 100 years of intensive cotton cropping were followed by fertilization and contour plowing, there was an initial and dramatic decline in soil carbon content from 1870 to 1950, followed by a dramatic increase in soil carbon. Soil erosion amplifies C loss and recovery: About 100% of the original, prehistoric soil carbon was likely lost over 127 years of intensive land use, but about 30% of that carbon was replaced after 1950. The eroded cropland was therefore a local sink for CO2 since the 1950s. However, a net CO2 sink requires a full accounting of eroded carbon, which in turn requires that decomposition rates in lower slopes or wetlands be reduced to about 20% of the upland value. As a result, erosion may induce unaccounted sinks or sources of CO2, depending on the fate of eroded carbon and its protection from decomposition. For erosion rates typical of the United States, the sink terms may be large enough (1 Gt yr(-1), back-of-the-envelope) to warrant a careful accounting of site management, cropping, and fertilization histories, as well as burial rates, for a more meaningful global assessment.

AB Although approximately 1.3 million ha of mixed Solonetzic - Chemozemic landscapes are cultivated in Saskatchewan, little information is available on the effects that agriculture has had on the quality of these soils. At bur research site in southwestern Saskatchewan a clear landscape-scale pattern of soil distribution occurred. Regosolic and thin Chernozemic soils were associated with the long, gentle (2-5%) slopes and Solonetzic-influenced soils were associated with higher catchment area footslope and depressional positions. High rates of soil loss occurred throughout the landscape - overall a net soil loss of 31 Mg ha yr(-1) was calculated using Cs-137 redistribution techniques. No net depositional sires were observed in the 45 sampling points in the landscape, suggesting that the site was dominated by wind erosion. The high rates of loss were consistent with very low levels of soil organic carbon storage (37 to 46 Mg ha(-1) to 45 cm) at all slope positions in the landscape and with the occurrence of sub-soil features in the plough layer. The Solonetzic-influenced soils occupy 38% of the site and have high sodium adsorption ratios (from 18 to 38 in the B horizon) and high soil resistance values as determined with a penetrometer. For the Solonetz and Solodized Solonetz soils these growth-limiting properties occur immediately below the 10-cm plough layer and may constitute a largely irreversible decrease in their productive capacity.

AB Crop residues left on the soil surface after harvest are effective in reducing erosion; however, when subjected to rainfall-leaching, the residues are a significant source of soluble nutrients to agricultural runoff. Nutrient teaching from crop residues as a function of rainfall intensity, and residue loading rate, was studied in a series of laboratory experiments under controlled conditions. Using a multiple-intensity rainfall simulator corn (Zea mays L.) stover placed on a nylon screen at an equivalent field loading rate of 10 t ha(-1): was subjected to simulated rainfall at intensities of 6, 12, 25, 51, and 99 mm h(-1). In another series of experiments, simulated rainfall was applied at 25 mm h(-1) to four stover loading rates of 5, 7, 10, and 15 t ha(-1). In both experiments, leachate was sampled as a function of time and analyzed for PO4-P, NH4-N, NO3-N, and total organic carbon (TOC). Nutrient concentrations and losses were generally greater at the lower rainfall intensities and higher stover loading rates. In each study, nutrient concentrations decreased hyperbolically with either time or cumulative leachate volume. For all loading rates and rainfall intensities, nutrient amounts (kg ha(-1)) leached from the stover followed the order C >>N = P; however, the amounts of N as (NH4-N + NO3-N) or C leached were less than or equal to 1.5% of total nutrient in residue compared with 2.8 to 6.0% of fetal nutrient in residue for P. Stover exposed to field conditions over time showed leaching kinetics similar to freshly collected residues.

AB Improvement in soil quality to maintain high production and reduce negative environmental impacts is necessary for alternative crop production strategies to become socially acceptable and viable in the long-term. No-tillage (NT) management of the predominantly small grain region of western Canada has the potential to curb soil erosion and increase profitability. An understanding of the direct effects of NT on soil properties is necessary to evaluate its potential for sustained long-term productivity. We have compiled data collected from two sites in northern British Columbia to ascertain the long-term effects of conventional tillage (CT) and NT on soil components thought to be important in surface soil structural improvement. Soil water retention was greater under NT compared with CT without dramatically altering bulk density due to redistribution of pore size classes into more small pores and less large pores. Soil organic C was greater under NT than under CT nearest the soil surface. Water-stable aggregation improved under NT compared with CT, perhaps because more soil organic C was sequestered within macroaggregates under NT compared with CT that helped to stabilize these aggregates. Steady-state water infiltration was greater under NT than under CT as a result of soil structural improvements associated with surface residue accumulation and lack of soil disturbance. Barley (Hordeum vulgave L.) yield tended to be greater under NT than under CT in years of low rainfall as a result of improvements in soil water retention and transmission that may have provided a better environment for root development. Our data indicate that NT is a viable management strategy to improve soil quality in the cold, semiarid region of western Canada. This strategy could lead to high production, minimal negative environmental impacts, acid a socially-acceptable farming system. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil erosion can adversely influence soil quality, especially in tropical soils. Thus, a multi-location field experiment was conducted on eight major agricultural soils with different degrees of erosion, in three eco-regions in Tanzania. The objective was to assess the impact of topsoil depth (TSD) and management on soil properties. Three eco-regions comprising of humid at Kilimanjaro, sub-humid at Tanga and sub-humid/semi-arid at Morogoro were selected. There were a total of eight locations within three eco-regions comprising two at Kilimanjaro (e.g., Kirima Bore and Xeno Helena), two at Tanga (Mlingano 1 and Mlingano 2) and four at Morogoro (Misufini 1, Misufini 2, Misufini 3, and Mindu). The soil management treatments consisted of farmyard manure (FYM), N and P fertilizer, tie-ridging and farmers' practice. Plant nutrient content was generally lowest on severely eroded and the highest on least eroded soil classes. Soil pH decreased with increasing severity of erosion on soils with higher content of Ca(+2) in the sub-surface. In general, there occurred a decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) and P with the decrease in TSD. The SOC content decreased on severely eroded soil class by 0.16%, 0.39% and 0.13% at Misufini 1, Mlingano 1 and Kirima Bore, respectively, compared to slightly or least eroded soil class. Corresponding decline in available P at these sites was 41%, 62% and 61%, respectively. Application of FYM significantly increased soil pH at some sites. Soil content of SOC, N, P, K and Mg were significantly increased by FYM application. Significant effects of N and P fertilizers on SOC and P were observed at most sites. In comparison with farmer's practice, FYM application increased SOC by 0.55%, N by 0.03%, P by six fold and K by two-fold. Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers had comparable effects for SOC and P only at some sites. The results indicate that FYM is a better soil input than N and P fertilizers in improving soil quality. The data show that SOC, N and P are most adversely affected with accelerated erosion and that FYM fertilizer applications have the potential to improve fertility of eroded soils.

TI Effects of different land management techniques on selected topsoil
   properties of a forest Ferralsol
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH

AB Soil erosion is a major threat for Ferralsols in Cameroon. The influence of traditional intercropping (TI), disk-harrow ploughing (DH), no-tillage (NT), and Wischmeier bare fallow (BF) on runoff coefficient, soil loss, organic carbon (OC) content and bulk density was evaluated in topsoils of a forest Ferralsol in Yaounde region, Central Cameroon, using erosion plots. This was to ensure the best conditions for the determination of the soil properties to be assessed. After two years of cropping, the mean runoff coefficient remained very low for TI (<2% of the rain) as compared with NT (14%) and DH (15%). The same held true for soil loss which was in the order of 2, 68 and 109 Mg ha(-1) for TI, NT, and DH respectively, and bulk density which was 1.06, 1.18 and 1.21 Mg m(-3) respectively. Comparing the latter with the measurements obtained from BF (1.23 Mg m(-3)) and the adjacent secondary forest (SF) (1.04 Mg m(-3)) showed that the disk-harrow treatment was the most degraded among the three. The same comparison was made for the OC content. It was found that while in SE OC was as high as 30 g kg(-1), it was only 11, 13, 15 and 18 g kg(-1) in BE DH, TI, and NT respectively. On the average and for the time frame considered, TI adversely affected topsoil properties less than NT, DH and BF in this order. Based on the above, it can be concluded that TI is more conservative than the three other land management techniques investigated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The overall effects of fire on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground, recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions and processes. Depending on several fire severity measures, changes in belowground components can be either beneficial or deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a herbaoeous flora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin overcrowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe fires can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients and ash entrainment in smoke columns, produce rapid or decreased mineralization rates, alter C : N ratios, and result in subsequent nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or denitrification. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning, degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated processes can occur. The direct effect of fire on belowground systems is a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures, and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use practices. Thus, the impacts of fire on belowground systems can be highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general review of the effects of fire on belowground systems with emphasis placed on the changes in physical. biogeochemical and biological properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have for ecosystem sustainability.

AB A three-year field trial on an upland loessial soil (Belmont silt loam) in New Zealand investigated the effects of ripping, application of fertilizer N and grazing management on the recovery of some physical, chemical and biochemical properties of soil and pasture productivity following removal (mining) of topsoil. Removing the top 31 cm of soil by mining (all of the A horizon and part of the AB horizon) also removed most of the soil's labile organic matter fractions, and to a lesser extent its total organic matter. After three years, the microbial C and mineralizable N in the 0-10 cm depth of mined soil had reached 65 and 62 per cent of the corresponding levels in unmined soil. Ripping to a depth of 30 cm, application of fertilizer N and lenient grazing of the pasture failed to enhance the recovery of soil fertility. A soil sampling depth of 20 cm provided a reasonable basis to assess the microbial biomass and potential fertility. Pasture productivity was, on average, 30 per cent lower on mined land than on unmined land over the first three years after mining. Application of N proved uneconomic in terms of farm production, although a good pasture response to N fertilizer was obtained. The results from this and related trials are summarized as a series of recommendations for the monitoring and regulation of topsoil mining. An incentive regime is also recommended to encourage land owners and/or topsoil miners to use successful restoration techniques on topsoil-mined land. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Change in frequency and intensity of tillage practices alters the soil properties, distribution of nutrients, and soil organic matter in the soil profile. We hypothesized that 8 yr of no-till (NT), chisel plow (CP), and moldboard plow (MP) treatments mould affect chemical properties and organic matter of eroded soil. The corn (Zen mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation study was established in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L.) sod on a previously eroded, moderately well-drained, Grantsburg (Fine-silty, mixed, mesic Oxyaquic Fragiudalf) soil in southern Illinois. In the eighth year, soil pH, exchangeable Ca, and Bray P-1 were greater in NT than in CP and MP in the 0- to 5-cm soil depth. In the 0- to 5-cm soil depth, exchangeable K and Mg were greater with the CP than with the NT and MP. In the 5- to 15-cm soil depth, exchangeable Ca and Mg were greater in the MP and CP than in NT, due to mixing. Soil pH and P were greater for CP than MP and NT in the 5- to 15-cm layer. Exchangeable K in the 5- to 15-cm soil depth was greater in the MP than CP and NT. In the 0- to 5-cm soil depth, NT, CP, and MP had 38, 35, and 31% of their total C as particulate organic matter (POM), respectively. After 8 yr, CP and MP had less total organic C than NT in the 0- to 5-cm depth. In the 0- to 5-cm depth, CP and MP had less POM C than NT. The greater reduction of organic C in the POM fraction than in whole soil showed that POM was the most tillage-sensitive fraction of organic matter. After 8 yr of study, the water-stable aggregates in the 0- to 5-cm soil depth of MP and CP was reduced compared with NT. The effects of tillage treatment and associated soil erosion either resulted in different findings from tillage treatments on uneroded soil or affected the trend and magnitude of the soil property differences between treatments. For the 10-yr period prior to the establishment of the tillage experiment the site was managed as hay-land. At:the end of 8 yr, the NT maintained or improved nutrient retention and aggregate stability in the 0- to 5-cm laver compared with MP and CP.

AB The fate and persistence of PCBs 28, 52, 101, 138, and 180 artificially introduced into three soils was studied under a variety of field conditions for up to 415 d following initial contamination. A relationship was detected between In K(oa) (octanol/air partition coefficient) and the experimentally observed first-order loss rate constant that was statistically significant at at least the 90% level in all but one instance. In nearly all experiments. PCB persistence was greater in soils of higher organic carbon content. Soil temperature and moisture content were also indicated as important influences on persistence. Significantly longer half-lives were observed in a soil in which initial PCB contamination had occurred ca. 1 year previously. A mass balance showed the most likely mechanism of loss to be volatilisation. Losses attributable to aerobic biodegradation could not be ruled out, but those due to leaching, uptake by biota, and soil erosion were demonstrated to be negligible. First-order rate constants (k(v)) were determined for volatilisation of the same congeners from soil under a variety of controlled laboratory scenarios. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) showed the most important influences on k(v), to be in K(oa) (adjusted for soil temperature) and soil organic carbon content. Limited evidence was observed for a relationship between k(v) and soil moisture content, but not water flux. When tested against held measurements, the MLRA-derived relationship between k(v) and independent variables predicted to within a factor of 2.5, the persistence of PCBs 28, 52, and 101. However, it did not account for the influence of the age of contaminant association with the soil, soil moisture content or water flux, and failed to function for soils of high organic content, or where In K(oa) exceeds ca. 23.

AB Every production practice, including conservation tillage, has positive or negative environmental consequences that may involve air, land, water, and/or the health and ecological status of wildlife. The negative impacts associated with agricultural production, and the use of conventional tillage systems in particular, include soil erosion, energy use, leaching and runoff of agricultural chemicals, and carbon emissions. Several of these impacts are quantified. The conclusions suggest that the use of conservation tillage does result in less of an adverse impact on the environment from agricultural production than does conventional tillage by reducing surface water runoff and wind erosion. Additionally, wildlife habitat will be enhanced to some extent with the adoption of conservation tillage and the benefits to be gained from carbon sequestration will depend on the soil remaining undisturbed. Finally, further expansion of conservation tillage on highly erodible land will unquestionably result in an increase in social benefits, but the expected gains will be modest.

AB Potential C and N mineralization and soil microbial biomass C were determined following disturbance (i.e. drying and sieving) pretreatments in five soils varying in texture (30-350 mg clay g(-1) soil) from the southern Piedmont USA. Soil disturbance by drying (i.e. rewetting following drying at 55 degrees C for 72 h) of intact soil cores resulted in a hush of C mineralization (70% to 2.5-fold greater) during 0-3 d of incubation, but was not significantly different during 3-10 and 10-24 d periods compared with field-moist-intact soil cores. Soil disturbance by sieving resulted in greater C mineralization earlier than later in the incubation and led to significant immobilization of N of surface soil where respiration was highest. Increasing soil disturbance through smaller sieve openings resulted in a 10-60% greater flush of C mineralization that may have been due to disruption of macroaggregates, which protected soil organic C. With a conditioning period of 10 d following rewetting of dried soil, soil microbial biomass C was unaffected by drying or extent of sieving. Soil texture (i.e. clay content) did not interact with disturbance effects. Immobilization of N was predominant in surface sails (0-40 mm) of this bermudagrass pasture, where mineralizable C was very high. Carbon mineralization during 0-3 d was highly related (r(2) = 0.96 +/- 0.04) to C mineralization during 0-24 d, basal soil respiration and soil microbial biomass C, although increasing soil disturbance (i.e. drying and extent of sieving) altered these relationships in a predictable manner. I conclude that dried and coarsely sieved soil compares favorably to field-moist-intact soil cores for estimating soil microbial biomass and potential activity in landscapes scoured by various degrees of erosion.

AB Sustaining soil fertility under agricultural intensification and expansion onto marginal lands is a significant challenge in the Nepalese Middle Mountains. In a detailed watershed study it was shown that the overall soil fertility is poor, forest soils display the poorest conditions as a result of biomass removal, and sustaining agriculture is questionable due to the transformation from traditional to multiple cropping systems. Parent material is a significant factor influencing low phosphorus status while insufficient inputs create deficiencies in total carbon, nitrogen and bases. A nutrient budget model was developed to assess inputs, redistribution and losses relative to soil fertility Yield, input and management data obtained from farm interviews, and soil analysis data were used in the calculation of nutrient budgets. Results from modelling indicate declining soil fertility under rainfed agriculture, forest and rangelands, and marginal conditions under irrigated agriculture subject to intensive cultivation. Nutrient deficits were relatively low for irrigated rice-wheat systems, which benefit from nutrient inputs via sediments and irrigation waters, but the introduction of triple cropping showed greater deficits. Nutrient balances were most critical under rainfed maize production where 94% of the farms were in deficit. Current shortages of organic matter make elimination of nutrient deficits problematic but improvement of composting, biological N-fixation and fertilizer efficiency and reducing erosion were found to be potential options.

AB Some typical features of soil organic matter dynamics and soil texture were studied to discuss the particular spatial pattern of tiger bush in Niger and its dynamics. The soil texture through silt and clay contents showed a high variability in the vegetation are as well as in the bare area. These variations were clearly linked to water/wind erosion and termite activity. Tiger bush soils showed a high capacity to store soil organic matter despite a moderate primary production, even in the bare area where the input of plant debris has been nil for many decades. The carbon content was higher within the vegetation are (0.93%) than within the bare area (0.45%). Additionally, potential carbon mineralisation significantly varied in relation to the total carbon content and thus to primary production. Then, the vegetation arcs can be viewed as 'fertility islands' as in many arid ecosystems. The measurements of delta(13)C showed a dominant contribution of C-3 plants to the soil organic matter pool. Nevertheless, the contribution of C-4 plants was not negligible. Two hypotheses could be proposed: a different mineralisation rate between C-3 and C-4 plants; or (ii) a better physical protection of C-4 compounds against biodegradation. The soil variables depending totally or partly on biological factors, such as carbon and nitrogen contents, carbon isotopic composition, carbon potential mineralisation, did not show any symmetry in their variations along the studied transects. It was expected in the vegetation are because the vegetation cover does not show symmetry in its specific composition and spatial structure. In the bare area, a clear asymmetry was observed on some of the variables: carbon content, fine material content and natural abundance of C-13. This supports the hypothesis that the vegetation arcs move upslope, and weakens the hypothesis of the alternance of contraction and spreading periods of the vegetation cover. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

AB (U-234/U-238) and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratios, as well as major and trace (U, Ba, Sr, Rb) element concentrations were analyzed in dissolved loads of the Strengbach stream (Vosges, France) in order to constrain the sources of U isotopes (U-234-U-238) to river waters. The variations of the (U-234/U-238) activity ratios along the stream indicate a clear dependence between the (U-234/U-238) activity ratios of the surface waters and the different types of rocks forming the watershed, with near equilibrium values for the waters draining granites and high (U-234/U-238) disequilibria (1.4) for those flowing over carbonates. The high (U-234/U-238) disequilibria are related to a supply of U-234-enriched groundwaters located within the carbonate rocks. The (U-234/U-238) activity ratios of the waters at the outlet of the catchment collecting the sources of the stream on the granitic lithology, decrease from 1.02 to 0.96 when the discharge of the stream increases. Such a tendency requires mixing between a water body enriched in U-234 which weathered the granitic bed rock at secular equilibrium, and a water with a (U-234/U-238) activity ratio below unity representing a mobilization of U from material that has already been weathered. Comparison of the geochemical characteristics of waters collected during the year and those collected during a flood event, reveals the involvement of two different "weathered" end-members, depending on the hydrological conditions: during the year, the dissolved U transported by the river originates from bed-rock and deep horizons of the weathering profile, whereas a significant part of U, during the flood event, is supplied by superficial horizons of soils, probably complexed by organic colloids. These results outline the potential of (U-234/U-238) activity ratios to investigate hydrological processes and emphasize that their use as tracers of rock weathering should be made cautiously.

AB Atmospheric CO2 is consumed both by organic matter formation and chemical rock weathering, and subsequently discharged as dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and dissolved inorganic carbon to the oceans by rivers. In the long term, varying the ratio of the amount of atmospheric CO2 consumed by continental erosion and the amount of CO2 released during carbonate precipitation and organic matter respiration in the oceans can change the CO2 content in the atmosphere. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether riverine organic carbon fluxes during the last glacial maximum (LGM) may have been different from today in order to assess the potential impact on atmospheric CO2. Previous studies mainly focused on the role of the river fluxes of inorganic carbon in this respect, but none of them examined possible variations in the fluxes of organic carbon, although the erosion of organic carbon actually represents the bulk of the atmospheric CO2 consumption by continental erosion. We therefore applied a global carbon erosion model to a LGM scenario in order to determine the riverine fluxes of organic matter during that time. The climatic conditions during the LGM were reconstructed using a computer simulation with a general circulation model. It is found that during the LGM the riverine organic carbon input into the oceans was at least similar to 10% lower than today. Most of the reduction of the total organic matter fluxes is due to the reduction of the fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. The fluxes of particulate organic carbon remained almost unchanged. The oceanic response to the lower carbon input was estimated on the basis of a present-day steady state budget for organic river carbon in the oceans, and implies that the reduction of the river fluxes were more than counterbalanced by lower burial rates due to the smaller shelf area during the LGM. This suggests that both the lower river carbon input and the relatively greater share of this carbon being subjected to oceanic respiration, acted as a negative feedback to the low atmospheric CO2 content during the LGM.

SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL

ID EROSION; CARBON; YIELDS
AB Crop productivity under dryland conditions is largely limited by soil water availability. Soil organic matter (SOM) contents have been found to be a reliable index of crop productivity in semiarid regions because if positively affects soil water-holding capacity, Our objectives were to explain differences in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in response to SOM levels and related properties and to quantify the contribution of a unit increment of SOM content to soil productivity during 1991, 1992, and 1994 on a total of 134 production fields in the semiarid Argentine Pampas, Wheat yields were related to both soil water retention and total organic C (TOC) contents in the top layers (0-20 cm) in years with low moisture availability (1992 [r = 0.51, P < 0.01] and 1994 [r = 0.59, P < 0.01]), and mere related to both fetal N and available P contents in a year without water deficit stress (1991 [r = 0.58, P < 0.01]), Wheat yields over all years were linearly related to TOC (r = 0.68, P < 0.01) when these contents were <175 g kg(-1). Dependence of wheal yields on soil water retention and on TOC contents under water deficit was related to. the positive effect of these soil components on plant-available water. In the absence of water deficit (1991), nutrient availability was the limiting factor, Losses of 1 Mg SOM ha(-1) were associated with a decrease in wheat yield of approximately 40 kg ha(-1) These results demonstrate the importance of using cultural practices that minimize losses of soil organic C in the semiarid Argentine Pampas.

ID SOIL
AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) population densities on the chemical and microbiological properties of an Oxisol. The work was carried out on soil samples of 0-20 cm depth originated from an experimental site which had been used for coffee tree spacing studies during 15 years, in Parana State, Brazil. Eight coffee tree populations were evaluated: 7143, 3571, 2381, 1786, 1429, 1190, 1020, and 893 trees/ha. Increasing plant population increased soil pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, extractable P, organic carbon, moisture content and coffee root colonization by vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and decreased exchangeable Al and microbial biomass. Such results were attributed to better erosion control, improved plant residue management and nutrient cycling, and decreased leaching losses. Increasing coffee tree population per unit of area has shown to be an important reclamation recuperation strategy for improving fertility of the acid soils in Parana, Brazil.

AB The stability of soil aggregates against water erosion is a largely unstudied factor in research on the spatially-distributed impacts of tropical forestry. Soil strata with particularly weak aggregates are likely to be the focus for erosional activity whether buried or exposed by either natural processes or forestry activities. Understanding the location and likely cause of such intrinsic instability would, therefore, allow better spatially-distributed parameterisation of erosion models. This study has aimed to identify the range in aggregate stability within a region of Bornean Ultisol disturbed by forestry operations, and to identify the bulk soil properties associated with such stability variations. The sites sampled were subject to a range of denudational processes including piping, rilling and landslide-triggered erosion. Soil profiles with rates of erosion in excess of 10 mm a(-1) were shown to have less aggregate stability (as characterised by the rainfall simulation survival index (RSSI)) than those with no visible signs of erosion. Further, large differences in aggregate stability between soil horizons of the same profile were observed and seen to be statistically correlated with the bulk soil properties of organic carbon and clay content (i.e. stabilising agents) and the dispersing agent of exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) at sites undergoing erosion. Organic carbon appeared to be the most important governing factor, accounting for 56% of the variance in the aggregate stability. The presence of strongly and weakly expanding 2 : 1 clays within the soils may have been an additional de-stabilising factor. Reduced porosity was also observed at eroding sites with weak soil aggregates. The properties of EC25 and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were not correlated with the RSSI or the presence of soil erosion, Identification of the role of organic carbon, clay and ESP in the stability of these tropical forest aggregates is important in focusing future, more intensive research on the spatial parameterisation of models to simulate forestry impacts on erosion.

AB In Canada and the United States approximately 82% of the annual total dose of radiation to any person comes from terrestrial and cosmogenic sources. The soil is also the main source of radon exposure to humans. Therefore it is important to know the background levels of natural and anthropogenic radioactivity in soils. In this study the radionuclides K-40, Ra-226, Th-232 and (CS)-C-137 were measured in the soils of southwestern Ontario in order to determine the background levels and to understand the soil profile distribution. Clay content is the most important variable affecting the background levels of K-40, Ra-226, and Th-232 in the soil. The profile distribution of these radionuclides is further influenced by pedogenic processes, particularly carbonate leaching from the solum and clay illuviation from the Ae to the Bt horizons. The lateral and vertical distribution of bomb-fallout Cs-137 is influenced by soil management such as tillage, biopedoturbation by soil animals such as earthworms and groundhogs, soil erosion and soil organic matter cycling. Multiple regression analysis showed that clay content, sand content, percent CaCO3, pH and organic carbon content had variable influences on each of the radionuclide contents in the soil.

TI Spatial and short-term temporal variations in runoff, soil aggregation
   and other soil properties along a Mediterranean climatological gradient

DT Correction
AB Physical and chemical soil properties were measured along a mountainous climatological gradient in the province of Alicante (Spain), The objective was to evaluate how the climate affects certain soil properties at different temporal and spatial scales. These properties include infiltration, runoff and sediment concentrations resulting from rainfall simulation experiments performed in winter and in summer. Chemical soil properties like carbonate content, organic matter content and CEC were analysed in reference soil profiles along the gradient. Physical soil properties like soil moisture content, macroaggregation and waterstable microaggregation were measured at monthly intervals during a year, The comparison of the results was done at different spatial (site, slope and patch) and temporal (monthly and seasonal) scales by means of some statistical tests, It can be concluded that there are some soil properties positively related to the gradient, like organic matter, clay content and CEC which increase with the annual rainfall. However, runoff coefficients and erosion are higher when the climatic conditions become more arid, Aggregation and infiltration capacity are higher on north-facing slopes and in vegetated patches than in south-facing slopes and in bare patches.

TI Widespread bacterial populations at glacier beds and their relationship

SO GEOLOGY

AB Bacterial populations found in subglacial meltwaters and basal ice are comparable to those in the active layer of permafrost and orders of magnitude larger than those found in ice cores from large ice sheets. Populations increase with sediment concentration, and 5%-24% of the bacteria are dividing or have just divided, suggesting that the populations are active. These findings (1) support inferences from recent studies of basal ice and meltwater chemistry that microbially mediated redox reactions may be important at glacier beds, (2) challenge the view that chemical weathering in glacial environments arises from purely inorganic reactions, and (3) raise the possibilities that redox reactions are a major source of protons consumed in subglacial weathering and that these reactions may be the dominant proton source beneath ice sheets where meltwaters are isolated from an atmospheric source of CO2. Microbial mediation may increase the rate of sulfide oxidation under subglacial conditions, a suggestion supported by the results of simple weathering experiments. If subglacial bacterial populations can oxidize and ferment organic carbon, it is important to reconsider the fate of soil organic carbon accumulated under interglacial conditions in areas subsequently overridden by Pleistocene ice sheets.

AB Climatic and environmental changes during the Younger Dryas stadial (GS-1) and preceding and following transitions are inferred from stable carbon and oxygen isotope records obtained from the sediments of ancient Lake Torreberga, southern Sweden. Event GS-1 is represented in the sediment sequence by 3.5 m of clay containing lacustrine carbonates of various origins. Comparison of isotopic records obtained on mollusc shells, ostracod valves, and Chara encrustations precipitated during specific seasons of the year supports estimates of relative changes in both lake water and mean annual air temperatures. Variations in soil erosion rates can also be estimated from a simple isotope-mass-balance model to separate allochthonous and autochthonous carbonate contributions to the bulk carbonate content of the sediments. The well-known, rapid climatic shifts characterising the Last Termination in the North Atlantic region are clearly reflected in the isotopic data, as well as longer-term changes within GS-1. Following maximum cooling shortly after the Allerod-Younger Dryas (GI-1-GS-1) transition, a progressive warming and a slight increase in aquatic productivity is indicated. At the Younger Dryas-Preboreal (GS-1-PB) transition mean annual air temperature rapidly increased by more than 5 degrees C and summer lake-water temperature increased by ca. 12 degrees C. The subsequent Preboreal oscillation is characterised by an increase in soil erosion and a slight decrease in mean annual air temperature. These results are in harmony with recent findings about large-scale climate dynamics during the Last Termination. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Chemical and physical degradation of Red Ferrosols in eastern Australia is a major issue necessitating the development of more sustainable cropping systems. This paper derives critical concentrations of the active (permanganate-oxidisable) fraction of soil organic matter (C1) which maximise soil water recharge and minimise the likelihood of surface runoff in these soils.
   Ferrosol soils were collected from commercial properties in both north and south Queensland, while additional data were made available from a similar collection of Tasmanian Ferrosols. Sites represented a range of management histories, from grazed and ungrazed grass pastures to continuously cropped soil under various tillage systems. The concentration of both total carbon (C) and C1 varied among regions and farming systems.
   C1 was the primary factor controlling aggregate breakdown, measured by the percentage of aggregates <0.125 mm (P125) in the surface crust after simulated rainfall. The rates of change in P125 per unit change in C1 were not significantly different (P < 0.05) for soils from the different localities. However, soils from the coastal Burnett (south-east Queensland) always produced lower P125 (i.e. less aggregate breakdown) than did soils from the inland Burnett and north Queensland locations given the same concentration of C1. This difference was not associated with a particular land use.
   The 'critical' concentrations of C1 for each region were taken as the C1 concentrations that would allow an infiltration rate greater than or equal to the intensity of a 1 in 1 or 1 in 10 year frequency rainfall event of 30 min duration. This analysis also provided an indication of the risk associated with the concentrations of C1 currently characterising each farming system in each rainfall environment. None of the conventionally tilled Queensland Ferrosols contained sufficient C1 to cope with rainfall events expected to occur with a 1 in 10 frequency, while in many situations the C1 concentration was sufficiently low that runoff events would be expected on an annual basis.
   Our data suggest that management practices designed both to maximise C inputs and to maintain a high proportion of active C should be seen as essential steps towards developing a more sustainable cropping system.

AB This paper presents an analysis of how energy crop cultivations in Sweden, consisting of short-rotation forest (Salix) and energy grass (reed canary grass), can be located and managed to maximise environmental benefits. The overall conclusion is that substantial environmental benefits, ranging from global to site-specific, could be achieved when traditional annual food crops produced with current agriculture practices are replaced by dedicated perennial energy crops. The emission of greenhouse gases could be reduced by reduced carbon dioxide emissions from organic soils, by reduced nitrous oxide emissions caused by the use of fertilisers and through accumulation of soil carbon in mineral soils? which also leads to increased soil fertility. Nutrient leaching could be reduced by using energy crop cultivations as buffer strips along open streams and wind erosion could be reduced by using Salix plantations as shelter belts. Cultivation of Salix and energy grass can also be used to purify municipal waste, such as waste water, landfill leachate, and sewage sludge. Furthermore, the content of heavy metals in the soil can be reduced through Salix cultivation. The biodiversity is estimated to be almost unchanged, or slightly increased in open farmland. These environmental benefits, which could be achieved on up to 60% of current Swedish arable land and last for 25 years or more, will increase the value of the energy crops. The economic value of these benefits is calculated in Part II of the analysis, which is presented in a second paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the Rougiers de Camares area (in the south of France), hillslopes are very susceptible to water erosion. This is the result of physical features (steep slopes, soft bedrocks, thin soils), climatic aggressiveness (frost, storms), as well as farming systems (intensive tillage, short crop cycles, land consolidation). The objective of this work was to study the relationships between soil erodibility, macroaggregate stability, and carbon content of surface samples (0-10 cm), in a Rougiers Entisol (Lithic Udorthent) under various management practices (flat or raised moldboard ploughing, superficial tillage, direct drilling, with inputs in the form of mineral fertilizers or sheep manure). The soil erodibility was assessed by field rainfall simulation (60 mm h(-1)) on manually retilled bare dry soil; water-stable macroaggregation (>0.2 mm) was assessed by wet-sieving, after immersion in water. Runoff, turbidity and soil losses were linked to water-stable macroaggregation and carbon content in the 0-10 cm layer. During the first 30 minutes of rainfall, runoff and soil losses were closely correlated with topsoil initial water-stable macroaggregation, but not with topsoil carbon content (although there was a correlation between water-stable macroaggregation and carbon content). At the end of the rain (runoff steady state), turbidity and soil losses were closely correlated with topsoil carbon content, and to a lesser extent, with water-stable macroaggregation. Water-stable macroaggregation (which prevents crusting) and carbon content (which has an effect upon liquidity limit, among others) were thus important determining factors of erodibility for the studied soil. The influence of management practices on soil erodibility was therefore dependent upon their effects on these factors.

AB The Permian-Triassic boundary in the Sydney Basin of Australia is coincident with a pronounced decrease in delta(13)C isotopic values of organic carbon, the last coals anywhere in the world for all of the Early Triassic (ca. 6 m.y.) time, and extirpation of the Glossopteris flora at the top of the Illawarra and Newcastle Coal Measures. Coal-bearing paleosols of the latest Permian represent extensive swamplands of the seasonally deciduous Glossopteris nora in a humid cold temperate lowland southwest of an Andean-style volcanic arc. Stone-rolls (large ribs of floor rock up into the coal) within some of the uppermost coals of the Permian coal measures can be interpreted as string bogs of a kind now found in cold climates at latitudes of 68 degrees-70 degrees, which is compatible with a paleomagnetically estimated paleolatitude of 65 degrees-85 degrees S for the Sydney Basin. Paleolatitude was not much different for earliest Triassic time, but paleosols of that age include Inceptisols and Entisols showing substantial chemical and textural weathering, more like soils now forming at latitudes of 40 degrees-58 degrees than those within polar circles. This anomalous high-latitude warmth set in at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Sedimentation rates increased at the boundary marked by geochemically unusual acidification of clay and a dramatic carbon isotopic excursion. These changes in environments and ecosystems can be explained by soil erosion following deforestation implied by the plant extinctions and abundant fungal remains at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Evidence from paleosols can now be added to that from paleontological and isotopic studies showing that disruption of the carbon cycle at the Permian-Triassic boundary resulted in a CO(2) or CH(4) post-apocalyptic greenhouse paleoclimate.

AB CRP lands in eastern Washington were eligible for dryland cropping production as of 1995. Conservation and conventional take-put practices were assessed at eight sites throughout eastern Washington to determine changes in soil quality parameters. The trials tested different tillage options: direct-seed/spring plant (DSP), conventional tillage/spring take-out (CSP), or conventional tillage/summer fallow (CSF). The eastern Washington sites range in annual precipitation from 23 to 36 cm (?? to ?? in) and in soil organic matter from 1.06 to 2.60%. Microbial biomass, readily-mineralized carbon (RMC), dehydrogenase activity, pH, organic matter content (OM), nitrate and ammonium concentrations, moisture, bulk density, and aggregate stability were monitored from 1995 to 1996. Results showed that RMC and pH were lower after one year in conventionally-tilled plots as compared to CRP grassland. The direct-seed samples were more like CRP grassland with respect to pH, dehydrogenase activity, and RMC than conventional tillage treatments.

AB Accurate knowledge of soil hydraulic properties is of crucial importance for reliable applications of recently developed distributed models to environmental studies and land-use planning. Use of computer models to simulate water flow and solute transport processes or to assess the hydrological response of an agricultural catchment requires non only the determination of the soil hydraulic properties in a large number of points within the area of interest, but also a detailed characterization of the spatial variability exhibited by these properties. The scope of this study is to correlate the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties with the distribution of soils in the landscape.
   The experimental work was conducted in the Sauro River catchment, the main tributary of the Agri River (Basilicata Region, Italy). This catchment is located within the middle Agri valley and represents an interesting area for site-specific studies on surface erosion and land degradation. The sampled area is a hillslope oriented in the N-S direction. Undisturbed soil samples were collected from the surface layer of soil at 100 sites, spaced 50 m apart, along a 5-km long transect parallel to the main slope, ell soil cores were subjected to laboratory measurements to determine bulk density, particle density, particle-size distribution, organic carbon content, soil-water retention characteristics, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The distribution of soils along the hillslope was analyzed by aerial photography and soil survey techniques (profile and auger pedological descriptions) with the aim of distinguishing different soil units. Relationships were evaluated between these soil units and the hydraulic properties of the cores collected along the transect. A multivariate analysis was carried out to interpret the structure of soil hydraulic property spatial variability.

AB Tea is grown as a rainfed crop in the sloping lands of Sri Lanka. Fertility and productivity gradients exist in these lands. The objective of this study is to quantify the gradients at low (>600 m AMSL), mid (600-900 m AMSL) and high (>900 m AMSL) elevations and under good cover of tea and to examine the options available to manage them precisely for maximum tea production. Fertility gradients were measured in terms of soil organic C and bulk density. Productivity was measured by yield at crest, shoulder, mid-slope and foot slope positions. The results suggest that fertility and productivity were higher at crest and foot slope and low at mid-slope. Further a C balance sheet was prepared for topsoil by taking into account all the additions and losses. The additions are leaf fall from tea and shade trees, tea prunings, and compost. The losses are due to erosions and soil respiration. Organic C requirement was estimated using a linear regression relating forest organic carbon and elevations. Using the above relation, one could work out the exact amount of organic matter to be added to soil for precision management.

AB Sustainability of forest and rangeland ecosystems is intricately linked with healthy and productive soils. Soils vary widely in their quality. Their health is a condition of the soil relative to their inherent quality and ability to perform vital soil and ecosystem functions. Soils in Pacific Northwest forest and rangeland ecosystems are particularly heterogeneous. For example, selected soils from six Ecoregions, have organic carbon contents that range from about 40,000 to more than 800,000 kg/ha. Total nitrogen content ranges from less than 2,000 to more than 50,000 kg/ha.
   There is a close relationship between soil quality and health and ecosystem quality and health. Ecosystem stresses can be increased by management activities that compact soils and alter soil moisture and nutrient status and processes. Forest health in Inland Western forests is intricately linked with carbon and nutrient cycling. A high percentage of soil organisms make their home in the soil and play a critical role in the functions of ecosystems. Alteration of soil physical and nutrient conditions can alter the incidence of soil borne diseases which, in turn, affect the health of ecosystems.
   Specific quantitative soil standards, or thresholds, are needed to determine detrimental conditions. The National Forests have established a variety of measures of detrimental conditions. A variety of physical measures, such as bulk density changes, displacement and erosion, and detrimental burn conditions are emphasized.
   Soils vary widely in their resiliency, or ability to rebound from impacts. A model of soil resiliency adopted from Szabolcs (1994), includes physical, chemical and biological buffering and pedological and anthropological soil fluxes. Several soils from six Pacific Northwest Ecoregions are rated for their resiliency. Criteria for chemical, biological and physical buffering is included.

AB Continuous cropping or decreasing the frequency of summer fallow (F) in cereal based dryland rotations may have benefits other than greater water utilization and erosion control. We hypothesized that rotations with no fallow or minimum fallow frequency can produce more biomass and cover than the traditional winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer fallow systems (W-F), and ultimately, greater amounts of soil organic matter (SOM). To this end, we evaluated changes in various poets of SOM at the 0 to 5- and 0 to 15-cm depths on a Weld loam (ene, smectitic, mesic aridic Paleustolls) that were caused by (i) decreasing fallow or increasing cropping intensities, (ii) specific rotations of the same length but with different crop sequencing, and (iii) accumulated residue and roots from reduced- or no-tillage from 1993 to 1997, Total soil organic carbon (SOC) and N for the 0- to 5-cm depth increased by approximate to 20% with continuous cropping rotations compared with W-F rotations. Particulate organic matter-carbon (POM-C) doubled, while POM-N, and soluble organic C (OC) increased by one third for the same comparison. At the 0- to 15-cm depth, SOC, POM-C, and POM-N did not differ among systems with fallow, nor among systems with cropping intensities greater than W-F. Thus, significant differences always existed between W-F and continuous cropping. Generally, fallow had a negative influence on SOC accumulation, and continuous cropping a positive influence on surface SOM. Changes in SOC did not correlate with yields in the five-year comparison of this ongoing study.

AB Soil temperature affects crop growth through its impact on nutrient and water availability, yet few studies have quantitatively analyzed the effects of erosion on soil temperature regime. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the impact of soil erosion on diurnal temperature fluctuations, and develop a simple model for predicting soil temperature regime from soil properties. Measurements of soil properties were made on four erosion classes established on Rhodic Ferrasol on the basis of the thickness of Ap horizon under natural field conditions. Fourier series analysis and boundary conditions obtained from observed temperature data were used to develop the model for predicting soil temperature. Results obtained indicate that soil erosion exposes subsoil, reduces soil organic carbon and moisture content. For dry soil condition, the heat capacity was 0.26 cal/cm(3)degrees C for severely eroded and 0.23 cal/cm(3)degrees C for slightly eroded class. The maximum soil temperature was about 1 degrees C lower at 5 cm depth and 0.5 degrees C at 30 cm depth for least compared with severely eroded phase. At held capacity, volumetric heat capacity was 0.53 cal/cm(3)degrees C for severely eroded and 0.57 cal/cm(3)degrees C for least eroded phase. Fourier series analysis can be used to predict soil temperature under different soil conditions by applying an appropriate boundary condition. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Salt marsh formation can be initiated by the colonization of bare tidal flats by pioneer halophytes such as Spartina anglica. In the present study, growth of S. anglica in the edge and centre zones of pioneer patches colonizing a tidal flat in a marine bay in the south-west Netherlands was investigated. Average biomass and shoot length was significantly lower in centre zones than in edge zones of the patches. Multiple linear regression showed that 84% of the variance in aboveground biomass in the centre zones could be explained by sediment phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. No such relationship existed in the edge zone. This suggests that biomass production in the centre zones of the patches is nutrient limited, but that factors other than sediment nitrogen and phosphorus content determine growth of Spartina in the edge zones.
   The sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the centre zones of the patches were significantly related with sediment carbon concentrations, indicating that the pool of particle-bound nutrients in the sediment to an important extent is associated with organic particles. Determination of stable carbon isotope signatures of the sedimentary organic matter showed that an increasing carbon content of the sediment in the centre zone of the patches land a rise in plant biomass) coincides with a higher contribution of non-Spartina derived carbon to the sedimentary organic matter pool. Sustained biomass production in the centre zones of the patches, thus, probably depends on deposition of allochthonous organic particles and the nutrient inputs inherent in this process. Due to the construction of large-scale hydro-engineering works, however, conditions for deposition of waterborne particles are currently unfavourable. The consequences of reduced carbon and nutrient inputs into the patches will be particularly in the (older) centre zones, where the nutrient pools in non-refractory organic matter have been drained in the years of previous growth. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the canopy-enhanced sedimentation for which Spartina is well-known, via positive feed-back effects on plant growth can be crucial for plant vitality, and, hence, for successful colonization of unvegetated areas.

AB While we know that fallow tillage method affects water conservation and soil erosion control, effects on soil and fertilizer N dynamics are less well known. In this paper, we summarize results from our investigations of N transformation and cycling for two experiments established in 1969 and 1970 near Sidney, NE. In this research, the effects of three fallow tillage methods (moldboard plow, sub-till, and no-till) on changes in soil properties, N dynamics, and subsequent crop growth were studied. One experiment was on land, that had been broken from sod before 1920, seeded to crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.] in 1957, and cultivated again since 1967 with the above three fallow tillage methods. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was grown in a wheat-fallow sequence with and without 45 kg fertilizer N ha(-1). The second experiment was on land that was in native mixed prairie sod until 1969, and included a comparison of the three above tillage methods in a wheat-fallow system with plots remaining in native sod, During the first 13 years of study, total soil N loss from the surface 30 cm of soil (compared to the native sod) was only about 3% for the no-till system, compared to 8 and 19% for the sub-till and plow systems, respectively. For both experiments, considerable mineralization and nitrification of organic N occurred during the fallow period, with greatest rates for plowed fallow. No-till immobilized more labeled and total N in soil organic matter and in visible and partially decomposed crop residues on and near the soil surface. However, by harvest of the second crop grown after N-labeled fertilizer N was applied, Little if any of the labeled N was found in visible and partially decomposed crop residues or as soil inorganic N, suggesting that most of the fertilizer N applied was immobilized in soil organic N or was lost. Deep sampling (to 15 m) of the Native Sod plots showed that several hundred kg of NO3-N ha(-1) had leached beneath the crop root zone, presumably during wet years after fallow. For plowed plots, the quantity of NO3-N beneath the root zone approximated the loss in total soil N from the root zone, suggesting there was a little net loss of soil N by denitrification or ammonia volatilization. For no-till, quantities of NO3-N beneath the root zone exceeded the loss of total soil N during cultivation, suggesting significant N-fixation occurred by unknown mechanisms. These results show that fallow tillage system does affect soil and fertilizer N cycling and transformations and the availability of N to crops. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In an oxisol-spodosol system developed on the terrestrial surface of the lower Tapajos Valley, the determination of total mercury (Hg), organic carbon (C), iron and aluminum oxy-hydroxide (Fe-cdb and Al-cdb) concentrations in the surface soil horizons are used to characterise the geochemical processes controlling the accumulation of Hg in soils under natural vegetation cover and in deforested and cultivated sites. Oxisols from the plateau have homogeneous and relatively high background Hg contents and burdens constituting an important natural reservoir of Hg for the region (90-210 ng/g dry wt. and 19-33 mg/m(2) for the first 20 cm). The Fe-cdb and Al-cdb contents associated with the fine fraction (< 63 mu m) of the soil suggest that oxy-hydroxides and, particularly Al-substituted Fe oxy-hydroxides, control the Hg concentrations observed in all of the soils of the study region. Consequently, the geochemistry of these minerals along the slopes governs the accumulation or the release of the Hg according to the natural evolution of the soil cover and/or following the degradation of soils by erosion after deforestation and cultivation. These observations have important implications for the interpretation of Hg contamination patterns observed in Amazonian aquatic systems that could be linked to different drainage sources of Hg from the terrestrial surface. The sandification and podzolisation that is characteristic of the evolution of numerous pedological systems in the equatorial Amazon could be responsible for exportation of the naturally accumulated Hg, as for other metals, by acidic complexation and migration to the black waters of the Amazon. In the central Amazon region, as a result of the fragility of the soil cover, deforestation and cultivation, affecting principally the superficial soil, promote the selective erosion of fine particles enriched in oxides and Hg. The erosion of soil could be responsible for an important release of Hg, transported in particulate form by drainage waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation and soil properties were described across a well-dated sand-dune chronosequence bordering northern Lake Michigan to document patterns and rates of primary succession and forest ecosystem development, and to determine environmental constraints that potentially drive succession and regulate species diversity. The site experienced frequent and continuing formation of 72 shore-parallel dune ridges over the past 2375 yr. Across the chronosequence represented by the youngest 13 dune ridges aged 25-440 yr, there were clear patterns of species turnover and community convergence as well as successional changes in species diversity, aboveground biomass, aboveground litter production, net ecosystem production, nutrient pools, and nutrient cycling. Dune-building species were replaced by evergreen shrubs and bunchgrass within 100 yr, which in turn, were replaced by mixed pine forest within 345 yr. Plant-species richness increased to a peak in developing forest at 285 yr but thereafter decreased as early-successional species disappeared from the communities. Rates of species addition peaked between 95 and 145 yr as forest species invaded, whereas rates of species loss peaked between 345 and 440 yr as early-successional species were lost from the developing forest.
   Development of the forest ecosystem required similar to 300 yr (i.e., 145-440 years). Total ecosystem carbon increased in a logistic manner to 128 Mg C/ha, with net ecosystem production peaking at 30 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) in developing forest. Aboveground biomass and O horizon mass increased to similar to 137 Mg/ha and similar to 79 Mg/ha, respectively, whereas aboveground litter production increased to 3.5 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) at 440 yr, but thereafter varied between 175 and 350 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1). Total carbon and total nitrogen in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil and O horizon accumulated to similar to 42 Mg/ha and similar to 1.36 Mg/ha, respectively. Estimated average rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation over 440 yr of ecosystem aggradation were 23.2 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for carbon and 0.38 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for nitrogen. Because nitrogen-fixing plants are rare on the upland dune ridges, ecosystem aggradation depends largely on atmospheric nitrogen inputs. Following colonization by conifers, soil acidification resulted in rapid leaching losses of calcium and magnesium, whereas phosphorus and potassium were cycled more tightly.
   The dune chronosequence represents a complex gradient of changing environmental constraints that differentially reduce the survival, growth, and reproduction of plant species. Young dune ridges near the lake shore are characterized by strong winds, sand burial and erosion, high insolation, high rates of evaporation, and low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus. These conditions ameliorate with increasing dune age as wind velocities and sand movement diminish with distance from the lake, as accumulating organic matter improves the moisture-holding capacity and nitrogen availability of the soil, and as mineral weathering mobilizes soil phosphorus. However, in developing forest, light and cationic nutrients may become limiting, and decreased light availability, cool soil temperatures, and accumulation of a thick forest floor may limit recruitment from seed for many species. These numerous potential environmental constraints suggest a considerable complexity in this ostensibly simple ecosystem.

TI Aggregation of soil cropped to dryland wheat and grain sorghum

AB Successful and sustainable semiarid dryland cropping depends on effective soil water storage and erosion control, which are influenced by surface soil aggregate size and stability. We hypothesized longterm tillage and cropping system treatments affect water-stable aggregate size distribution, aggregate water stability, and dry soil aggregation. A study on a Torrertic Paleustoll from 1982 to 1994 at Bushland, TX, involved tillage methods (no-tillage, NT; stubble mulch tillage, SRIT) and cropping systems for dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production. In 1994, mean percentages of >4-mm water-stable aggregates at 0 to 2 cm were 3.5 with NT and 1.0 with SMT in wheat, sorghum, fallow, rotation phase, or crop comparison plots. Mean percentages of <0.25-mm aggregates were 49.0 with NT and 37.8 with SMT. More small aggregates with NT help explain why infiltration was 90% greater with SMT than with NT during fallow after sorghum and 26% greater with SMT during fallow after wheat in a similar study on the same soil when surface coverage by residues was limited (25% with SMT, 57% with NT for sorghum; 73% with SMT, 86% with NT for wheat). Aggregate sizes differed due to cropping system, rotation phase, and crop, but aggregate water stability and dry aggregation differences generally were nonsignificant. Both NT and SMT are deemed suitable for dryland crops under conditions as in this study because neither resulted in unfavorable soil conditions or major yield differences.

TI Tillage impacts on depth distribution of total and particulate organic

AB The benefits of no-tillage (NT) practices to soil organic matter (SOM) are inconsistent in fine-textured, poorly drained soils. Tillage imparts on SOM were investigated in central Illinois, assuming particulate organic matter (POM) would accumulate where SOM aggraded. Soils were collected in 1994 and 1995 from a trial established in 1985 at Ferry and Monmouth (somewhat poorly drained Aquic Argiudoll silt loams), and DeKalb (a poorly drained Typic Haplaquoll silty clay loam). In general, NT practices increased SOM-C and POM-C ;contents 25 and 70% compared with conventional till (CT) at the soil surface (0-5 cm). This was at the expense of C at depth (5-17.5 cm), which decreased by 4 and 18%, respectively. Tillage effects varied among sites. No-till increased SOM C and POM C more than 30 and 100%, respectively, in the top 5 cm of the two silt loams. In the silty clay loam, NT reduced SOM C 14% in the 5- to 17.5-cm depth and POM C more than 20% in the 5- to 30-cm depth. Bulk density was greater under NT than CT at the DeKalb (0-17.5 cm) and Monmouth sites (0-5 cm). No-till only increased C and N sequestration, assessed on an equivalent mass basis, at Monmouth. Accumulation of POM in the surface depth of the NT silt loams may have improved soil quality in those erosion-prone soils. Reduced POM contents in the NT silty clay loam may reflect SORI degradation. The high clay and organic matter content and low bulk density of the DeKalb soil may have contributed to the atypical effect of NT practices on SOM at that site.

AB The spatial and vertical distributions of Cs-137 in surface soils were surveyed and analyzed then correlated with the contents of organic carbon in the hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. et Zucc.) plantation forest and secondary forest dominated by red pine (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc.) in Japan. The spatial variation of Cs-137 activity was observed in the surface soil around the red pine. The average activity of 16 samples around the tree is 42.4 Bq/kg and the standard deviation is 25.9 Bq/kg. This finding indicates the importance in the selection of a sampling site and the number of samples from the surface soils especially around a tree. For the vertical distribution of Cs-137 activity, it was found that the concentration in the surface soil is highest, 149 Bq/kg in the hinoki stand and 101 Bq/kg in the red pine stand, and decreases with depth. The relationship between Cs-137 activity and carbon content in the forest soil was investigated in two undisturbed forest stands. The relations were more precisely expressed using an exponential equation than by a linear equation. From the same forest, similar regression equations were obtained. This indicates that the distribution of Cs-137 could be characterized by the organic carbon content in an undisturbed forest. It is also suggested that the coefficient values in the regression equation help to define the movement of Cs-137 accompanying the decomposition of organic matter.

AB Increasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils in Canada is examined as a possible strategy in slowing or stopping the current increase in atmospheric CO, concentrations. Estimates are provided on the amount of carbon that could be sequestered in soils in various regions in Canada by reducing summerfallow area, increased use of forage crops, improved erosion control, shifts from conventional to minimal and no-till, and more intensive use of fertilizers. The reduction of summerfallow by more intensive agriculture would increase the continuous cropland base by 8.1% in western Canada and 6.8% in all of Canada. Although increased organic carbon (OC) sequestration could be achieved in all agricultural regions, the greatest potential gains are in areas of Chernozemic soils. The best management options include reduction of summerfallow, conversion of fallow areas to hay or continuous cereals, fertilization to ensure nutrient balance, and adoption of soil conservation measures. The adoption of these options could sequester about 50-75% of the total agricultural emissions of CO2 in Canada for the next 30 years. However, increased sequestration of atmospheric carbon in the soil is possible for only a limited time. Increased efforts must be made to reduce emissions if long-term mitigation is to be achieved.

AB The severity of accelerated erosion is affected by slope gradient, slope shape, slope length, and tillage practices. Fly ash, the product of high temperature coal combustion, has been used previously as a sedimentation marker, hut it has never been used on the upland as an indicator of soil loss from erosion. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of soil removal from a hillslope as a result of accelerated erosion and its subsequent deposition on a lower landscape position using the presence, depth distribution, and concentration of fly ash, organic carbon, and magnetic susceptibility to identify the remaining original soil as well as a sediment marker. The study was carried out by comparing the amount of fly ash contained in the soil profile at different landscape positions of a cultivated site with that in an uncultivated woodland site. Fly ash deposition began in 1855 with traffic on the Illinois Central railroad between Chicago and Cairo, Illinois. In 1889 and 1928, additional rail Lines were located closer to both sites. Organic C, magnetic-mineral content, and magnetic susceptibility decreased regularly with depth at both sites. Magnetic susceptibility was generally higher on the uncultivated site compared with the cultivated site for all landscape positions except the lower footslope. Compared with the uncultivated site, there was 50% less fly ash on interfluve and shoulder landscape segments of the cultivated site, 35% less on the backslope, and 67% less on the depositional lower footslope position. When the entire transect site is considered, the cultivated site had 47% less fly ash in the upper 22.5-cm soil profr2e compared with the uncultivated site. These results indicated that 10.6 cm, or 47%, of the upper soil layer has been eroded from the hillslope since 1855 (142 years) as a result of accelerated erosion induced by cultivation. For the backslope, the presence of 65%, or 15 cm, of the original surface soil layers and 67% of the fly ash at the cultivated site places the soil in the moderately eroded phase of the Grantsburg soil.

AB This study examines the effect of soil water content on aggregate stability and determines the relationships between the variation in soil stability and soil physical properties (texture, organic carbon, bulk density, pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity) in a microcatchment located in a semi-arid area of southeast Spain. The aggregate stability of soils was determined at three soil water contents (close to saturation, field capacity and air-dry) using a laboratory rainfall simulator technique. The aggregate stability for wetter conditions was higher than for the air-dry conditions for 85% of the samples tested. Furthermore, considerable difference in air-dry aggregate stability values was observed for predominant erosional and depositional zones within the microcatchment. This variability in air-dry aggregates stability was closely related to hydraulic properties and organic carbon content of the soil. Test on aggregate stability of air-dried soils are particularly appropriate for soils from semi-arid environments, and provide a more sensitive indicator of differences in the soil stability within the microcatchment than wetter samples.

AB The study aimed at quantifying the effects of erosion on the productivity of a Nigerian soil involved the use of a half hectare farmland with history of various degrees of erosion severity. The farmland was divided into 3 different classes; class I (uneroded), class II (slightly eroded) and class III (moderately eroded) based on the degree of erosion severity and were then planted with maize. The mean topsoil's (0-15 cm) colour hue reduced from 7.5YR on class I to 5YR on class III soils (representing colour change from dark brown to dark reddish brown) on Munsell's colour chart. The soil properties and the maize yield on the farmland exhibited strong spatial variability, the trend of which appears to have been influenced by the topography of the area. The mean yield on the class II plots and the class III plots were 80% and 65% respectively of that in class I plots. Because of the strong functional dependencies identified among many of the variables, multivariate statistical procedure was used to identify the variables that influence maize yield. Seven components were selected based on factor analysis. These components when regressed against maize yield, were found to explain 95% of the variability in maize yield. The yield of maize on this soil was found to be determined by soil properties such as; bulk density, organic carbon, topsoil thickness, texture, pH and gravel content in the topsoil, and by base saturation, organic carbon and exchangeable acidity in the subsoil.

AB Loss on ignition (LOI) techniques have been refined to measure dust samples down to 0.0012 g. Using this method Australian rural dusts are shown to have a high organic matter content (mean 31% suspended dusts and 34% for deposited dusts). This contrasts with the low organic matter levels in soils (commonly < 1%), from which the organic matter largely derives by wind erosion and possibly local mechanical disturbance. Pollen is probably the next most important source of dust organic matter. Background suspended dusts range from 2 to 90% organic matter, depending upon: the winnowing by winds, monitoring site location, and temporal variations in local vegetation and other conditions. Dusts collected during entrainment events (dust storms) are lower in organic matter (8-67%), exhibit less variability than background dusts and decrease with total dust concentration, because of the reduced winnowing capacity of strong dust storm winds and the very low soil organic matter levels in dust storm source areas. When mixed with background dusts, entrainment event dusts dilute organic matter levels, contributing to the large temporal variability of organic matter levels in dusts. Deposited dusts show similar spatial and temporal trends to suspended dusts (3-91 %). These results have significance in several contexts, including: soil erosion, dust deposition in terrestrial and marine ecosystems and environmental health. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Physical and chemical soil properties were measured along a mountainous climatological gradient in the province of Alicante (Spain). The objective was to evaluate how the climate affects certain soil properties at different temporal and spatial scales. These properties include infiltration, runoff and sediment concentrations resulting from rainfall simulation experiments performed in winter and in summer. Chemical soil properties like carbonate content, organic matter content and CEC were analysed in reference soil profiles along the gradient. Physical soil properties like soil moisture content, macroaggregation and waterstable microaggregation were measured at monthly intervals during a year. The comparison of the results was done at different spatial (site, slope and patch) and temporal (monthly and seasonal) scales by means of some statistical tests. It can be concluded that there are some soil properties positively related to the gradient, like organic matter, clay content and CEC which increase with the annual rainfall. However, runoff coefficients and erosion are higher when the climatic annual rainfall. However, runoff coefficients and erosion are higher when the climatic conditions become more arid. Aggregation and infiltration capacity are higher on north-facing slopes and in vegetated patches than in south-facing slopes and in bare patches. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Enrichment ratios (ER) are widely used to predict loss of sorbed nutrients or pesticides with runoff sediment, while ER is frequently neglected in studies which quantify past erosion from global fallout Cs-137 losses. The ER of Cs-137 (ER-Cs-137) in the soil loss and the subsequent depletion of Cs-137 at the soil surface were determined for eight small watersheds (1.6-16.8 ha) with different soils and land use. Due to preferential loss of the clay fraction, the upper 5 mm of the soil surface was significantly depleted of Cs-137 after a heavy storm. A total of 31 watershed-events were investigated with soil losses ranging between 1.2 and 480 kg.ha(-1) and sediment concentrations between 1.98-and 54.1 g L-1. The correspondent ER-Cs-137(mean: 1.72, range: 0.40-4.95) was positively correlated to the ER of clay, organic carbon, total nitrogen and calcium-acetate-lactate-extractable phosphorus (P-CAL). A close correlation between ER-Cs-137 and ER-P(CAL)was also found for sediment samples of detention ponds,where most of the ER values were less than 1.0 due to depletion. Therefore, ER-P-CAL seems to be a suitable estimate of ER-(CS)-C-137 for both, erosion and deposition processes. Our findings strongly support the need for considering ER-Cs-137, when Cs-137 data are used to assess rates and pattern of soil redistribution. Otherwise, soil loss will be overestimated in a range of about factor 2 in many cases.

AB Soils in semi-arid regions are highly susceptible to soil organic matter (SOM) loss when cultivated because of erratic yield, removal of crop residue for feed or fuel, uncontrolled soil erosion, and frequent fallowing to increase water storage. It is important to quantify the effect of each factor to be able to identify agoecosystems that are sustainable and recognize the management practices that best sequester C in soil. We identified changes in SOM in long-term experiments, some dating from the early 1900s, by evaluating tillage and crop rotation effects at several locations in semi-arid regions of the US Pacific Northwest. The major factors influencing changes in organic C and N were the frequency of summer-fallow and the amount of C input by crop residue. Soil erosion was low in long-term studies, but even limited soil loss can have a substantial impact on C and N levels if allowed over many years. Yearly crop production is recommended because any cropping system that included summer-fallow lost SOM over time without large applications of manure. We conclude that most of the SOM loss was due to high biological oxidation and absence of C input during the fallow year rather than resulting from erosion. Decreasing tillage intensity reduced SOM loss, but the effect was not as dramatic as eliminating summer-fallow. Crop management practices such as N fertilization increased residue production and improved C and N levels in soil. SOM can be maintained or increased in most semi-arid soils if they are cropped every year, crop residues are returned to soil, and erosion is kept to a minimum. SOM loss may be more intense in the Pacific Northwest because fallowing keeps the soil moist during the summer months when it would normally be dry. Our experiments identify two primary deficiencies of long-term studies to measure C sequestering capability: (1) soil C loss can be partitioned between erosion and biological oxidation only by estimation, and (2) C changes occurring below 30 cm in grassland soils cannot be quantified in many instances because samples were not collected.

AB Because of concerns about the eventual impact of atmospheric CO2 accumulations, there is growing interest in reducing net CO2 emissions from soil and increasing C storage in soil. This review presents a framework to assess soil erosion and deposition processes on the distribution and loss of C in soils. The physical processes of erosion and deposition affect soil C distribution in two main ways and should be considered when evaluating the impact of agriculture on C storage. First, these processes redistribute considerable amounts of soil C, within a toposequence or a field, or to a distant site. Accurate estimates of soil redistribution in the landscape or field are needed to quantify the relative magnitude of soil lost by erosion and accumulated by deposition. Secondly, erosion and deposition drastically alter the biological process of C mineralization in soil landscapes, Whereas erosion and deposition only redistribute soil and organic C, mineralization results in a net loss of C from the soil system to the atmosphere. Little is known about the magnitude of organic C losses by mineralization and those due to erosion, but the limited data available suggest that mineralization predominates in the first years after the initial cultivation of the soil, and that erosion becomes a major factor in later years. Soils in depositional sites usuary contain a larger proportion of the total organic C in labile fractions of soil C because this material can be easily transported. if the accumulation of soil in depositional areas is extensive, the net result of the burial (and subsequent reduction in decomposition) of this active soil organic matter would be increased C storage. Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. At regional or global levels its greatest impact on C storage may be in affecting soil productivity. Erosion usually results in decreased primary productivity, which in turn adversely affects C storage in soil because of the reduced quantity of organic C returned to the soil as plant residues. Thus the use of management practices that prevent or reduce soil erosion may be the best strategy to maintain, or possibly increase, the worlds soil C storage, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B,V, All rights reserved.

AB The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was initiated to reduce water and wind erosion on marginal, highly erodible croplands by removing them from production and planting permanent, soil-conserving vegetation such as grass. We conducted a field study at two sites in Wyoming, USA, in order to quantify changes in soil C and N of marginal croplands seeded to grass, and of native rangeland plowed and cropped to wheat-fallow, Field plots were established on a sandy loam site and a clay loam site on wheat-fallow cropland that had been in production for 60+ years and on adjacent native rangeland. In 1993, 6 years after the study was initiated, the surface soil was sampled in 2.5 cm depth increments, while the subsurface soil was composited as one depth increment. All soil samples were analyzed for total organic C and N, and potential net mineralized C and N. After 60+ years of cultivation, surface soils at both study sites were 18-26% lower (by mass) in total organic C and N than in the A horizons of adjacent native range. Six years after plowing and converting native rangeland to cropland (three wheat-fallow cycles), both total and potential net mineralized C and N in the surface soil had decreased and NO3-N at all depths had increased to levels found after 60+ years of cultivation. We estimate that mixing of the surface and subsurface soil with tillage accounted for 40-60% of the decrease in surface soil C and N in long-term cultivated fields; in the short-term cultivated fields, mixing with tillage may have accounted for 60-75% of the decrease in C, and 30-60% of the decrease in N. These results emphasize the need to evaluate C and N in the entire soil solum, rather than in just the surface soil, if actual losses of C and N due to cultivation are to be distinguished from vertical redistribution. Five years after reestablishing grass on the sandy loam soil, both total and potential net mineralized C and N in the surface soil had increased to levels equal to or greater than those observed in the A horizon of the native range. On the clay loam soil, however, significant increases in total organic C were observed only in the surface 2.5 cm of N-fertilized grass plots, while total organic N had not significantly increased from levels observed in the long-term cultivated fields.

AB Poor aggregate stability and high erodibility of soils found in Mediterranean climates are often due to low organic matter content. The low organic matter content is sometimes compensated for by iron oxides that stabilize soil structure. Low water stability of aggregates often determines the propensity for soils to form surface crusts and seals (wet crusts). Seals reduce soil infiltration rate and may increase erosion by increasing runoff. We conducted rainfall simulation experiments on 30 cm x 30 cm plots inclined at 9% slope in which we measured soil splash and wash erosion, runoff and splash volume for seventeen California soils. The soils ranged in clay content from 8 to 36%, ESP from < 1 to 56%, and organic carbon from 0.4 to 7.0%. Infiltration rate was used as a measure of seal formation. Soils that had 3.1 to 7.0% organic carbon and 2.4 to 10.7% CBD extractable iron plus aluminum did not form seals, infiltration rate remained high throughout the rainfall run, and neither runoff nor erosion occurred, Soils with < 20% clay, < 3% organic carbon, and < 2.0% CBD extractable Fe + Al readily formed seals that reduced infiltration rate and total volume of water infiltrated and increased the volume of runoff water and mass of soil eroded. Initial soil water content was also important in determining crusting and subsequently the volume of runoff and amount of erosion. These data show that the formation of soil seals increases runoff and erosion through the early stages of seal development and that organic matter and iron oxides are critically important factors in determining soil surface stability and erodibility.

AB Within the framework of the IDAF (IGAC DEBITS AFRICA) network, we present in this paper data on precipitation and aerosol chemistry in the semiarid savanna of the Sahelian region of Niger. An automatic wet-only precipitation collector was operated at the Banizoumbou station during the entire 1996 rainy season (June to September 1996). Inorganic (Na(+), NH(4)(+), K(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+) Cl(-), NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-)) and organic contents of the precipitation (HCOOH, CH(3)COOH, C(2)H(5)COOH) were determined by Ion Chromatography (IC) in 29 rainfall events. Once per week, bulk particle samples were collected on the same site, and soluble water material was determined by IC. We examined the influence of atmospheric gas and particle sources on the precipitation and aerosol chemical contents. We established the influence of marine, terrigenous, and biogenic sources in the Sahelian region. The terrigenous signature is dominant and related to Sahelian soil erosion, with a high calcium content in precipitation (31.2 mu eq L(-1)) and in aerosols (1.8 mu g m(-3)). Two other signatures of atmospheric sources are highlighted by the relatively high nitrogenous (ammonium and nitrate) and organic contents (formate, acetate) in the precipitation. Ammonium (12.9 mu eq L(-1)) and nitrate (12.3 mu eq L(-1)) contents confirm respectively the biogenic source of ammonia released by domestic animal excreta in Niger and the natural emissions from semiarid savannas soils, perturbed by wild or domestic animal grazing. In spite of a high potential acidity given by nitrate, formate and acetate; a weak acidity (H(+) (2.1 mu eq L(-1)) is calculated from the mean pH of 5.67 measured. A statistical analysis of the aerosol chemical composition clearly indicates that nitrates are strongly correlated at the 1% level with terrigenous ions, i.e., Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) (0.95 < r < 1). We observed a similar relationship between all the terrigenous ions and nitrate in the precipitation. In the Sahelian region, alkaline soil dust representative of the terrigenous contribution interact, with gaseous nitrogenous and carbonaceous compounds, leading to the neutralization of acid gases and subsequent weak acidity in precipitation. Finally, taking into account the main chemical characteristics of Banizoumbou precipitations and aerosols, which demonstrate the importance of heterogeneous and multiphase chemical processes, we propose a conceptual model of the atmospheric chemistry in the Sahelian region.

AB Despite a relatively high organic matter content, the heavy soils of the St-Lawrence lowlands of eastern Canada are susceptible to structural degradation in the form of compaction, surface crusting and sheet erosion. The resistance of these soil to degradation is largely controlled by the presence of stable macroaggregates. Several agronomic studies involving various combinations of management options such as organic additions, crop rotations and reduced tillage have allowed to intensively monitor the changes in aggregation of these soils through time. The proportion of water-stable macroaggregates (>1 mm) showed large temporal variation. Short-range variations (days or weeks) were attributable to climatic conditions and tillage operations as revealed by significant correlations between soil water content and aggregation within a growing season. Longer-term trends (>2 years) were a function mostly of carbon (C) management i.e. placement or location of the residues in the soil profile, and the amount and quality of the residues. The effect of C management was reflected by correlations between aggregation, C inputs, soil C content and organic matter (OM) fractions. Based on a study of the OM associated with the primary particles it is proposed that the clay and silt particles of these soils are relatively saturated in OM which leads to highly stable microaggregation. Any additional OM accumulation in the surface soil provided by reduced- or no-till conditions, perennial forage crops or manure additions would lead to increased macroaggregation and be related to the accumulation of particulate OM. This hypothesis helps to explain the relatively high responsiveness of soil structure, and in particular stable macroaggregation, to changes in cropping systems in these soils.

AB Knowledge of seasonal variation in soil structural and related properties is important for the determination of critical periods during which soil is susceptible to accelerated erosion and other degradative processes. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the magnitude of seasonal variations in selected soil and deposited sediment properties in relation to soil erodibility for a Miamian silt-loam soil (Typic Hapludalf) in central Ohio. Erosion plots (USLE-type) were established on a 4.5% slope and maintained under bare, ploughed conditions from 1988 to 1991. Particle size distribution, bulk density (rho(b)), percentage water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon(SOC), and total soil nitrogen (TSN) of both soil and sediment samples were monitored between Autumn 1989 and Spring 1991. The soil and sediment particle size distributions followed no clear seasonal trends. Soil rho(b) increased following tillage (1.20 Mg m(-3)) and was highest (1.45 Mg m(-3)) during the autumn owing to soil slumping and consolidation upon drying. Low winter and spring values of rho(b) and %WSA (20-50% lower than in autumn) were attributed to excessive wetness and freeze-thaw effects. Both SOC and soil TSN contents progressively declined (from 2.18 to 1.79% and 1.97 to 1.75 g kg(-1), respectively) after ploughing owing to maintenance of plots under bare, fallow conditions. Spring highs and autumn lows of sediment SOC (3.12 vs. 2.44%) and TSN (2.70 vs. 1.96 g kg(-1)) contents were a result of the combined effects of soil microbial activity and rainfall erosivity. Soil properties such as bulk density, SOC and WSA, which vary seasonally, can potentially serve as predictors of seasonal soil erodibility, which, in turn, could improve the predictive capacity of soil erosion prediction models.

AB This paper discusses the agricultural system in the Charazani region in the Bolivian Eastern Cordillera. The zone from 2800 m to 4300 m asl is intensively used by Indian people and a small Mestizo group. Their traditional agriculture reflects both Indian and Spanish (16th century) traditions. Such traditional systems have been subject to rather contrary myths: some call them primitive, others ecologically adapted. Studying key variables of soil fertility (concentrations and contents (pools) of organic carbon and utilizable water storage capacities) we will investigate the degree of ecological adaptation of the soil-use system in the Charazani region. These parameters, studied in 110 field sequences covering 0-30 cm soil depth, are discussed according to their absolute levels, differences between semi-natural and agriculturally used areas, and (only for organic carbon contents) actual changes during continuous management. The results show that land-use on the dry, wind-exposed and nor irrigated sites is often insufficiently ecologically adapted. Here, intensive crop farming and sheep pasture without protection against wind erosion result in low and even decreasing soil fertility. Good ecological adaptation according to the investigated parameters is to be found, by contrast, on the more humid and better wind-protected sites as well as on the irrigated areas.

AB This paper presents field and column experiments to determine the fate of radionuclides (U-238, Ra-226 and (210)pb) and Mn, when applied in uranium mine waste water sprayed on to highly weathered soils near the Ranger uranium mine at Jabiru, Northern Territory, Australia. The radionuclides were retained in the surface few centimetres of soil. U-238 and Pb-210 did not remain in exchangeable forms after reaction with the soil, and there is little likelihood of them moving with water. Ra-226 was also retained in the surface of the soils and did not move, but it contrasted with the other radionuclides in that > 14% of the total was in the exchangeable form which may be available for uptake by roots. The field experiment with Na-22 and Mn-54 tracers showed that Na was readily leached out of the soil by wet season rains and Mn-54 was slightly more mobile than the radionuclides. In the soil column experiment Mn-54 was transported rapidly and this was related to saturation of sorption sites by very high loading rates. For the surface (0-4 cm) horizon, which had more organic carbon than subsurface horizons, transport was promoted by reduction caused by saturation of the soil. Although more mobile than the radionuclides, Mn is unlikely to reach the groundwater if applied to the soils tested under field conditions. The radionuclides will remain at the surface of the soil, and although this is advantageous in preventing their accessions to groundwater, it has the disadvantage that the radionuclides are exposed to mobilisation with soil subject to wind and water erosion, to uptake by plants and to ingestion by foraging animals.

AB This paper examines the linkages between the carbon cycle and sedimentary processes on land. Available data suggest that sedimentation on land can bury vast quantities of organic carbon, roughly 10(15) g C yr(-1). To evaluate the relative roles of various classes of processes in the burial of carbon on land, terrestrial sedimentation was modeled as a series of 864 scenarios. Each scenario represents a unique choice of intensities for seven classes of processes and two different global wetland distributions. Comparison was made with presumed preagricultural conditions. The classes of processes were divided into two major component parts: elastic sedimentation of soil-derived carbon and organic sedimentation of autochthonous carbon. For elastic sedimentation, masses of sediment were considered for burial as reservoir sediment, lake sediment, and combined colluvium, alluvium and aeolian deposits. When the ensemble of models is examined, the human-induced burial of 0.6-1.5.10(15) g yr(-1) of carbon on land is entirely plausible. This sink reaches its maximum strength between 30 degrees and 50 degrees N. Paddy lands stand out as a type of land use that warrants future study, but the many faces of rice agriculture limit generalization In an extreme scenario, paddy lands alone could be made to buy about 1.10(15) g C yr(-1). Arguing that terrestrial sedimentation processes could be much of the sink for the so called "missing carbon" is reasonable. Such a hypothesis, however, requires major redesign of how the carbon cycle is modeled. Unlike ecosystem processes that are amenable to satellite monitoring and parallel modeling, many aspects of terrestrial sedimentation are hidden from space.

AB Every production practice, including conservation tillage, has positive or negative environmental consequences that may involve air, land, water and/or the health and ecological status of wildlife. The negative impacts associated with agricultural production and the use of conventional tillage systems in particular, include soil erosion, energy use, leaching and runoff of agricultural chemicals and carbon emissions. Several of these impacts are quantified. The conclusions suggest that the use of conservation tillage does result in less of an adverse impact on the environment from agricultural production than does conventional tillage by reducing surface water runoff, wind erosion and to some extent the enhancement of wildlife habitat. The benefits to be gained from carbon sequestration will depend on the soil remaining undisturbed and further expansion of conservation tillage on highly erodible land will unquestionably result in an increase in social benefits but the expected gains will be modest.

AB The export of carbon from land to sea by rivers represents a major link in the global carbon cycle, For all principal carbon forms, the main factors that control the present-day fluxes at the global scale have been determined in order to establish global budgets and to predict regional fluxes. Dissolved organic carbon fluxes are mainly related to drainage intensity, basin slope, and the amount of carbon stored in soils. Particulate organic carbon fluxes are calculated as a function of sediment yields and of drainage intensity. The consumption of atmospheric/soil CO2 by chemical rock weathering depends mainly on the rock type and on the drainage intensity. Our empirical models yield a total of 0.721 Gt of carbon (Gt C) that is exported from the continents to the oceans each year. From this figure, 0.096 Gt C come from carbonate mineral dissolution and the remaining 0.625 Gt C stem from the atmosphere (F-CO2). Of this atmospheric carbon, 33% is discharged as dissolved organic carbon, 30% as particulate organic carbon, and 37% as bicarbonate ions. Predicted inorganic carbon fluxes were further compared with observed fluxes for a set of 35 major world rivers, and possible additional climatic effects on the consumption of atmospheric CO2 by rock weathering were investigated in these river basins. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the river carbon fluxes and the role of continental erosion in the global carbon cycle during the last glacial maximum.

AB Tillage and soil management effects on soil physical and chemical qualities were monitored for eight years from 1979 through 1987 in a long-term experiment involving 17 consecutive crops of maize. Effects of no-till and plow-till methods of seedbed preparation were compared at two levels of residue management (residue removed versus residue returned) and two levels of fertilizer application (without fertilizer versus recommended fertilizer). Soil chemical quality was better for no-till compared with plow-till methods. Mean soil chemical properties of 0-5 cm depth for no-till and plow-till treatments respectively were 18.6 g kg(-1) versus 12.2 g kg(-1) for soil organic carbon content, 1.9 g kg(-1) versus 1.1 g kg(-1) for total soil nitrogen, 0.14 units yr(-1) versus 0.18 units yr(-1) rate of decline in soil pH, 63.1 mg kg(-1) versus 31.8 mg kg(-1) for Bray-P, and 6 0 cmol kg(-1) Versus 2.3 cmol kg(-1) for Ca+2. Soil chemical quality consistently declined, although the rate of decline differed among tillage and fertilizer treatments. There were also differences in soil physical quality. Soil bulk density increased with cultivation duration in both tillage methods, and use of furadan in no-till plots drastically increased soil bulk density. Infiltration rate and soil moisture retention at all suctions was consistently more for no-till than plow-till treatments. Decline in soil quality with cultivation was reflected in decrease in crop yields. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A deeper knowledge of the hydrological response of semi-arid Mediterranean watersheds would be useful in the prediction of runoff production for assessing flood risks and planning flood mitigation works. This study was conducted to identify the runoff generation mechanisms and their controlling factors at the hillslope scale in a Mediterranean semi-arid watershed. Four zero-order microcatchments were selected to measure rainfall and runoff for a three-year period. Two groups of soil were differentiated with respect to the hydrological response. The fine textured, poorly permeable soils of low organic carbon content had a greater runoff coefficient (9%) and lower runoff threshold (3.6 mm) than more permeable, coarser textured soils of medium organic carbon content (<3%, and 8 mm, respectively). The influence of rainfall characteristics on the hydrological response was different. Rain intensity was the major rainfall parameter controlling the runoff response in the microcatchments on fine textured, low infiltrability soils with a poor plant cover, while total rainfall was more closely correlated with runoff in coarser textured, highly permeable soils with a denser plant cover. It can be concluded that there are two runoff generation mechanisms: (i) an infiltration-excess overland flow in the more degraded areas with low organic carbon content (<0.5%) and low infiltrability (> 5 mm h(-1)); and (ii) a saturation-excess overland flow in the less degraded areas with a high organic carbon content (>2%), high infiltrability (>8 mm h(-1)) and covered by a dense plant cover (>50%).

AB When the aggregate stability of soils is evaluated under water-saturated conditions by conventional methods of wet-sieving at fixed times (5 to 20 min), the dynamic features of aggregate breakdown ape often lost on. ignored. An exponential equation, y(t) = a[1 - exp(-t/c)] + b, is proposed to describe the dynamic features of aggregate breakdown as a function of wet-sieving time. Parameter a is the maximum estimated abrasion Boss of aggregates, b is the incipient failure of the aggregates when saturated in water, and c is a parameter that links the rate of aggregate breakdown to wet-sieving time. The equation was validated with experimental data using toes samples of a wide range of Italian topsoils developed on Tertiary deposits, With R-2 values close to unity for fitting data from all 100 soil samples, the equation described successfully the dynamics of aggregate breakdown, anti, the parameters accounted for variations among the scans based on soil type, parent material, and land use. We also scale the exponential equations for the 100 sails with scaling factors to define a scale mean curve for the aggregate breakdown of all soils, The scale factors were obtained by minimizing an objective function containing measured values of aggregate lass and the scale mean curve. The magnitude of the scaling factor gives a quantitative estimate of aggregate stability (the larger its value, the greater the aggregate stability) for each soil, whereas the particular values of parameters a, b, and c describe the kinetics of aggregate breakdown for each soil. A multivariate analysis showed that the value of the scale factors Legends significantly on the amounts of amorphous iron oxides and organic carbon in the topsoil as well as on the topographical elevation of the soil surface.

AB The Rolling Pampa is the mast important cropping region of Argentina, and its soils are subjected to degradation. No-tillage has been proposed to replace tie use of the moldboard plow to reduce soil C losses. The effects of no-tillage and plow tillage with and without N fertilization (0 or 90 kg N ha(-1)) on C inputs and outputs of a Typic Argiudoll and on organic C level and density fractions were studied in a field experiment at the end of 15 gr under a corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Microbial biomass and the Fate of organic C mineralization during laboratory incubations were also determined. Nitrogen fertilization lad no significant influence on C emission in the field, soil organic matter level or microbial biomass and activity. The annual C budget was negative under both tillage systems, but no-tillage lost about 0.7 to 1.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) more C than did plow tillage. Carbon in the medium-density fraction (density = 1.6-2.0 g mL(-1)) of the 0- to 20-cm soil layer was 30% higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) under no-tillage. Light (density < 1.6 g mL(-1)) and heavy (density > 2.0 g mL(-1)) organic fractions, total C, and microbial biomass and activity in the 0- to 20-cm laver were not different in no-filled and plowed soils, despite different patterns of distribution with depth. The rates of organic C mineralization during laboratory incubations were the same for both tillage systems. We propose that, after an accumulation phase, soil under no-tillage loses higher amounts of CO2-C than under plowing. The use of no-tillage would not significantly affect soil organic matter pools of the region nl situations with low erosion losses.

   agricultural terraces in Mediterranean Spain
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
LA English

   agricultural terraces; Spain
AB Abandonment of degraded and marginal agricultural land is a widespread phenomenon in Spain and other Mediterranean countries. To study soil development and site dynamics, a comparative investigation of field groups representing different ages of abandonment was realized in the Meastrazgo region of the Mediterranean province of Castellon. Analysis of soil samples for organic carbon and total nitrogen content and pH showed that a sufficient regeneration of organic matter is accomplished after 20 years of fallow.
   Contrary to this there is no build-up of 'available' phosphorus after abandonment. A fixation of phosphorus in unavailable forms in the first fallow years seems evident, and there is no re-enrichment through solution or mineralization of organically bound P thereafter.
   The vegetation of the fallow fields develops after passing through a low-cover therophyte stage within 10-20 years to nanophanerophyte-dominated matorral (shrubs), in the best case within 40-50 years to a stone oak juniper association. Under intensive cattle grazing, grasslands rich in hemicryptophytes evolved.
   Rates of soil erosion estimated through application of the Universal Soil Loss Equation are of medium to low intensity and range between 2.2 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the first fallow years and 0.6 t ha(-1) year(-1) after establishment of vegetation cover. Under grassland erosion is negligible unless vegetative cover is destroyed through treading. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Late Dinantian palaeokarst of England and Wales: implications for
   exposure surface development

AB Palaeokarst is an important feature of late Dinantian exposure surfaces. Soil-filled depressions are widely developed. These are comparable to modern day solution dolines and were probably interspersed by areas of relatively bare limestone pavement. The palaeokarst primarily exhibits a smooth, mamillated to potholed surface form, consistent with its formation beneath a soil cover. Areas between the depressions have been extensively stylolitised and would likely have originally been characterized by small-scale fretted and sculpted karren forms typical of subaerial karstification. Palaeokarst pits making up the depressions are thought to have been initiated through stem-flow drainage from trees. Rain water, intercepted by the crown of the tree, was concentrated at specific sites on the emergent surface and dissolution beneath the trunk produced cylindrical pits that propagated vertically downwards. Trees responsible for concentrating drainage may also have enhanced the acidic nature of the rain water through leaching of organic acids from foliar and woody tissues. Downward propagation of the pits was limited to the uppermost 1-2 m and enlargement primarily occurred through lateral amalgamation of adjacent pits. Once initiated, continued development of the depressions would have been self perpetuating; the preferential accumulation of volcanic ash and organic matter enhancing water retention and encouraging further vegetation growth. In contrast, intervening areas would have been characterized by slow vertical denudation only. Karstification likely took of the order of a few hundred years in the case of potholed palaeokarstic surfaces formed solely by stem-flow drainage, to a few tens of thousands of years where the palaeokarst is more mature.

TI APSIM's water and nitrogen modules and simulation of the dynamics of

AB APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) is a software system which provides a flexible structure for the simulation of climatic and soil management effects on growth of crops in farming systems and changes in the soil resource. The focus of this paper is the predictive performance of APSIM for simulation of soil water and nitrate nitrogen in contrasting soils (vertisols and alfisols) and environments. The three APSIM modules that determine the dynamics of water, carbon, and nitrogen in the soil system (viz. SOILWAT, SOILN and RESIDUE v.1) are described in terms of the processes represented with particular emphasis on aspects of their coding that differ from their precursors in CERES and PERFECT. The most fundamental change is in SOILN, which now provides a formal balance of both carbon and nitrogen in the soil and includes a labile soil organic matter pool that decomposes more rapidly than the bulk of the soil organic matter. Model performance, in terms of prediction of soil water and nitrate, is evaluated during fallows, thereby avoiding complications arising from water use and nitrogen uptake by a crop. One data set is from a long-term experiment on a vertisol in southeast Queensland which studied two tillage treatments (conventional and zero tillage) in combination with fertiliser nitrogen inputs for the growth of wheat; soil water and nitrate were measured twice each year (pre-planting and post-harvest). The second comes from experiments at Katherine, Northern Territory, where legume leys growing on alfisols were chemically killed and ensuing changes in soil water and nitrate were measured during a single season. For both datasets, the predictive ability of the model was satisfactory for water and nitrate, in terms of both the total amounts in the whole profile and their distribution with depth. Since neither of these datasets included measurements of the runoff component of the water balance, this aspect of model performance was evaluated, and shown to be generally goad, using data from a third source where runoff had been measured from contour bay catchments.

AB Declining water quality on the south coast of Western Australia has been associated with increasing input of nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), from diffuse agricultural sources. A survey of surface (0-10 cm) soil properties (ammonium oxalate extractable iron, bicarbonate extractable P and K, pH, organic carbon and salinity) from 7950 sites mostly on agricultural land, along with information on fertiliser practices, land use, soil type, rainfall and time since agricultural development reveals patterns of nutrient status and fertiliser practice, and improved understanding of potential nutrient export hazards. Significant increases in soil bicarbonate extractable P and K have been brought about by continued traditional application of P based fertilisers. Soil organic carbon decreased after clearing, but then increased as soil fertility increased. There has been little change in soil pH or salinity. A significant interaction between time since agricultural development and ammonium oxalate extractable Fe indicated that the rate of change and absolute value of soil bicarbonate extractable P increased as time and ammonium oxalate extractable Fe increased. Soils with low ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (400 mg kg(-1)) reach a maximum soil bicarbonate P more quickly (< 30 yr) than soils with high ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (> 30 yr). Optimum land management should be based around the reducing P leaching through sandy soils with low ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (low P retention), and reducing runoff and erosion from soils with high ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (high P retention) and a long fertiliser history. More than half of the soils tested contained sufficient bicarbonate extractable P (high P status) to forego P applications for at least one year; however, 90% received P applications independently of the soil test information. Two thirds of the high P status soils were deficient in S, whilst 25% were deficient in K. Correcting these nutrient deficiencies would reduce the rate of increase in soil P and reduce the P loss export hazard. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Studies of the impact of traditional agroforestry practices on soil nutrient status in the Amazon Basin have largely been limited to upland sites, many of which are oligotrophic. However, rural population density in Amazonia is highest on the floodplains of the major rivers and shifting cultivation has been practiced on the floodplains for millennia. We established a slash-and-burn cultivation plot and an untreated forest plot in tidal floodplain successional forest in the Islands of Abaetetuba, Para, Brazil, and sampled soils (0-10 cm) during four phases of the agroforest cycle (n = 9 in each plot for each sampling period): (1) prior to clearing, (2) following burning, (3) harvest one (rice at four months), and (4) harvest two (sugar cane at 15 months). During the course of this pilot experiment, background temporal variability in SOC, total N and available mineral nutrient pools (P, K, Ca, Mg) exceeded treatment effects, suggesting that soil nutrient pools in this environment are well-buffered against the effects of shifting cultivation. These results contrast markedly with those reported for Amazonian upland sites where nutrient pulses and declines associated with the agroforest cycle have been demonstrated and may restrict the potential for low-input, continuous cultivation. Physical limitations imposed by flooding and fluvial erosion, rather than nutrient constraints, restrict the potential of agricultural intensification in the tidal floodplains.

AB We investigated the effects of 2 different grazing regimes on the surface soil properties of a dunefield land system in the semi-arid woodlands of eastern Australia. Sandy siliceous, thermic Xeric Haplargids (Siliceous Sands, Ucl . 23) occur on the sandy, 2-4-m-high longitudinal dunes. Fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Xeric Haplargids (Massive Red Earths, Uc2 . 13) occur in the swales between the dunes. We compared very high-intensity grazing (approx. 1 year) by feral goats with low-intensity grazing (approx. 4 years) by sheep. A rainfall simulator, applying water at the rate of 30 mm/h, measured the hydraulic properties of the surface soils formed under the 2 different grazing regimes. We examined undisturbed samples of the upper 5-cm layer of the soil surface using micromorphological techniques.
   In the swales, there were no differences in the effects of the 2 grazing regimes on soil properties. At low-intensity sheep grazing (0.2-0.3 sheep/ha), the soil surface on the dunes remained in an excellent condition. The surface had a good vegetative cover and consisted of either loosely packed sand grains, or areas where the sand grains were bonded together by clay and organic matter to form an organic crust. The total carbon content of the 0-2 cm depth of soil was 0.86%. Both soil surfaces have a high infiltration rate (i.e. >30 mm/h) and also appear to contain stable microaggregates of parna material distributed among the eolian sand grains. Very high-intensity goat grazing (up to 4.0 goats/ha) rapidly depleted the perennial grasses, killed most of the shrubs, and converted the soil surface on the dunes to one highly susceptible to erosion by wind. The low total carbon content (depth 0-2 cm) of 0.3% and absence of iron-stained clay coatings on the sands further support this view. The surface soil on the dunes in the very high-intensity goat-grazing plots consisted of either loosely packed sand grains or areas where poorly orientated clays coated the sand grains to form a strong, physical crust. We suggest that the physical crust may cause a change in the hydrology of the land system which may enhance the conditions for recruitment of unpalatable shrubs in the dune-swale interface. This increase in unpalatable shrubs and decrease in perennial grasses caused by the very high intensity goat grazing is therefore detrimental to the long-term productivity of these semi-arid lands.

AB Agriculture has been practiced in the USA for hundreds of years. The general trend has been to produce foodstuffs and send them to towns and villages where most of the population lives. As a largely agrarian society, concentration of wastes was not a big problem because much of the wastes produced were applied back to the land where it came. With the population shift from farms to large cities the waste streams became larger and more concentrated. Disposal of these wastes was generally in landfills. Today with the increased cost of landfilling, less landfill space and regulations restricting what can be filled, land application of many waste streams is becoming more economically desirable. Also given the fact that many of these waste streams contain beneficial organic materials and nutrients that came from the soil to begin with, it may be beneficial to amend the soil with them to improve soil organic carbon content, nutrient status and control erosion. The objective of this study was to develop a methodology to create a synthetic soil from waste materials. We studied two waste streams from a coal-fired power plant and a pharmaceutical operation in order to develop a co-blending technology. The method consisted of mixing the hot ashes with wet ORIS, Different combinations of mixtures were studied to determine the optimum ratio of wastes to provide a soil like material. By combining the organic rich industrial sludge (ORIS) with fly and bottom ash from a fluidized bed combustor we were able to reduce the adverse properties of both materials and create a soil like material with favorable properties. The ash provided a structural backbone for the ORIS and the ORIS served as a proton donor to reduce the alkalinity of the ashes. The impact of this research is that two waste materials with adverse properties can be combined such that they form a beneficial material with soil like properties that can be used as a synthetic soil for soil amending to improve organic matter content and potentially erosion control.

AB The environmental costs and benefits of producing bioenergy crops can be measured both in terms of the relative effects on soil, water and wildlife habitat quality of replacing alternate cropping systems with the designated bioenergy system, and in terms of the quality and amount of energy that is produced per unit of energy expended. While many forms of herbaceous and woody energy crops will likely contribute to future biofuels systems, The Department of Energy's Bioenegy Feedstock Development Program (BFDP), has chosen to focus its primary herbaceous crops research emphasis on a perennial grass species, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). The choice of switchgrass as a model bioenergy species was based on its high yields, high nutrient use efficiency and wide geographic distribution. Another important consideration was its positive environmental attributes. The latter include its positive effects on soil quality and stability, its cover value for wildlife, and relatively low inputs of energy, water and agrochemicals required per unit of energy produced. A comparison of the energy budgets for corn, which is the primary current source of bioethanol, and switchgrass reveals that the efficiency of energy production for a perennial grass system can exceed that for an energy intensive annual row crop by as much as 15 times. In addition potential reductions in CO2 emissions, tied to the energetic efficiency of producing transportation fuels and replacing non-renewable petrochemical fuels with ethanol derived from grasses are very promising. Calculated carbon sequestration rates may exceed those of annual crops by as much as 20-30 times, due in part to carbon storage in the soil. These differences have major implications for both the rate and efficiency with which fossil energy sources can be replaced with cleaner burning biofuels. Current research is emphasizing quantification of changes in soil nutrients and soil organic matter to provide improved understanding of the long term changes in soil quality associated with annual removal of high yields of herbaceous energy crops.

DT Article
AB The organic carbon database for the soils of Siberia has been developed. It includes data on humus content and bulk density determined in 5850 and 2300 soil pits, respectively. On the basis of these data we calculated the reserve of organic carbon in Siberian soils. It constitutes 199 x 10(9) t, or 13.1% of the total world pool. During the last century, the total loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils in Western Siberia amounted to 11.2 x 10(8) t, or 29% of the initial content. The losses induced by erosion and deflation reached 1.1 x 10(8) t, or 10% of the total loss. With the passage of time, the loss induced by mineralization decreases, whereas the soil erosion loss increases. Bog ecosystems of Western Siberia serve as sinks for carbon dioxide owing to the active accumulation of peat. Within the past century, the amount of carbon sequestered in peat deposits of Western Siberia has reached approximately 15 x 10(8) t, i.e., it is 1.5 times higher than the loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils within the same period.

TI Modelling the impact of erosion on soil productivity: A comparative
   evaluation of approaches on data from southern Brazil
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Erosion changes soil properties, removes nutrients and alters crop yields. A knowledge of these impacts on soil productivity is needed for economic analyses of erosion and conservation. Based on a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization experimental design to monitor these changes, results are reported from four research sites in southern Brazil on Ferralsols and Cambisols, enabling the construction of erosion-yield-time and nutrient loss relationships. Plot experiments ran for up to seven years of natural erosion, followed by one or two years of maize cropping. A remarkably consistent composite erosion-yield relationship in logarithmic form was found, showing a sharp yield decline with initial soil loss. Soil 'resilience' was identified through erosion-time relationships, 'sensitivity' through erosion-yield equations. As erosion progressed, losses of nutrients, especially of organic carbon and calcium, were significant. In situ changes in soil properties were far less marked. Together with measured yield reductions caused by cumulative erosion, these results enabled the modelling of changes in soil productivity over time with respect to both soil quality and impact on yields. A production 'half-life' of between one and 39 years according to soil type and level of erosion was also identified.

AB Mechanisms of organic carbon (OC) and P enrichment in sediment eroded from well-aggregated soils are not well understood. This study was conducted to examine why OC and extractable P (ext-P) were enriched in sediment with a well-aggregated Oxisol. Soil samples presented four field treatments: no fertilization (NF), short-term P fertilization (STP), long-term P fertilization (LTP), and organic waste fertilization (OW), Organic C in dry-sieved aggregates increased with decreasing aggregate size for all treatments, suggesting that OC is preferentially retained in small aggregates and, perhaps, protected from microbial attack, Extractable P concentration changed little with aggregate size for the NF treatment, but increased significantly with decreasing aggregate size for the STP and OW treatments and for liquid-P incubated NF soil, This difference,vas attributed to the blockage of interior sorption sites within large aggregates. Breakdown of dry STP and OW aggregates by simulated storms produced fine aggregates that were richer in OC and ext-P than the original larger ones. Most of the fine aggregates were created in the early phase of rainfall by sinking dry aggregates, and further breakdown by stripping water-stable aggregates was more difficult and slow, Sediment enrichment observed in eroded sediment was caused by selective transport of P and OC-rich fine aggregates induced by the effects of aggregation blockage and aggregate breakdown by slaking and stripping, For the LTP treatment, however, ext-P concentration was independent of aggregate size, indicating that a uniform P distribution in aggregates ran be reached given sufficiently long equilibration time.

ID CORN
AB Maintaining environmental quality implies sustainable agricultural production systems that preserve and protect soil resources. Cover crops play a dual role maintaining resource quality by providing ground cover to prevent wind and water erosion and carbon input to enhance soil quality. Carbon input from cover crops and crop stover play a vital role in agroecosystems for insuring long-term economic benefits with minimal impact on soil, water and air quality. The fresh carbon from cover crops is critical because of the role of the soil organic carbon cycle in controlling water, temperature, aeration, and soil structure. Both aboveground and root biomass are important to chemical and biological properties for the role in nutrient cycling. The benefits of available nitrogen from symbiotic fixation makes legume cover crops an environmental and economic preference. Use of selected cover crops and associated allelopathic effects can reduce chemicals required for weed control. While there are positive and negative aspects of cover crops from the economic viewpoint, when environmental costs are properly credited, cover crops surface as a major contribution to soil and environmental quality. The challenge is to assure cost-effective production using cover crops to maintain a healthy environment, a healthy economy, and a high quality of life.

AB A rapid increase in population is causing severe strain on natural resources and environment of East Africa. Per capita arable land area is declined in several densely populated regions of East Africa. Two major issues in soil and environmental degradation, i.e., greenhouse effect and water quality are described. Three principal soil degradation processes with reference to productivity are physical, chemical and biological degradation. Soil physical degradation can affect crop growth and yield by decreasing root depth and available water and nutrient reserves and soil erosion can lead to yield loss by affecting soil organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents and soil pH. Reduction in maize grain yield on moderately and severely eroded soils compared with uneroded soils in Tanzania was 14 to 39%. Chemical degradation is caused by the processes of nutrient depletion and/or loss of organic matter, acidification and toxic aluminum, salinization, and industrial and mining activities. In Tanzania, a modest cropping system of maize and bean removed about 58, 13, and 56 kg ha(-1) of N, P, and K, respectively. The average use of fertilizers in this cropping system was only 22.5 kg ha(-1) and thus resulting in "nutrient mining." Principal issues of agricultural sustainability are discussed.

AB Revegetation and restoration of degraded wildland ecosystems depends upon an adequate, long-term supply of nitrogen from a variety of nitrogen pools. Site disturbance often reduces or removes the soil organic matter, soil microbes and plant litter that are the sources of these nitrogen pools. This is especially true in the thin, nutrient poor, relatively young high elevation soils of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This paper describes an ongoing study intended to characterize several aspects of this nitrogen supply. These aspects include: (1) the amount of nitrogen in various pools that support plant growth for extended periods of time land delineates sustainable from non-sustainable), (2) the seasonal release rate or turnover of nitrogen required for a healthy, dynamic plant community, (3) the soil sampling depth required to adequately characterize the condition of a disturbed site and (4) the estimated nitrogen release rate of various fertilizers, organic soil amendments including composts and mulches that might be used to "bootstrap" disturbed soil ecosystems to approximate predisturbance conditions.
   In 1995, we sampled 21 sites throughout the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each site usually consisted of paired, well-vegetated and poorly vegetated areas. Total carbon and nitrogen, mineralized nitrogen tan index of seasonal availability) and available nitrate and ammonium were evaluated and compared. In 1996, we conducted a much more intensive survey on two Sierra Nevada soils (volcanic and granitic) over a range of vegetation cover classes. We have identified threshold amounts of total and mineralizable nitrogen that are significantly different between well-vegetated and poorly vegetated sites. Our results indicate that anaerobically mineralized nitrogen is correlated with plant cover on two Tahoe Basin soils. We suggest that a 1-10 cm depth is optimum for screening site fertility. The data indicate that, in wildland systems, extractable nitrate and ammonium are not reliable indicators of plant cover.
   The ongoing fertilizer/amendment component of this study uses laboratory soil leaching columns to compare N release rates and microbial respiration various materials in order to determine the suitability of those materials as long-term sources of nitrogen to disturbed sites.

AB Even 8 years after mining and smelting was abandoned in the district of Mansfeld (Central Germany), smelting residues, in particular flue dust ("Theisen sludge") from copper shale smelting, significantly contribute to the pollution of the environment. The extremely fine grained sediments are subject to erosion by wind and water. The most effective dissemination mechanisms are deflation (wind erosion), rain water "wash-off" and leaching. Environmentally significant pollutants derived from Theisen sludge comprise metals (zinc, lead, copper, arsenic, cadmium), PAH and radionuclides (Pb-210, Po-210). These pollutants can be found in lake and river sediments, in soils, in the surface water and in the groundwater of the former mining district. The most serious environmental hazards of Theisen sludge are (a) the pollution of the surface water and groundwater by harmful, soluble and bioavailable organic and inorganic compounds; (b) the mechanical erosion of metalliferous sediments in the mining area and their accumulation in the lakes of Mansfeld, a potential threat to wildlife and vegetation; (c) harm to human health by inhaling radioactive particles.
   A large part of the pollutants derived from the mining waste is immobilised in the former mining area by natural processes such as precipitation, sedimentation and adsorption. Lakes and wetlands act as a trap for particulates and secondary enrichments of metalliferous sediments are common. In anoxic lake sediments dissolved metals are precipitated and immobilised as sulphides. Carbonaceous soil, mainly loess, limestone waste rock and slag buffer acidic leachates from flue dust weathering. This leads to the natural formation of less soluble heavy metal carbonates, hydroxides and oxides. In some places storage minerals directly precipitate from mine dump leachates (glaucocerinite) and immobilise dissolved metals such as zinc, copper and nickel. Lab scale experiments show that natural precipitation of storage minerals can be optimised and finally immobilises about all dissolved metals. This has to be verified by extended field experiments.

AB Alteration of paleosols following development and burial is common. Chemical, physical and mechanical processes can weld younger to older soil profiles and affect the accumulation, dissolution, and reprecipitation of mineral material in soils. Soil properties most affected include texture and porosity, and, the content and distribution of soluble salts, amorphous silica, gypsum, carbonate, and clay. Organic matter retention is highly dependent on post-burial biologically controlled oxidation reduction and pH conditions. Processes such as erosion and deposition can truncate profiles or bury them either rapidly or extremely slowly. Effects of these and other processes on soil properties must be examined with care in paleosols that have been buried even for a short interval. This study presents several examples of soil properties which should be evaluated carefully and possibly avoided as indicators in paleoenvironmental reconstruction, paleosol classification, and regional stratigraphic correlation.

DE saprolite; Swaziland; gully erosion; reclamation; site properties
AB Investigations of hydrological, physical and chemical site properties were undertaken on saprolites in the Middleveld of Swaziland, Southern Africa, to determine the suitability of saprolites for reclamation following erosion and for agricultural use. The results show that their hydrological properties ape of great importance for plant growth after erosional phases and drought periods, leading to a stabilization of the land cover. Gullies deeply incised into the saprolite can be reclaimed by planting grass, shrubs, and tries due to favourable hydrological properties and the sufficient nutrient reserve of the saprolite. In spite of low nitrogen and organic carbon reserves, the suitability for agricultural use of eroded soils underlain by saprolites is good, especially in regions with a climatic water deficiency. However, because of the low structure stabilities of the saprolites, they are prone to erosion. Therefore, effective erosion control by local farmers is a precondition for a sustainable rehabilitation of eroded areas on saprolite and their further agricultural use.

DE greenhouse effect; soil erosion; global carbon cycle; conservation
   tillage; soil organic carbon
AB World soils play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Erosion-induced soil degradation affects about 1.0 billion ha of land area by water erosion and 0.5 billion ha by wind erosion. The most severe erosion occurs in the ecologically-sensitive ecoregions of Asia (mean erosion rate 18 Mg/ha/yr), South America (19 Mg/ha/yr) and Oceania (40 Mg/ha/yr). Accelerated soil erosion has severe impacts on both productivity and the environment. A principal off-site environmental impact is due to the disruption of the global carbon cycle, resulting in an erosion-induced efflux of about 1.14 Pg C/yr from soil to the atmosphere. Furthermore, pathways and fate of carbon buried in depressional or depositonal sites, and in lakes and reservoirs are not fully understood. Conservation effective land use and soil mangement systems offer a potential of carbon sequestration in soil and terrestrial ecosystems through: (i) increase in soil aggregation, (ii) improvements in water and nutrient use efficiencies, (iii) decrease in losses of soil organic carbon, and (iv) increase in biomass production. There is a wide range of technological options for soil conservation, e.g. mulch farming and conservation tillage.

   erosion phase
AB The movement and transformation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in soil has important implications for agricultural productivity, soil degradation, carbon sequestration, and environmental pollution. Intact monoliths of surface soil excavated from four erosion phases at three sites in central Ohio were subjected to 1 h laboratory rainfall of 30 to 40 mm h-1 intensity. Runoff, percolation water and sediment samples collected at 10 min intervals were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and SOC, respectively. Severely eroded phases had high runoff rates with short times to initiation of flow. Percolation rates were almost always higher than runoff rates initially but diminished to low; steady rates within 40 min of rainfall, indicating surface sealing and reduced infiltration. The erosion phase had no significant effect on runoff or percolation volumes from the soil blocks, though total runoff was greater than percolation. The DOC conentration of both runoff and percolation water peaked early during rain events, diminishing towards the end of the event suggesting rapid removal of accumulated soluble organic D upon re-wetting. Percolation water had significantly higher DOC concentrations that runoff suggesting water picked-up soluble OC as it moved through the surface soil. Total bedload and suspended sediment were higher than percolation sediment for all sites and erosion phases. However, SOC content of percolation sediment was typically higher that those of bedload or suspended sediment indicating that vertical translocation of SOC may be significant.

AB Major agricultural soils in three distinct eco-regions representing sub-humid/semi-arid, sub-humid and humid eco-regions were selected for studies on soil erosion and crop productivity relationships in Tanzania. Nutrient contents significantly decreased with increased surface erosion inmost soils. The levels for pH, Organic carbon (Oc), total nitrogen (Tot-N) were higher in slight and least eroded classes for all seven soils. Phosphorus (P) was extremely low in all soils in the sub-humid and semiarid/sub-humid eco-regions. Bulk density significantly increased with severity of erosion, and available water capacity significantly decreased with increased severity of erosion. Soil pH, texture and organic matter variously and significantly influenced crop yield. Maize and cowpea yield was significantly influenced by the extent of erosion. On average 64 kg/ha maize grain and 34 kg/ha cowpea grain was lost per cm topsoil loss for the studied soils. Cowpea was relatively less sensitive to changes in topsoil depth as compared to maize.

DE Northern Cameroon; sandy alfisols; conventional vs no-tillage; soil
   compaction erosion; restoration of productivity
AB On the sandy alfisols of the cotton belt of Northern Cameroon, conventional intensive cropping based on soil tillage and mineral fertilizers application does not prevent soil degradation or free farmers from shifting cultivation. The aim of this study was to characterize degradation of these soils under intensive cropping, and to develop ways for restoring the productivity of these degraded soils that have been rendered unsuitable for intensive cultivation. The study was based on evaluation of soil constituents, structure and functions as affected by time. Run-off plots were used in two locations at different stages of soil degradation.
   Degraded soils were characterized by a low organic carbon content (around 0.2%) in its upper 10 cm, a high erodibility, and a high compaction of the upper layers when not recently tilled. Restoration of productivity on these soils should start by aerating and stabilizing the compacted layers. Only then can fertilizer application and other improvements be profitable. Soil mulching after tillage and incorporation of farm manure, adoption of conservation tillage practices and short duration fallows, allow restoration of productivity on these degraded soils.

   hydraulic properties
AB The term 'soil seal' generally refers to a surface layer of soil with significantly reduced porosity and permeability resulting from rapid wetting of dry soil, raindrop impact, deposition of fine soil material, chemical dispersion, or to some combination of these processes. Subsequent drying of the soil can result in a layer with significantly increased strength that is commonly referred to as a soil crust. Seals or crusts can limit plant production by restricting infiltration of rainfall or irrigation water, by physically restricting seedling emergence and early root growth, or by restricting the gas exchange necessary for soil aeration. Soil seals that decrease infiltration rate will result in increased potential for surface runoff and for water erosion and other associated adverse off-site impacts. Prediction of the impacts of seals or crusts on the soil water balance is necessary for guiding improved land management.
   Soil surface hydraulic properties, surface roughness and depressional storage are critical factors in determining potential infiltration and run-off. Each of these can be significantly affected by surface sealing processes, but incorporating adequate description of their effects in water balance models can be problematic. Particular attention is given to modeling of the impact of sealing and crusting processes on soil hydraulic properties.
   Recent studies on measurement and prediction of the impact of cultivation and other land management practices in south-eastern Australia on the soil water balance are summarised. The results demonstrate that long term cultivation management practices have diminished organic carbon contents of topsoils and increased susceptibility to dispersion. However, a range of surface and subsurface properties including horizon depth, surface and subsurface hydraulic conductivity and macroporosity need to be taken into account as well as crusting if runoff is to be predicted. The practical significance of potential reductions in infiltration and increases in runoff due to declining surface hydraulic conductance during surface sealing under rainfall is illustrated for cultivated soil from Cowra in New South Wales, Australia using the SWIM model (Soil Water Infiltration and Movement) together with published soil and climatic data.

AB When converting grass-and haylands to cultivated crop production, care must be taken to conserve and maintain soil resources while considering economic issues. Methods of breaking sod can have a bearing on erosivity, physical and chemical properties of soils, and cost of production. Our objective was to compare three methods of converting crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) Schult.] hayland to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production vs. leaving the land for hay production. We initiated a study in 1990 on Dooley sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiboroll) near Froid in semiarid eastern Montana, USA. Plots, replicated three times, were 12- by 30-m oriented east to west on a noah-facing slope. We converted sod to cultivated crop production by: (1) moldboard plow, (2) toolbar with sweeps, (3) herbicides (no-till). Plots were fallowed until spring 1991 and then seeded to spring wheat each of the next four years. All wheat plots were fertilized with 224 kg ha(-1) of 18-46-0 in 1991 and 1992, and 34 kg ha(-1) nitrogen as 34-0-0 in 1993 and 1994. Grass was either fertilized same as wheat or not fertilized. Wheat yields averaged 2540 kg ha(-1) on tilled treatments and 2674 kg ha(-1) on no-till. Fertilized grass consistently out-yielded unfertilized, and averaged 3.2 Mg ha(-1) vs. 1.8 Mg ha(-1). Toolbar with sweeps had highest economic return of US$169.48 ha(-1) to pay for land, labor, and management. Moldboard plow had US$162.05 ha(-1). Because of herbicide costs, no-till only returned US$148.64 ha(-1). Unfertilized grass hay returned US$67.68 ha(-1) and fertilized grass hay, US$97.95 ha(-1). Results may be tempered because our wheat yields were high: a 2016 kg ha(-1) wheat yield would have returned the same as fertilized grass. Before converting grass- and hay-lands to small grains production, consideration must be given to such variables as sod conversion methods, management practices, labor requirements, market conditions, total precipitation and its temporal distribution, soil conditions, growth environment, soil conservation, and economics.

AB Our study of sediment accretion rates from four low tidal-range sites along the Gulf of Mexico does not support previous hypotheses concerning the relationship between tidal range and vertical accretion rates. The addition of our data to an earlier data set decreased the correlation between these variables, and all but one of our low-tidal range sites had positive accretion rates, contradicting previous studies which have predicted that low tidal-range sites would have negative net accretion rates. Additionally, in transects across the marsh, accretion rates decreased from low- to high-marsh stations; however, this appeared to be caused by changes in rates of organic matter accumulation, not mineral matter accumulation, as has been proposed in previous studies. Vertical accretion rates were more strongly correlated with organic matter accumulation rates than mineral matter accumulation rates, confirming previous studies which indicated the important role of sediment organic matter in determining sediment structure. These results do not imply that mineral matter is unimportant in maintaining the elevation of the marsh; mineral matter input affects organic matter production and sediment bulk density. There was little correlation between mineral and organic matter accumulation rates, with average organic matter accumulation rates for each site having little variation compared to the variation in mineral matter accumulation rates. This result supports a previous hypothesis that there may be a limit to annual rates of organic matter accumulation. Finally, the study indicates that the negative net accretion rates documented in Louisiana are not typical of other Gulf coast wetlands.

AB Recovery of degraded semiarid rangeland is influenced by the degree of soil erosion and changes in soil physical and chemical properties that follow the loss of herbaceous cover. The objectives of this study were to compare changes in physical and chemical properties of a chaparral soil protected from grazing for 18 years, and to evaluate these changes relative to succession and threshold paradigms. Litter and soil samples were collected beneath shrub live oak (Ouercus turbinella), birchleaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides) and open spaces between shrubs in a livestock exclosure and the surrounding grazed area. Additional soil was collected beneath shrub live oak and from open spaces between shrubs for a bioassay of soil fertility within the exclosure and the grazed area using oats (Avena saliva) as the indicator species. Percentage silt and clay were greater and percentage sand was lower within the exclosure. Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were greater in soil beneath mountain mahogany and from shrubless openings within the exclosure compared to the grazed area, but not beneath shrub live oak. Soil from shrubless openings in the exclosure produced greater oat shoot weights compared to soil from open spaces in the grazed area, but there was no difference in oat shoot weights between grazed and protected areas beneath shrub live oak. Shoot weights increased in response to nitrogen and nitrogen + phosphorus, but not phosphorus alone, indicating the site was primarily nitrogen limited. Improvements in soil physical and chemical properties within the exclosure did not result in recovery of herbaceous vegetation in open areas between shrubs. A very heterogeneous distribution pattern in soil properties, characterized by large differences between sails under shrubs compared to open areas between shrubs, was evident within the exclosure and in the grazed area, indicating the presence of a degraded ecosystem. Improvements in soil physical and chemical properties within the exclosure represent an upward trend within a stable threshold of lower productivity, rather than a slow return to climax condition.

AB We examined the influence of management on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and yield of wheat grain in semiarid Chernozemic and humid Gray Luvisolic soils. The Century model was tested with data obtained from long-term research plots cropped to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture and cereal-hay (CH). Century simulated changes in soil organic-C (DC) and organic-N (ON) within 10% of actual measurements taken over decades. Our analysis indicated that management and soil erosion affected the rime required for SOM to achieve new steady-state level (T-st). T-st ranged between 12 yr under wheat and 46 yr under CH cropping. Increasing the SOM content of degraded soils to new steady-state level appears to increase grain yield between 86 kg ha(-1) and 840 kg ha(-1).
   Wheat-fallow (WF) rotation plots receiving <10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), and with erosion >13.6 t ha(-1) yr(-1) degraded SOM. The average long-term yield of wheat grain (including new high yielding varieties) was maintained at < 910 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) under degraded SOM content. Well-fertilized continuous wheat (CW) and CH rotation plots with erosion <4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) aggraded SOM content, and maintained the long-term average grain yield at >1290 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Sustained OC levels were attained by returning 1030 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) as plant residue (roots + aboveground) and keeping soil erosion less than or equal to 12.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Sustainable crop production systems need to consider SOM dynamics and erosion as factors limiting grain yield even after introducing genetically improved wheat varieties.
