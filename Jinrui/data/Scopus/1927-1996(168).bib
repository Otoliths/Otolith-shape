abstract={The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of coffee tree population density on soil fertility levels after fourteen years of a field experiment. A field trial was established in 1977 at Londrina, State of Parana, Brazil, with four commercial coffee cultivars (Catuai Amarelo, Acaia, Icatu and Mundo Novo) in the following population densities: 893, 1020, 1190, 1429, 1786, 2381, 3571 and 7143 holes / ha with 2 trees / hole. In 1991 soil samples were collected from O to 20 cm soil depth from each plot for chemical analysis. Increasing plant population per unity of area increased soil pH , exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, available P and organic carbon, and decreased exchangeable Al. These changes in soil fertility were greater under Catuai Amarelo than any other coffee cultivars. Increasing soil surface cover by tree canopy, decresing soil erosion, increasing residue management, decreasing nutrient depletion by leaching and improving nutrient cycling were found to be the possible mechanisms envolved in soil chemical improvement with increasing coffee tree population density.},

abstract={A characterization of eroded soil properties, especially size, is required for proper usage of modern processbased soil erosion models. In a study addressing reclaimed mine land erodibility, over 350 measured eroded aggregate size distributions were collected from erosion plots created on reclaimed and nearby unmined soils at three separate strip mine sites. The experimental design allowed for a comparison of eroded aggregate size distributions as a function of land slope, run sequence, and reclamation treatment. No influence of slope was apparent, as distributions collected from plots constructed at 6% slope were coarser than those collected from 18% slope, but finer than those collected from 12%. Samples collected during extra inflow runs, in which runoff rates, flow velocity, and rill erosion were greatest, had coarser distributions than samples collected during rainfall only runs, which tended to have similar distributions. Distributions from reclaimed topsoil treatments were similar to nearby unmined soils and were distinct from subsoil reclamation treatments. At two sites, topsoil treatments had coarser distributions, while the converse was true at the third. Distributions taken from topsoil and unmined soil treatments were used to develop five regression equations to predict the percentage of total eroded soil mass falling into each of five size classes - clay, silt, and three sand sizes. A stepwise, multivariate regression technique was used to select the best independent variables from 30 soil parameters. Independent variables that proved to be significant in at least one equation include primary particle and water stable aggregate size distributions, bulk density, organic carbon, and soil moisture. The number of significant independent variables ranges from 11 to 15 and correlation coefficients (R2) range from 0.77 to 0.53, which is a general improvement over previously published prediction methods. © 1996 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.},

abstract={The organic carbon content and the particle size distribution of dispersed soils and sediments were studied in a 300 ha watershed in the Tala River Basin. San Pedro Department, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Samples were taken from the waterway area (sediments) and from the topsoil of the hillslope positions in the watershed. Sampling was performed in two periods under contrasting climate and management conditions. The organic carbon content of the sediments between sampling periods in the waterway were statistically different, whereas a significant organic carbon enrichment ratio was measured between the sediments and the soils in the hillslope positions. Larger silt content and less sand and clay content in the sediment relative to the hillslope soils were measured. The AGNPS model was employed to obtain estimates of the texture of the sediments sampled in several positions within the waterway area. Thus, the files of the model were fed with physiographic, edaphic, climate and management information from the watershed divided in 55 cells. The AGNPS estimated accurately the relationship between sand and clay content, and it underestimated the silt content of the sediments.},

abstract={Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally. The EPIC (Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator) model was used to examine the sensitivity of soil erosion (wind, water) and soil organic carbon (SOC) (15 cm and 1 m depth) across the US corn belt to changes in temperature (+2°C), precipitation (±10%, ±20%), wind speed (±10%, ±20%), and atmospheric CO2 concentration (350, 625 ppmv). One-hundred-year simulations were run for each of 100 sites under 36 climate/CO2 regimes. The 100-year regionally aggregated mean water erosion rates increased linearly with precipitation, whereas the wind erosion rates decreased and total erosion rates increased non-linearly. Increasing temperature by 2°C (with CO2 and mean wind speed held constant) decreased water erosion by 3-5%, whereas wind erosion increased by 15-18%. Total erosion increased with increased temperature. Increasing CO2 from 350 to 625 ppmv (with temperature increased by 2°C and mean wind speed held constant) had no effect on water erosion, despite increases in annual total and peak runoff; this was attributed to increased vegetation cover. Wind erosion decreased by 4-11% under increased CO2. Wind erosion was very sensitive to mean wind speed, increasing four-fold and decreasing 10-fold for a 20% increase or decrease in mean wind speed, respectively. This was attributed to a threshold effect. SOC to 1 m decreased 4.8 Mg-C ha-1 from an initial value of 18-1 Mg-C ha-1 during the 100- year baseline simulation. About 50% of this loss (2.3 Mg-C ha-1) was due to transport off-site by soil erosion. SOC in the top 15 cm decreased 0.8 Mg-C ha-1 from an initial value of 4.9 Mg-C ha-1. Increased temperature and precipitation accelerated these losses of SOC, whereas increased CO2 slowed the losses.},

abstract={Phase selective and sequential extraction techniques have been used to identify the residence sites of metals in a variety of surficial materials and to characterize different types of surficial geochemical anomalies. Based on analysis of C-horizon till, B-horizon till, and humus samples collected at each of approximately 65 sites in the Chisel Lake area, three different types of geochemical anomalies have been characterized. Firstly, mineralogenic anomalies, created by glacial erosion and transport are typified by uniformly high concentrations of Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn in all crystalline mineral phases of the B- and C-horizon tills, except exchangeable metals and carbonate. Secondly, hydromorphic/biogeochemical anomalies are characterized by elevated concentrations of Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn within the exchangeable metal and Fe/Mn hydrous oxide phases of B-horizon till and "insoluble organic" residue of humus. These metals are also highly concentrated within the soluble organic phase of humus. Thirdly, surface contamination is reflected in anomalous concentrations of Zn in the sulphide phase within the insoluble organic residue of humus. The presence of sulphide within this phase suggests airborne contamination related to mine dust from tailings and open pit mining operations.},

abstract={In the late Paleocene to early Eocene, deep sea benthic foraminifera suffered their only global extinction of the last 75 million years and diversity decreased worldwide by 30-50% in a few thousand years. At Maud Rise (Weddell Sea, Antarctica; Sites 689 and 690, palaeodepths 1100 m and 1900 m) and Walvis Ridge (Southeastern Atlantic, Sites 525 and 527, palaeodepths 1600 m and 3400 m) post-extinction faunas were low-diversity and high-dominance, but the dominant species differed by geographical location. At Maud Rise, post-extinction faunas were dominated by small, biserial and triserial species, while the large, thick-walled, long-lived deep sea species Nuttallides truempyi was absent. At Walvis Ridge, by contrast, they were dominated by long-lived species such as N. truempyi, with common to abundant small abyssaminid species. The faunal dominance patterns at the two locations thus suggest different post-extinction seafloor environments: increased flux of organic matter and possibly decreased oxygen levels at Maud Rise, decreased flux at Walvis Ridge. The species-richness remained very low for about 50 000 years, then gradually increased. The extinction was synchronous with a large, negative, short-term excursion of carbon and oxygen isotopes in planktonic and benthic foraminifera and bulk carbonate. The isotope excursions reached peak negative values in a few thousand years and values returned to pre-excursion levels in about 50 000 years. The carbon isotope excursion was about -2‰ for benthic foraminifera at Walvis Ridge and Maud Rise, and about -4‰ for planktonic foraminifera at Maud Rise. At the latter sites vertical gradients thus decreased, possibly at least partially as a result of upwelling. The oxygen isotope excursion was about -1.57‰ for benthic foraminifera at Walvis Ridge and Maud Rise, -1‰ for planktonic foraminifera at Maud Rise. The rapid oxygen isotope excursion at a time when polar ice-sheets were absent or insignificant can be explained by an increase in temperature by 4-6°C of high latitude surface waters and deep waters world wide. The deep ocean temperature increase could have been caused by warming of surface waters at high latitudes and continued formation of the deep waters at these locations, or by a switch from dominant formation of deep waters at high latitudes to formation at lower latitudes. Benthic foraminiferal post-extinction biogeographical patterns favour the latter explanation. The short-term carbon isotope excursion occurred in deep and surface waters, and in soil concretions and mammal teeth in the continental record. It is associated with increased CaCO3-dissolution over a wide depth range in the oceans, suggesting that a rapid transfer of isotopically light carbon from lithosphere or biosphere into the ocean-atmosphere system may have been involved. The rapidity of the initiation of the excursion (a few thousand years) and its short duration (50 000 years) suggest that such a transfer was probably not caused by changes in the ratio of organic carbon to carbonate deposition or erosion. Transfer of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere was probably not the cause, because it would require a much larger biosphere destruction than at the end of the Cretaceous, in conflict with the fossil record. It is difficult to explain the large shift by rapid emission into the atmosphere of volcanogenic CO2, although huge subaerial plateau basalt eruptions occurred at the time in the northern Atlantic. Probably a complex combination of processes and feedback was involved, including volcanogenic emission of CO2, changing circulation patterns, changing productivity in the oceans and possibly on land, and changes in the relative size of the oceanic and atmospheric carbon reservoirs.},

abstract={The amounts and types of extractable hydrocarbon components in sediment cores from the Rochester Basin of eastern Lake Ontario provide a record of environmental changes that have accompanied the settlement and population growth of the surrounding land areas. Sediments deposited prior to the mid- 1800s contain low concentrations of hydrocarbons that are dominated by land- plant wax components. Concentrations begin to rise in the late 1800s as erosion of soil and nutrients from watershed areas accelerated. This pattern continues into modern times. Episodes of enhanced aquatic productivity are sometimes recorded in twentieth-century sediments by the dominance of algal hydrocarbons, but land-plant components typically predominate. Petroleum residues begin to appear in sediments deposited in the late 1800's but remain minor constituents of the hydrocarbon contents of modern sediments in the Rochester Basin.},

abstract={The subhumid zone Alfisols of Nigeria are fragile, dominated by low-activity clays, and have inherently moderate to low fertility status. Following intensive use of the soils for crop and livestock production, the soils are being degraded by soil erosion, drought, complete removal of both crop and residues, improper management practices, and overgrazing. The present investigation was aimed at defining the soil properties and arresting their continued degradation. The study area is located in the savanna zone, near Kaduna, Nigeria. The study involved a reconnaissance survey at which four soil units were delineated. Typical profiles were studied in detail, characterized in the field and in samples obtained for physical or chemical analysis. The upland soils (crest to upper, upper to middle, and middle to lower slope positions) have shallow Ap, sandy clay loam and clay loam texture, and are plinthic and mottled in the subsoil horizons. The valley basin soils are loam, have a moderately thick surface horizon, are flooded at a shallow depth of 50 cm, and are mottled even at the surface horizons. Acidity of the upland soils is in the extremely acid range (pH 4.4.-4.8). In the valley basin, soil acidity is in the strongly acid range (pH 5.0–5.1). Organic carbon and total nitrogen values of the soils are generally moderate at the surface but decrease to low and very low values in the subsurface horizons. Cation exchange capacities of the soils are adequate to control leaching losses of soil nutrients, especially at the surface horizons. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={An on-farm study was conducted on 4 sites (A, B, C and D) in Ohio to compare soil properties of the surface horizon of an uncultivated and non-eroded (NE) wooded soil with those of cultivated and eroded soils for the same series. Cultivated soil comprised of slight (S), moderate (M), severely (SV) eroded phases on upper landscape position and depositional (DP) phase on the foot sloves. There were sienificant differences in soil moverties of surface horizon of the non-cultivated location (wooded site) compared with the cultivated locations. Mean soil buk density of the NE sites was 1.03 Mg/m3 compared with 1.40 Mg/m3 for cultivated land. Among different erosion phases on cultivated land the highest mean bulk density of 1.45 Mg/m3 was observed on phases and the lowest bulk density of 1.33 Mg/m3 on DP phases. Mean total porosity was 64.9% for NE sites compared with that of 46.7% for all cultivated sites. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K,) was highly variable and did not follow a consistent trend with regard to erosional phases. In general, however, laboratory measured K, was significantly higher for NE sites than cultivated sites, e.g., 24.6 cm/hr vs. 5.29 c&. Available water capacity (AWC) decreased with increasing severity of erosion among cultivated phases. The mean AWC was 0.33 (volumetric fraction) for NE, 0.23 for DP, 0.22 for S, 0.20 for M, and 0.19 for SV phase. Percentage water stable aggregation (WSA) and mean weight diamter (MWD) were generally high for NE and SV phases. Mean soil organic carbon (SOC) was 3.47% for NE, 1.13% for S, 0.98% for M, 0.97% for SV, and 1.45% for DP phases. Mean pH was 6.5 for NE, 6.4 for S, 6.1 for M, 7.2 for SV and 6.8 for DP phase. The available P was significantly lower on NE compare with cultivated land for sites A and C. The mean P content for soil at site A was 16 kg/ha for NE, 41 kg/ha for S, 46 kg/ha for M, 32 kg/ha for SV, and 59 kg/ha for DP phase. mean CEC was 12 cmol/kg for NE, 11 for S, 12 for M, 16 for SV, and 12 for DP phase. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={There is a comparatively large dry aeolian deposition in Negev Desert. The aim of this study was to quantify the contribution of this deposition and of deposited C and ? pools. Amounts of aeolian dry deposition and airborne particle concentration near the ground were measured. Total ? and dissolvable organic C were determined in the deposited soil surface layer and in airborne particles. The annual mean airborne particle concentration during 3 years varied from 100 to 113 μg m-3. The deposited airborne particle accumulation (difference between the total deposition and deflation-erosion) varied from 110 to 220 g m-1 yr-1 at the two sites studied. The C and ? content in the airborne particles and in the dry deposit was significantly higher in the loessical site than in the lithosol site. Considering the differences in the amounts of total dry deposition and the deposited C and N, it becomes possible to address the ecological role of the dry deposition in the ecosystem. © 1996 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={For a large set of major world rivers we established the empirical relations existing between the observed organic carbon fluxes and the climatic, biologic, and geomorphologic patterns characterizing the river basins. These characteristics were extracted from various ecological databases. The corresponding carbon fluxes were taken from the literature. Dissolved organic carbon fluxes are mainly related to drainage intensity, basin slope, and the amount of carbon stored in soils. Particulate organic carbon fluxes are calculated as a function of sediment fluxes, which depend principally upon drainage intensity, rainfall intensity, and basin slope. Although the drainage intensity is mainly related to the amount of precipitation and to mean temperature in the basin, slope is also retained as one of the controlling factors. Our empirical models result in a total organic carbon flux to the oceans of about 0.38 Gt per year globally. About 0.21 Gt carbon (Gt C) enter the oceans in dissolved form and about 0.17 Gt C in particulate form. We further regionalize fluxes with respect to major climates, different continents, and different ocean basins. About 45 % of the organic carbon is discharged from tropical wet regions. The major part of the dissolved organic carbon is discharged into the Atlantic Ocean, while the bulk of the particulate organic carbon is discharged into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. © Copyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract={Twenty-one severely eroded soils of SE Spain (Torriorthent xeric soils) were studied. These soils term a fragile system characterized by soils with a low density of plant cover (<5%), are loamy and occur in a semiarid climate. The soils formerly were used for agricultural purposes but were abandoned at least 15 years ago. These eroded soils had a low total organic: carbon content and their humic substances, humic acid carbon, and carbohydrates were lower compared with soils that had never been cultivated (natural soils). The variables in which the effects of erosion were particularly noted were those related with the active organic matter (respiration and watersoluble organic matter). Those eroded soils with higher salt content showed lower organic matter and carbohydrate contents. Only total nitrogen was correlated with the carbon fractions in the eroded soils.},

abstract={The presence of native prairies in the Lower Wisconsin River valley that have not been cropped affords a mean of comparison across undisturbed and managed ecosystems. A native prairie soil and a prairie converted to corn (Zea mays L.) and red pine (Pinus resinosa Aiton) plantations were studied to determine the influence of vegetation on soil-forming processes in the sandy landscape of the Lower Wisconsin River valley. Effects of afforestation and cultivation were determined by separating organic matter among particle-size and chemical fractions, differentiating among forms of extractable Fe and Al, and measuring dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Fe and Al in bulk precipitation, throughfall, and soil solutions at three depths. The soil under native prairie vegetation showed distinctive horizonation, including an umbric epipedon formed by melanization. Thickness of the A horizon was significantly less in the forested and cultivated soils than in the prairie soil. Greater amounts of the floatable fraction of organic C, fulvic acids, and Fe-organic complexes were present in the forested soils than in the prairie soil. Carbon concentration in the A horizon of the cultivated soil was significantly lower than in the prairie and forested soils, due to losses by erosion, decomposition, and DOC leaching. In the cultivated soil, the floatable and humin fractions showed the greatest decrease in C concentration compared with the prairie soil. Analysis of the solution data indicated leaching of soluble Fe-organic complexes under coniferous and corn vegetation, suggesting that afforestation and cultivation initiated incipient podzolization.},

abstract={Conversion to conservation tillage systems increases soil C content by reducing soil erosion and the rate of organic matter oxidation. We hypothesized that these effects could impact soil emission of CO2. This study (i) determined if CO2 emissions were reduced in the first years after conversion to no-tillage (NT) relative to conventional tillage (CT), (ii) evaluated whether differences in soil CO2 emissions between tillage treatments were related to soil temperature differences, and (iii) determined if soil CO2 emission measurements provided an early estimate of soil management practice impact on soil organic C. In 1992 and 1993, CT and NT plots were planted to small-grain cereals in Ottawa, Ontario, on a Dalhousie silt loam (mixed, mesic, Typic Endoaquoll). Fluxes were measured using closed chambers connected to a portable CO2 analyzer. During growing season 1992, the CO2 emissions varied from 0.05 to 0.18 mg CO2 m-2 s-1 with an average of 0.12 mg CO2 m-2 s-1 for CT and of 0.10 mg CO2 m-2 s-1 for NT. In 1993, the CO2 emissions varied from 0.06 to 0.35 mg CO2 m-2 s-1 with an average of 0.15 mg CO2 m-2 s-1 in both tillage treatments. Differences in soil CO2 fluxes between treatments were related to differences in soil temperature (r2 = 0.62), giving an estimate of 75 g C m-2 yr-1 difference in organic C transfers to the atmosphere between CT and NT. These results were validated using an independent estimation derived from long-term field experiments. Thus, soil CO2 flux measurements using dynamic closed chambers can provide early estimates of soil management impacts on soil organic C.},

abstract={In this study, the soils on the steeplands of Sabacan, Himaya, and San Jose, and on the uplands and alluvial areas of Musuan, were mapped, characterized morphologically and chemically, and classified based on the USDA Soil Taxonomy. The mineralogy of the various soil horizons has been determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The soils in the steepland and upland areas are classified as Typic Hapladalfs and Lithic Dystropepts. The floodplain is occupied by Typic Tropaquepts. The pH of the Ap horizons is moderately acid in Typic Hapludalfs and Typic Dystropepts and strongly acid in Typic Tropaquepts. The apparent cation exchange capacity is very high in these soils, characterized by low contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen, a very low available phosphorus and low base status. XRD analysis showed that gibbsite, quartz, halloysite and hydroxy interlayered 2:1 minerals are present in the clay fraction of all soils. TEM showed goethite as acicular crystals extending into pores like needles and lepidocrocite as highly elongated flakes found abundant in the sub-soils of Typic Tropaquepts. Typic Hapludalfs are deep, well-drained soils suitable for upland cultivation. Use of light implements would help minimize soil compaction during land preparation, and contour plowing would alleviate soil erosion hazards on these soils. The coarse-textured Lithic Dystropepts, which have a coherent underlying hard rock material at 50 cm of the mineral surface, would require proper drainage. A clayey texture and a massive structure with redoximorphic conditions pose aeration problems in the Typic Tropaquepts. These soils could best be utilized for lowland rice cultivation.},

abstract={Researchers and managers of semiarid rangelands rely on accurately determining soil properties for such tasks as establishing experimental plots, randomizing experiments, and developing mangement plans. Spatial variability of many soil characteristics is generally very high often resulting in erroneous assumptions concerning baseline soil properties. A field study was initiated to quantify the degree of spatial variability on a rangeland site in northeastern Colorado. The research site consisted of north- and south-facing slopes. Soil cores were collected at two depths from a 100-point grid laid out on each slope. Soil was analyzed for bulk density, particle size, calcium carbonate, and organic matter. Conventional and geostatistical analyses were conducted to compare variables within and between the two slopes. Spatial correlations were detected for percentage sand, clay, and calcium carbonate on the south-facing slope. Soil bulk density and percentage calcium carbonate in the soil were the most spatially correlated variables on the north-facing slope. The general notion that materials are eroded from the summit and deposited at the toeslope was not observed for either the north- or south-facing slopes. Eolian influence could have disturbed the typical soil landscape relationships on both slopes. The shallow depth of carbonates on the north facing slope implied long-term soil erosion at the site. Soil carbonates at these sites were distributed in a northwesterly to southeasterly direction on the leeward south-facing slope. Textural differences at the deeper soil layer implied that parent material also influenced soil variability. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Bench-terracing and Pinus afforestation have been extensively adopted as a means of soil conservation in Spain. This paper questions the appropriateness of this technology to extensively gullied soils and sediments of the Rana formation of central Spain. Bench-terracing has markedly altered the characteristics of the surface soil horizon as compared with nearby undisturbed matorral (natural scrub) vegetation. The construction process and resultant bench-terrace morphology have imposed a new, more spatially structured pattern in soil properties giving enhanced opportunities for overland flow generation and erosion. The terracing has exposed subsurface Bt horizons on inner treads and lower risers, producing a very compact clay rich surface horizon, low in organic carbon and of poor structural stability. Despite subsoiling hydraulic conductivity is very low. Excavated soil material is ploughed sideways to partially bury the original surface horizon and form part of the next riser downslope. Downslope drainage on the terraces gives rise to soil moisture contents approaching saturation on the lower risers and treads. Consequently only small rainfall inputs are required to initiate ponding and overland flow generation on sloping treads. Rainfall simulation demonstrates the importance of antecedent soil moisture to runoff generation, and the role of vegetation and organic matter in retaining water. Erosion bridge measurements show that erosion rates on sloping treads are as high as those recorded on gully sidewalls. Gully sidewall erosion is also accelerated by runoff waters shed from terrace treads. Management of native matorral vegetation may provide a more sustainable approach to soil conservation than bench terracing with afforestation.},

abstract={Chemical properties and nutrient availability were measured in soil profiles of fire-prone, semiarid, Mediterranean-type shrublands in Sierra de Almijara (SE Spain). The area is steep and has a xeric moisture regime. In such conditions, soils developed on kakiritized (sugarlike microstructure) dolomitic marble have distinctive features such as a very coarse texture, extremely high carbonate content, and low nutrient availability. These soils support site-specific shrubland communities with many dolomitophile plant endemisms. During the last decades, the area has been subjected to a high fire frequency and intensive erosion, causing deforestation and soil degradation. To assess the problem, we chose a four-stage chronosequence representative of these changes, which included examples ranging from a long-unburned, dense, mature garigue stand, to an open, frequently burned, regenerating, gorse scrubland. The linear increase in the fire frequency along the chronosequence was associated to a sharp depletion of soil-available nutrients, namely, exchangeable cations, extractable mineral N, and especially NaHCO3-extractable inorganic P. The NH4+/NO3- ratio decreased through the sequence. Organic matter contents were &gt;10%, and total N concentrations were &gt;4mg N g-1 in surface soils of the long-unburned garigue site, which contrasted with values of &lt;4% and 1 mg N g-1, respectively, in the most frequently burned, regenerating scrubland site. This decline of available nutrients is related to the slow recovery of the original garigue vegetation, or even substitution by other more degraded vegetation formations, that is observed in eroded sites, as well as with the lack of successful reforestation programs currently under way at the study site. © 1996 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Rainsplash is an important component of interrill erosion. To date, few studies have critically examined the linkages between aggregate entrainment by splash and associated nutrient flux. An Oxisol was used in laboratory rainfall experiments with two different antecedent moisture contents (AMC) and ten different rainfall energy flux densities (EFD). Splash and soil organic carbon (SOC) flux increased with increased EFD regardless of initial AMC. Aggregates were not transported in proportion to their content in the original soil matrix, those of 2000-4000 μm and < 105 μm were found to be the most resistant to splash. Energy required to detach 1 gC varied from a median of 1870 J for the 2000-4000 μm fraction to 120 J for the 425-850 μm fraction. Temporal variation in cumulative splash flux and carbon flux for various combinations of AMC and EFD indicated distinct patterns. Under dry AMC, splash increased during 1 h duration storms and this was explained by increased aggregate breakdown by air-slaking, decreased soil strength and increased credibility as soil moisture increased. Wet soil runs exhibited the opposite pattern of decreased flux with time, probably indicating a complex response to limited aggregate availability, increased seal development by raindrop compaction, and transient water layer effects in drop impact craters. The formulation of mass-based SOC enrichment ratios (ER) clearly indicated preferential detachment and transport of splashed aggregates between 250 and 2000 μm. A reliance of chemical transport models on concentration-based ER values can be misleading, because it is the balance between nutrient concentration and sediment quantity that is important for soil quality and non-point source modelling.},

abstract={Soil conservation and sustainability concerns, and a lack of markets for crop residues, have left producers with few alternatives for cereal residue export beyond cattle feed or livestock bedding. With the increasing producer use of minimum and zero-tillage systems, the management of crop residues has become an important issue. Opportunities for residue removal may exist provided markets are developed for the material and long-term soil sustainability concerns are addressed. Recent research on the effect of residue removal in Saskatchewan has shown that there is little or no impact on soil organic matter provided adequate fertilization is practised and tillage is reduced. Assuming that 750 kg h-1 of retained residue is adequate for erosion protection in reduced tillage systems, significant quantities of residues may be available for export from the Black Soil zone. The economic returns to producers are such that residue export is an attractive diversification option.},

abstract={The paper examines the relationships between soil aggregate stability, selected soil properties and land use in central Spain. Aggregate stability indices derived from three procedures were found to be significantly (p > 0.01) correlated with each other as well as with clay content, organic carbon and a range of water-soluble salts. Soils with a higher clay content have a lower aggregate stability. It appears that the presence of expandable clays has a major negative influence, although this impact is strongly modified by recent land-use history and contemporary land-management practices. Agricultural land, abandoned in the 1940s, was subsequently invaded by Cistus matorral or planted with Pinus. The most stable aggregates occur under matorral and may represent a lag of more resistant aggregates surviving past land-use-related erosional processes. Comparisons with aggregates under Pinus however suggest that Hydrophobic substances from the Cistus may have increased aggregate stability. Aggregates from areas remaining in cultivation are the least resistant although the stability envelope overlaps with areas under Pinus. These differences may be related to cultivation practices whereby clay-rich subsurface horizons characterized by higher proportions of expandable clays are drawn to the surface, and to enhancement of aggregate stability under forest by fungal hyphae.},

abstract={High concentrations of N, P, and organic C in water cause problems such as excessive eutrophication in reservoirs and bacterial growth in distribution systems. The aim of this study was to measure the export of N, P, and organic C in streams draining two grazed catchments with no point sources in the ML Lofty Ranges, South Australia, during 1 yr. Retreat Valley catchment (1.3 km2) is grazed by sheep, has steep topography, and loam over clay soils. Lawless catchment (3.0 km2) is flatter, grazed by dairy cattle, and has sand over clay soils. Rainfall and specific runoff were similar. Annual exports were 924 kg suspended solids ha-1, 9.0 kg N ha-1, 1.0 kg P ha-1, and 55 kg organic C ha-1 from Retreat Valley; and 40 kg suspended solids ha-1, 6.6 kg N ha-1, 1.1 kg P ha-1, and 66 kg organic C ha-1 from Lawless. In Retreat Valley, 33% of the N, 86% of the P, and 65% of the organic C was in particulate forms resulting from erosion; and 45% of the N was nitrate. In Lawless, 82% of the N, 76% of the P, and 92% of the organic C was dissolved. Of the dissolved N, approximately 93% was organic. Concentrations of P in both streams, and dissolved organic C in Lawless, exceeded desirable limits. A combination of management options, including management of grazing and fertilizer application, soil amendment, and subsurface drainage, could lead to reductions in nutrient exports.
The aim of this study was to measure the export of N, P, and organic C in streams draining two grazed catchments with no point sources in the Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia during 1 year. An assessment was also conducted to determine whether the amounts of nutrients exported were high enough to be of concern, and if so, to suggest what management options would be available to reduce their movement into streams. Overall, significant results were generated.},

abstract={The soils of the mountains and plains of Central Asia can be grouped into three formations in relation to the total reserves and the ratio between organic and mineral carbonic compounds in them: (1) carbonate-carbonic, (2) organic-carbonate-carbonic, and (3) highly organic-carbonic. A wealth of pedogenic carbonates from topsoils of arid plain territories is involved in eolian migration due to the activity of deflation processes. Erosion and deflation of soils within subarid foothills and low mountains provide for eolian and water migration of pedo- and lithogenic carbonates as well as of humus-enriched fine earth. Erosion and cryogenic deflation of high mountain soils in humid regions attributes to the runoff of humus- and silica-enriched substances in mountain rivers. Sediments suspended in waters of mountain rivers and irrigation channels are deposited on plain in the form of modern alluvial and irrigation sediments that contain twice as much humus as background Gray-Brown and Takyr-like desert soils.},

abstract={Five riparian herbaceous plants, Leonotis nepetaefolia, Cassia tora, Ageratum conyzoides, Parthenium hysterophorus and Sida acuta, dominant on the banks of the Rihand river at Renukoot (India), were selected to assess experimentally their quantitative role in conserving organic-C, Na, K and Ca. Young seedlings from the river bank were planted on sloping experimental plots made of alluvial soil. Simulated rainfall totalling 42.5 mm was applied at 300 mm h-1 on five vegetated and one bare plots. Runoff water and eroded soil were collected from each experimental plot in artificial reservoirs and their quantities were measured. The soil conservation value of the five selected species ranged between 33 and 84% while the water conservation value varied between 19 and 50%. The overall nutrient conservation value, based on the losses in runoff water and eroded soil taken together, varied from 30 to 83% for organic-C, 19 to 78% for Na, 13 to 72% for K and 29 to 52% for Ca under different species. Loss of these four nutrients in response to 42.5 mm simulated rainfall was much higher than their input through rainfall. Loss value for the nutrients were in following order: organic-C &gt; Ca &gt; K &gt; Na. The fraction of organic-C transported down the slope was higher in eroded soil (averaging 73%) and of exchangeable bases in runoff water (averaging 86% for Na, 82% for K and 90% for Ca). Flow-weighted concentrations of all the studied nutrients were consistently greater from bare stands. Number of fine roots was found to play greater role in the case of organic-C (92%; p &lt; 0.01) and Na (70%; p &lt; 0.05) runoff and their conservation by different plant species but canopy cover played greater role for K (58%; p &lt; 0.08) and Ca (90%; p &lt; 0.01).},

abstract={Crop residue management is a key consideration when attempting to optimize fertility in conservation tillage systems. Major factors affecting the impact of crop residues on nutrient availability include the chemical composition of the residue [e.g. carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio], residue placement, fertilizer placement in relation to residue and time. Greater surface accumulation of crop residues in reduced and no-till systems tends to slow decomposition of N-poor residues such as cereal straw, and crop N supply during the current year can be reduced by immobilization if the straw is incorporated close to the time of high crop demand. Similarly, placement of fertilizer directly in the surface straw residue can reduce fertilizer use efficiency due to greater immobilization. Greater immobilization in reduced and no-till systems can enhance the conservation of soil and fertilizer N in the long term, with higher initial N fertilizer requirements decreasing over time because of 1) reduced losses by erosion and 2) the build-up of a larger pool of readily mineralizable organic N. For N-rich residues, such as legumes, volatilization losses may be greater when these residues are left on the surface than when incorporated into soil. Leaching of soluble phosphorus and sulfur compounds from standing and surface-placed crop residues into the mineral soil below may be a significant pathway for recycling of these elements in no-till systems. Greater coverage of the soil surface by crop residues can increase soil moisture and affect soil biological activity related to nutrient turnover. Future research should address how above- and below-ground decomposition processes differ for a wider range of crop residues and nutrients, emphasizing both short and long-term nutrient recycling.},

abstract={A simple method was developed for estimating the carbon concentration of fulvic acid from soil extracts at pH 2. Visible absorbance (410 nm) was measured in 20 samples of fulvic acids from different regions of Argentina. Linear regression analysis of absorbance as a function of carbon concentration yielded a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.983**). The proposed method is expected to be useful in assessing changes in organic matter content as a result of different tillage systems, erosion, plant residues, etc. Copyright © 1996 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.},

abstract={Although accelerated rainfall runoff and soil erosion in inhabited mountain regions are often linked to cultivation practices on steep hillsides, fields that have been abandoned can pose an even greater risk of rapid runoff and soil erosion. This paper presents new evidence of land degradation resulting from land abandonment in the Ecuadorian Andes and examines the Andean case in light of recent research on land abandonment from the Pyrenees and Himalaya. The Ecuadorian data, based on 109 field rainfall simulation experiments, indicate that runoff and erosion rates on abandoned/fallow fields are significantly higher than those of cultivated lands. Analyses of total percent carbon show abandoned/fallow field soil samples to contain significantly less organic matter than those under other land uses. Continued degradation and high runoff coefficients in abandoned/fallow fields in both the Andes and the Pyrenees are linked to the ongoing, informal use of these lands for grazing. Active management strategies are required to reverse the resulting scenario of increasing land degradation.},

abstract={Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally. The Climate Change Action Plan commits the USA to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 106 x 106 Mg C yr-1 by the year 2000. One suggestion for reducing net emissions is to convert marginal grass pastures to pine (Pinus spp.) plantations in the South-Central USA. We used the Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model to estimate the amount of atmospheric C that could be sequestered by this suggested change in land use. Carbon flow dynamics at each of 100 randomly selected sites were simulated for 50 yr under two assumptions: (i) continuous pasture for 50 yr or (ii) pine plantations harvested every 25 yr. Carbon sequestered by conversion to pine plantations was calculated as the net change in off-site storage (i.e., in long-lived products and landfills), plus the change in soil organic C, plus (for the first harvest period) stand establishment. Average C-sequestration (±SE) was 40 ±2 and 18 ± 2 Mg C ha-1 for the first and second 25-yr harvest periods, respectively. In contrast, sequestration would have been 8.3 ± 0.6 Mg C ha-1 as soil organic C if the sites had been left in continuous pasture for 50 yr, or 3 Mg C ha-1 after correcting for release of C during manufacture of N-fertilizer. Extrapolated to the region, conversion of 3.6 x 106 ha of marginal grass pasture to pine plantations could sequester 5.6 x 106 C yr-1 for the first 25 yr and 1.1 x 106 Mg for the second 25 yr. If all types of marginal agricultural land in the region (4.6 x 106 ha) were converted to forestry, the corresponding sequestration rates would be 7.4 x 106 and 1.4 x 106 Mg C yr-1. In contrast, maintaining the land in continuous pasture would sequester 0.3 x 106 Mg C yr-1.},

abstract={The beneficial effect of organic matter on soil aggregate stability is well documented. Alley cropping has been suggested as a possible alternative to maintain soil organic matter content in cropping systems without fallowing the land. The objective of this study was to asses the effect of alley cropping on dry and wet soil aggregate stability on land degraded by shifting cultivation. The aggregate size distribution by dry sieving, aggregate stability by wet sieving, soil organic Carbon content and soil bulk density were measured following two and three years of alley cropping with Gliricedia (Gliricidia sepium) and Pigeon pea (Cajanas cajan) in a tropical Rhodustalf. Alley cropping increased the mean aggregate diameter and water stability of soil aggregates. The mean aggregate diameter obtained from dry sieving increased from 1.3 mm of the control to 2.68 and 3.11 mm after three years in Pigeon pea and Gliricidia alley cropped plots, respectively. This is an indication of resistance to wind erosion in alley cropped plots. The wet aggregate stability which shows the resistance to erosion by water also increased in alley cropped plots. These increases were significant after three years of hedge row establishment. The increase in soil organic C in alley cropped plots contributed to the higher dry and wet aggregate stability, and decreased soil bulk density. The improvement was higher in plots alley cropped with Gliricidia than Pigeon pea. This study shows the importance of ally cropping in increasing aggregate stability of degraded sandy soils which in return reduce erosion by wind and water. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={We describe a fully automatic image analysis system capable of measuring cell numbers, volumes, lengths, and widths of bacteria in soil smears. The system also determines the number of cells in agglomerates and thus provides the frequency of dividing cells (FDC). Images are acquired from a confocal laser scanning microscope. The grey images are smoothed by convolution and by morphological erosion and dilation to remove noise. The background is equalized by flooding holes in the image and is then subtracted by two top hat transforms. Finally, the grey image is sharpened by delineation, and all particles above a fixed threshold are detected. The number of cells in each detected particle is determined by counting the number of local grey-level maxima in the particle. Thus, up to 1,500 cells in 10 fields of view in a soil smear are analyzed in 30 min without human intervention. Automatic counts of cell numbers and FDC were similar to visual counts in field samples. In microcosms, automatic measurements showed significant increases in cell numbers, FDC, mean cell volume, and length-to-width ratio after amendment of the soil. Volumes of fluorescent microspheres were measured with good approximation, but the absolute values obtained were strongly affected by the settings of the detector sensitivity. Independent measurements of bacterial cell numbers and volumes by image analysis and of cell carbon by a total organic carbon analyzer yielded an average specific carbon content of 200 fg of C μm -3, which indicates that our volume estimates are reasonable.},

abstract={Soils of the Argentine humid pampa region are usually weakly structured due to its high silt content. Selecting crop sequence or tillage systems are an alternative in small farms for the protection of the soil against physical degradation and erosion given that conservation practices, grass meadows, and fertilizers are expensive and therefore rarely used. Evaluation of selected soil properties was conducted on soil sampled from a long-term tillage experiment with continuous soybean established in 1975 on a Typic Argiudoll silty loam soil in Argentina. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage with moldboard plow (CT), chisel plow (CP), and no till (NT). A comparison with continuous corn under NT was also carried out. Sampling was performed after the emergence of both crops in 1990. Tillage and cropping treatments affected properties related to soil slacking and dispersion to a greater extent than they did on aggregate size distribution. According to the De Leenheer and De Booth index, aggregate stability within soybean soil classified as bad for CT, unsatisfactory for CP, and very good for NT, whereas the soil with corn under NT classified as excellent. The no tillage treatment within soybean had significantly more organic carbon in the 0–5 cm depth than CP or CT. Soil respiration was significantly higher in NT than in CT in the surface layer, while CT showed higher values in the 10–15 cm depth. Tillage treatments did not significantly affect microbial biomass under soybean cropping. The effect of monoculture corn versus monoculture soybean under NT on soil respiration, biomass and organic carbon was not significant. Soil pH in the 0–5 cm depth under soybean was in the order NT > CP > CT, whereas the soil with corn under NT was more acid than the soybean soil (P=0.05). Cation exchange capacity and exchangeable bases followed a similar trend. Organic carbon (0–5 cm depth) and aggregate stability were significantly correlated when samples from all treatments were considered. © 1995, MCB UP Limited},

Soil carbon affects plant relationships through its direct and indirect impact on mineral solubility, exchange capacity, nutrient availability, moisture supply, aggregate formation and soil erosion. There are twenty seven individually authored papers. Commencing with papers exemplifying the function of carbon in soil organic matter, subsequent papers review recent approaches to management and preservation and of forest resources, for example in Douglas fir and red alder forests. A concluding chapter provides a perspective on the evolution of forest soil science. -from Publisher},

For this purpose, a climatological gradient, with higher precipitation and lower temperatures with increasing altitude, was selected as study area in the South East of Spain. By means of rainfall simulation experiments and the study of soil profiles, relationships between soil physical and chemical properties, erosional response of soils and climate could be established. It was found that some soil properties improve upwards along the gradient, where higher amount of precipitation and lower temperatures occur. Other soil properties, like organic matter and carbonate content, beyond which the erosional response of soils increase or decrease have been found. © 1995.},

abstract={Soils of northeastern Nigeria (subject to wind erosion) were studied for erodibility. Samples of the surface soil were analyzed to determine the percentages of sand, silt, clay, organic carbon, and calcium carbonate and the aggregate stability and size distribution. The intrinsic and dynamic soil properties contributed to the erodibility of the soils. The sandy northern part of the study area had higher percentages of fine sand and lower percentages of silt, clay, and organic carbon, quite variable amounts of calcium carbonate, and lower aggregate stability and size distribution in comparison with the southern half of the study area. Soils in the south were more stable, with larger nonerodible size distribution and 50% less wind-erodible fraction than the north. The computed soil-erodible fraction from soil properties was highly correlated fr = 0.89, p < 0.01) with the measured erodible fraction. This implies that soil erodibility can be computed from the soil’s physical and chemical properties for northeastern Nigeria when a standard compact rotary sieve is not available. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Soil-surface seals and crusts resulting from aggregate breakdown reduce the soil infiltration rate and may induce erosion by increasing runoff. The cultivated loess areas of northwestern Europe are particularly prone to these processes. Surface samples of ten tilled silty loamy loess soils, ranging in clay content from 120 to 350 g kg-1 and in organic carbon from 10 to 20 g kg-1, were packed into 0.5 m2 plots with 5% slopes and subjected to simulated rainfall applied at 30 mm h-1. The 120 minutes rainfall events were applied to initially field-moist soil, air-dried soil and rewetted soil to investigate the effect of soil moisture content prior to rainfall. Runoff and eroded sediments were collected at 5 minutes intervals. Aggregate stability of the soils was assessed by measuring particle-size distribution after different treatments. All soils formed seals. Runoff rates were between 70 and 90% by the end of the rainfall event for field-moist plots. There were large differences between soil runoff rates for the air-dried and rewetted plots. Interrill erosion was associated with runoff, and sediment concentration in runoff readily reached a steady-state value. Measurements of aggregate stability for various treatments were in good agreement with sealing, runoff and erosion responses to rainfall. Runoff and erosion were lower for air-dried plots than for field-moist plots, and were either intermediate or lowest for rewetted plots, depending on soil characteristics. Soils with a high clay content had the lowest erosion rate when they were rewetted, whereas the soil with a high organic-carbon content had the lowest erosion rate in air-dry conditions. The results indicate the complexity of the effect of initial moisture content, and the interactions between soil properties and climate. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Effects of millet stover residue (0, 500, and 2000 kg ha-1) on wind erosion and surface soil properties were determined from 1991 to 1993 at the ICRISAT Sahelian Center in Niger, West Africa. Soil flux 0.1 m above the ground was significantly reduced with 2000 kg ha-1 residue but not with 500 kg ha-1. Topographic measurements indicated that soil removed from the soil surface was less with either residue level than in the control. After 2 y, the soil surface (0-0.01 m) of both residue treatments had less coarse sand than the control, but more fine sand and clay, more organic carbon and an increased cation exchange capacity. The organic-C content of blown material was greater than that of surface soil. An amount of 500 kg ha-1 residue can be considered useful for soil conservation, but 2000 kg ha-1 are required for a significant reduction of soil flux caused during severe wind erosion events. © 1995.},

abstract={Shelterbelt planting is often recommended as a means to reduce wind erosion. Six sheltered and three unsheltered fields representing moderately coarse to moderately fine textured soils were sampled along transects to determine the effects of the belts on soil wind erosion and soil properties.137Cs measurements indicated that shelterbelts about 6 m tall and 200 m apart considerably reduced off-field soil losses from moderately coarse and medium textured soils. Off-field soil losses from unsheltered moderately fine textured soils were low and similar to those from sheltered fields. Shelterbelts did not prevent in-field redistribution, and soil deposition was evident out from the shelterbelts for about 20 m. Organic C and 15-bar water content were increased, and bulk density decreased, in a strip about 10 m wide adjacent to the belts. Increased biomass production from the shelterbelt and its grass edge are probably the main cause for the increased organic C content. Decreased bulk electrical conductivity indicated increased leaching out to about 15 m from the belt. Leaching has also decreased the pH of the surface soil but has not affected the depth to carbonates. © 1995 Williams &amp; Wilkins.},

Organic C concentrations in the 0- to 15-cm depth were 11% lower in the FW and FWW treatments than in the W treatment from 1967 to 1992. Organic C concentrations in the 15- to 30-cm depth were not affected by treatment, but varied among sampling years due to differences in effective sampling depth. Most losses of soil organic C due to introduction of a fallow system occur within two decades, and that further loss of organic C is negligible provided soil erosion is minimal. -from Authors},

abstract={Maintaining soil stability and normal water and nutrient cycles in desert systems is critical to avoiding desertification. These particular ecosystem processes are threatened by trampling of livestock and people, and by off-road vehicle use. Soil compaction and disruption of cryptobiotic soil surfaces (composed of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses) can result in decreased water availability to vascular plants through decreased water infiltration and increased albedo with possible decreased precipitation. Surface disturbance may also cause accelerated soil loss through wind and water erosion and decreased diversity and abundance of soil biota. In addition, nutrient cycles can be altered through lowered nitrogen and carbon inputs and slowed decomposition of soil organic matter, resulting in lower nutrient levels in associated vascular plants. Some cold desert systems may be especially susceptible to these disruptions due to the paucity of surface-rooting vascular plants for soil stabilization, fewer nitrogen-fixing higher plants, and lower soil temperatures, which slow nutrient cycles. Desert soils may recover slowly from surface disturbances, resulting in increased vulnerability to desertification. Recovery from compaction and decreased soil stability is estimated to take several hundred years. Re-establishment rates for soil bacterial and fungal populations are not known. The nitrogen fixation capability of soil requires at least 50 years to recover. Recovery of crusts can be hampered by large amounts of moving sediment, and re-establishment can be extremely difficult in some areas. Given the sensitivity of these resources and slow recovery times, desertification threatens million of hectares of semiarid lands in the United States. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Four soils that formed in 1- to 3-m thick tephra and eolian materials of various origins were studied. The soils have low bulk density, and Atterberg limits characteristic of field-moist Andisols. Soil reaction ranges between pH 5.6 and 6.7. Organic C contents are high but erratic. The cation-exchange capacity is generally high. These Andisols developed from sediments of complex history consisting of tephra layers deposited during episodic volcanic events that are interstratified with eolian polycycled materials of glacial-fluvial and andic origin. All the pedons were classified as Haplocryands. More than 60 000 km2 of Andisols may occur in Iceland, which would constitute 5 to 6% of all Andisols in the world. -from Authors},

The runoff and soil loss reduction promoted by surface roughness was statistically significant; 70% of total water loss and 68% of interrill erosion control was achieved in the rough plots compared to the very smooth plots. In contrast, the effect of the aggregate stability was not outstanding because 63% difference in soil degradation level promoted only 25% reduction in the runoff volume and no effects on total soil loss. The enrichment ratio corresponding to the organic carbon content of the sediments was inversely correlated with the amount of soil loss. -from English summary},

abstract={Accelerated erosion can have adverse effects on soil properties and crop yield. Therefore, an onfarm evaluation of the effects of past soil erosion on productivity was done for a Miamian soil (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) in central Ohio in 1991. Three levels of soil erosion identified by a field survey and topsoil depth included slight (20-25 cm topsoil depth), moderate (15-20 cm) and severe erosion (10-15 cm). Soybean yield and soil properties under these conditions were compared with those for uneroded soil (wooded conditions with topsoil of 25-30 cm depth) and for deposition sites (30-35 cm depth). Soil properties measured included bulk density, particle density, organic carbon contents, infiltration capacity, and moisture retention at different suctions. Bulk density of 0 to 10 cm depth was significantly low in uneroded control (1.20 Mg/m3). High bulk density of 1.45 to 1.49 Mg/m3 was observed in moderately and severely eroded phases. The moisture retention at 0.03 MPa (0.47 V V) was the highest in uneroded control. The highest available water capacity of the 0 to 10 cm layer (0.16 to 0.17 V V) was observed for wooded control and slight erosion phase. Total aggregation was also the least on slightly eroded phase. Soil organic carbon content did not differ among three erosional phases with a 0 to 10 cm depth mean value of 1.03% compared with 1.83% for deposition and 2.93% for wooded soils. Similar trends were observed for the 10 to 20 cm depth. Concentrations of exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg and total CEC increased with increasing degree of erosion for both depths. There were no differences in CEC of the 0 to 10 cm depth for severely eroded and wooded soils. The rainfall received during 1991 was below normal. There were no differences in soybean yield among slight, moderate and severely eroded phases. Because of severe crusting and drought stress, crop stand was poor on slightly eroded plateau soils. Adverse soil physical conditions, low soil organic carbon content, severe crusting, and drought were likely responsible factors for low yields on slightly eroded plateau soils. Soybean grain yield was 1.5 Mg/ha for slight erosion, 1.4 Mg/ha for moderate erosion, 1.6 Mg/ha for severe erosion, and 3.1 Mg/ha for deposition soil. There were no differences in grain yield or biomass production among slight, moderate or severe eroded phases. The highest yields of soybean obtained on deposition sites were attributed to the favorable soil moisture regime during this unusually dry growing season of 1991 in central Ohio. © 1995.},

abstract={Legislation requiring the rehabilitation of new opencast coal mines came into effect in New South Wales, Australia, in 1973. Mining companies now stockpile original topsoil which is later spread with fertilizer over re‐shaped overburden and waste carbonaceous material. Problems in successfully revegetating new surfaces are exacerbated by the thinness and infertility of natural soils, which are deficient in phosphorus and moderately acid. Revegetation has not been successful on untreated mine waste and overburden. This study provides a general overview of some aspects of post‐rehabilitation soil chemistry and vegetation on these soils. A limited number of samples, collected from three mine sites having different rainfall and varying ages of rehabilitated areas, were tested for pH, EC, organic carbon, total phosphorus and available aluminium. Rehabilitated areas were all characterised by very low levels of total phosphorus, neutral pH, and variable and relatively low organic carbon, and some showed aluminium toxicity. Heavy application of gypsum at one of the steeper sites was associated with acid pH, high EC values, low total P, Al toxicity, some soil erosion and little plant cover. Except for this site, the variable vegetation cover at the sites studied seemed adequate for long‐term re‐establishment, despite serious weed invasion at some non‐studied sites, soil loss on newly re‐formed surfaces, and generally poor natural and rehabilitated soils.

abstract={Up to 57% of the organic carbon, approximately 4% of the inorganic mercury, and nearly 71% of the methylmercury from the humic horizon of a flooded podzol were transferred to the water column and transported outside the experimental perimeter in the form of particulate matter after one resuspension event. In contrast, total dissolved mercury concentrations in the water column decreased during the resuspension event as a result of scavenging by suspended particles. Resuspension and erosion processes along the exposed shores of a recently impounded reservoir may accelerate the transfer of mercury, primarily as methylmercury, from flooded soils to predatory fish.},

abstract={In the Sierra de Carrascoy (Murcia, southeastern Spain), ilimerized soils appear locally with different characteristics from those of the dominant soils. These ilimerized soils are relicts of more stable geomorphological surfaces. Four representative pro- fdes were studied for evaluating their pedogenetic processes and to classify them typologically. Analytical determinations were made of organic carbon, total nitrogen, calcium carbonate equivalent, pH, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, and particle size. Determinations were made of free iron oxide extracted with sodic hydrosulfite, and total iron, silicon, and aluminum oxides. The profiles are of a A-Bt-Ck or A-Bt-R type with a pronounced reddish color (2.5YR or SYR). The soils have an average organic matter content of 19.6-44.5 g kg-1 in the surface horizons and, in general, are totally decarbonated. The cation exchange capacity is highest in the argillic horizons (16.9-25.0 cmolkg-1), and their electrical conductivity is generally low. They have a Bt horizon (40.2-62.8% clay), a relict of an ancient pedogenesis where cutans, retraction cracks, and slickensides are visible. The ratio of free Fe2O3 to total Fe203 is highest in these argilluviation horizons. These soils indicate that different climatological conditions existed in the past, which made decarbonati- zation, rubefaction, and argilluviation possible. More recent processes of erosion and/or accumulation and recarbonatization have acted on these paleosols (classified as Xerollic Paleargids and Calcic Rhodoxeralfs). © 1995 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Information on spatial distribution of soil properties in a landscape is not only required for soil mapping and classification but also for soil management. Spatial patterns of soil properties in a landscape are the results of systematic variations in pedogenic processes controlled by environmental factors of which landscape position is important. In northeast Brazil, Lithosols (Ustorthents) whose surface horizons are directly underlain by lithic or paralithic contacts occupy upper slope positions with steep gradient; the Cambisols (Ustropepts) occupy the mid- and lower slope positions. In some cases Non-Calcic Brown soils/Planosol (Haplustalfs) occupy lower slopes. We examined the properties of two contiguous hillslopes in granitic and gneissic saprolite to determine whether there were any systematic variations among landscape positions and to interpret pedogenesis in the hillslopes. Particle size distribution, and the Ti content of sand plus silt and saprolite showed that the two hillslopes were formed on different parent materials. At Site 1, soil property variations along the slope, measured by standard deviation from the means, were attributed to variability in parent material rather than to landscape position. Except for solum thickness, which increased systematically downslope, variations in sand, clay, ECEC and pH were not related to landscape position. Increasing solum thickness downslope was explained by the effect of erosion on the upper, and deposition at the lower slopes. Silt and organic carbon contents at Site 1, and Feo and Fed contents at Site 2 significantly decreased downslope. One possible explanation for this trend, in addition to erosion and deposition, is the effect of slash and burn agriculture on the lower slopes, and the changes in redox conditions caused by periodic waterlogging. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Extensive rangelands of North America are occupied by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis [H.B.K.] Lag. ex Griffiths) associated with broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [Pursh.] Shinners). The role of these species on soil and water protection on rangeland watersheds is not well documented. The objectives of this research were: to study spatial variation on runoff and interrill erosion on areas with blue grama and broom snakeweed, and to find soil and plant variables that have major influences on such processes. A rainfall simulator was used to estimate runoff and to determine interrill erosion. Runoff and interrill erosion were lower under clumps of blue grama, followed by transition sites of blue grama-bare ground, and bare ground areas. Coppice dunes of broom snakeweed had lower runoff and interrill erosion, followed by transition sites of broom snakeweed-bare ground, and interspaces with bare ground. Grass basal cover, organic carbon, clay content, bulk density, sand content, and cryptogam cover were the most influential factors affecting runoff and interrill erosion.},

abstract={Evidence of Late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironmental change in the northern hinterland of the KwaZulu-Natal province, eastern South Africa, is preserved within a widespread sequence of colluvium and intercalated palaeosols, comprising the Masotcheni Formation. Palaeosol profile characteristics and micromorphological features are described for the full stratigraphic succession, preserved at the St Paul's donga reference site and other comparative exposures, permitting the interpretation of pedogenic processes active on hillslopes during the polycyclic accretion of colluvial sediments blanketing many hillslopes in the region. The importance of soil erosion and the transport of pre-weathered sediment and pedoreelict aggregates is highlighted. The 'elu-illuviation' particle translocation process, commonly synchronous with periodic Fe mobilization and reprecipitation, was active at differing intensities in all of the palaeosols studied. The palaeoclimatic implications of the aforementioned processes during the past ∼120 ka are placed in chronological context using a series of radiocarbon dates from palaeosol organic matter and soil carbonates and infra red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating of the parent colluvium. The dating framework permits generalized interpretation of the periodicity of erosional and colluvial events as well as the period of existence of palaeosol landsurfaces, which is of relevance when interpreting the age of similar soils on the current landsurface. © 1995.},

abstract={A 38-m well section near Lanzhou at the semiarid western margin of the Loess Plateau, China, contained a continuous, high-resolution loess-paleosol sequence spanning the last 130,000 yr. Depth functions of micromorphological features, magnetic susceptibility, calcium carbonate, organic carbon, and median grain size provide the basis for pedosedimentary and associated paleoenvironmental reconstructions of three paleosol complexes (S1, Sm, and S0). Each pedosedimentary stage reflects the interaction of changing intensities of controlling monsoonal forces. Three periods of reduced dust inputs and enhanced pedogenic activity, notably bioturbation and weak leaching, can be identified from within the S1 pedocomplex. These “soil-forming intervals” were separated by phases of varying land surface instability characterized by arid dust deposition, semiarid accretionary pedogenesis, water reworking, and crust formation, or even freeze-thaw modification. The Sm pedocomplex represents an interval of relatively rapid dust accumulation with only minimal syndepositional modification and minor pedogenic alteration at ephemeral land surfaces. The S0 pedocomplex is clearly more pedogenically developed, although erosion, reworking, and mixing by water have partly homogenized the property depth functions. © 1995 Academic Press.

abstract={The objective of this research was to determine the effects of tillage systems on selected chemical properties of a sloping and eroded soil which had previously been in sod. A tillage project was initiated in the spring, 1989 in southern Illinois on a soil with a root-restricting fragipan. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were grown on the plot area on a yearly rotation system. Prior to the application of lime or tillage treatments the 0–15 cm Ap horizon had a pH of 6.3, organic carbon (C) of 1.4 g/100g, and CEC equal to 17 meq/100g. Lime had been surface applied early in the spring of 1989 prior to moldboard (MP) and chisel (CP) plowing. Moldboard plowing had lower pH than the other treatments in the 0–5 cm layer in 1989 due to the moldboard plow mixing low pH subsoil material into the 0–5 cm layer and mixing surface applied lime into the 5–15 cm layer. During the 4th year, organic C was lowest for MP (1.28 g/100g) and highest for no tillage (NT) (1.65 g/100g), with CP having organic C content of 1.52 g/100g in the 0–5 cm layer. The differences in organic C were attributed to the effects of incorporation of plant residues below the 0–5 cm layer in the moldboard and chisel plow treatments. Effects of tillage on organic C content were not significant in the 5–15 cm layer. Soil phosphorus (P) (Bray P1) and extractable potassium (K) were stratified, with the largest amounts of these two elements found within the top 5 cm of soil. In general, tillage did not have any significant (P=0.05) effect on either extractable calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg). Differences were observed in exchangeable ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 --N) by tillage treatments and were affected by soil moisture content and previous crop residues. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) was lower for MP at the 0–5 cm layer as compared to NT and CP in the 3rd year. At the 5–15 cm layer CEC was lower for NT as compared to CP and MP. The differences in CEC were attributed to the observed differences in organic C and possibly the effects of moldboard and chisel plow mixing subsoil materials slightly higher in clay content into the Ap horizon. In 1989, corn grain yield for NT was significantly lower than MP and CP. In 1990, 1991 and 1992 the crop yields by tillage treatment were not significantly different. Any conversion of conservation reserve land from sod into NT corn and soybean production could experience similar management problems and corn yield reductions the first year. The initial yield advantage MP system had the 1st year did not occur the last three years. Based on four years of observation, no-till and chisel plow systems may better maintain long-term productivity of sloping soils than moldboard plow systems because of changes in distribution and availability of nutrients and organic C in the 0–5 cm layer, reduced soil erosion, and yield trends. © 1994, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={The cumulative extent of soil redistribution by erosion and tillage was measured by comparing the 137Cs content of a soil under intensive potato production with that of an undisturbed forest soil. Soil redistribution rates estimated from 137Cs contents for the cultivated site varied from a loss of as high as 19.0 kg m-2 year-1 (190 t ha-1 year-1) to a gain of as much as 4.3 kg m-2 year-1 (43 t ha-1 year-1), with an average of 5.3 kg m-2 year-1 (53 t ha-1 year-1) soil loss. Measured soil 137Cs content and calculated soil loss (and deposition) were both found to be correlated with total potato yield (P &lt; 0.01), and with tuber specific gravity (P &lt; 0.05), in the two years of yield measurements (1991 and 1992). These years had near normal growing season precipitation, but contrasting distribution patterns of precipitation during the growing season. Estimated soil loss and gain were also correlated (P &lt; 0.01) with soil organic carbon and soil phosphorus contents. It is concluded that soil redistribution within the site, caused by either water erosion or tillage, or a combination of both these processes, had a marked effect on soil productivity. © 1994.},

Water repellency was most severe on the FC I soils (median clay content 1 -5%), with 66% of samples having water repellency based on the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test &gt;10 s. Corresponding values for the FC II and III soils (2-5%, 4-0% clay) were 37% and 20%. Water repellency did not occur on the most clayey FC IV (8-1% clay) and FC V (22-1% clay) soils. Following stratification of Ap horizon soils by 1% increments of clay content, highly significant linear relationships occurred between log [water drop penetration time (WDPT)] and log [organic carbon (OC)] for the 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4% clay classes, these respectively explaining 50, 35 and 37% of the variation in water repellency. The role of organic carbon in promoting water repellency decreases markedly with increasing clay content, with WDPT being proportional to OC4.5, OC3.9 and OC3.0 for each of these clay classes. A multivariate relationship using measures of amorphous iron, clay and organic matter explained 63% of the variation in water repellency, and this multivariate dependency provides an explanation of the poor bivariate relationships between either clay or organic carbon content and water repellency reported in previous studies. There is a strong geomorphic control of the clay content in the soil surface horizons. Given the effect that clay content has on water repellency, the susceptibility of soils to water repellency can be mapped across farms, with the actual expression of water repellency depending on soil organic matter content, and hence land use. Such discrimination will allow the prediction of water erosion hazard and identify soils requiring ameliorative treatments. © 1994, CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The data base of soil information for the wind erosion equation (WEQ) was primarily from the Central Great Plains. To test soils outside the great Plains, more than 3000 samples have been sieved to identify the relationships between the erodible fraction of soils and the physical and chemical properties of the soil. The erodible fraction was computed from the percentage of sand, percentage of silt, sand/clay ratio, organic carbon and calcium carbonate. The computed erodible fraction using soil physical and chemical properties compared well with average measured erodible fraction from standard compact rotary sieving from sites with at least 20 samples. The erodible fraction of dryland soils was reduced an average of 14% and of irrigated soils 24% with moldboard plowing. -from Authors},

abstract={A group of specialists was asked by the Environmental Protection Agency to use their judgment as to which soil variables would be most impacted by five scenarios of climatic change in deserts of North America that could occur over the next 40 years. The following soil characteristics were evaluated in terms of their potential for change: physical, chemical, and biological crusts; the vesicular layer; soil organic matter; organic C and N content; the C/N ratio; carbonate pool; inorganic N, P, and S; salinity levels; micro-element content; microbial community composition; free- living microbial Nfixation; denitrification; ammonia volatilization; salinization rates; water infiltration; evaporation; lateral flow and leaching; wind and water erosion; and litter decomposition. The Delphi approach was used to reach consensus on expected trends. Computer modeling was used to integrate and project interactive changes. We expect physical and chemical crusting, vesicularity, ammonium volatilization, soil erosion, and salt accumulation to increase and microphytic crusts to decrease under all scenarios of climatic change. Both soil organic C and N will decline, especially under increased temperatures, whereas the C/N ratio will decline to its lowest range of possible values. Both free and symbiotic N fixation should decline unless there is a shift to greater absolute precipitation during summers. Only slight changes in soil P, S, and trace element contents are expected under any of the five scenarios of climatic change. Production of litter will change relatively little, but its chemical quality will decrease and nutrient cycling will be accelerated when the vegetation shifts from perennials to annuals. Use of the Century Model showed that soil organic matter is more sensitive to temperature changes than precipitation. Indicators of desert ecosystem “health” that we identified are relatively low albedo, patchiness of plant cover and interspace (trend depends on context), changes in drainage patterns and microrelief, biological crusting, and ratios of microbial biomass C to total organic C. Need for further research is outlined. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Ninety years after the start of the Askov long‐term fertilization experiment on sandy loam, bulk soil was taken from the 0–20 cm and 30–35 cm depths of unfertilized (UNF), animal‐manure (FYM) treated and mineral‐fertilized (NPK) plots and analysed for textural composition, carbon content, pH, CEC, particle density and plasticity limits. Undisturbed soil cores (100 cm3) from the 8–12 cm layer were brought to six different matric potentials and subjected to confined uniaxial compression, drop‐cone penetration and annulus shear tests. Water‐retention curves based on seven matric potentials were produced for undisturbed cores from the 8–12 and 30–35 cm layers. In the field, in situ shear strength of plough‐layer soil was determined by a vane shear tester and a torsional shear box. FYM and NPK treatments increased the soil organic carbon content by 23 and 11% of the amount in UNF, respectively. Corresponding increases observed in CEC were 17 and 11%. The water content at the lower and upper plastic limits both decreased from FYM to NPK to UNF. Soil bulk density in the 0‐20 cm layer was reduced in FYM and NPK treatments relative to UNF, whereas the volume of soil pores larger than 30 μm was unaffected by past fertilization. Soil receiving animal manure showed the greatest soil strength when exposed to annulus shear, drop‐cone penetration and confined uniaxial compression tests, Shear strength measurements indicated that the UNF sandy loam soil reacted like a sand, the increase in soil strength upon drying primarily being due to increased internal friction. In contrast, soil from FYM and NPK treatments showed reactions typical of a loamy soil, the increase in soil strength during drying being caused by increased cohesion in the soil matrix. The field tests employed were unable to detect the management‐induced differences in soil physical parameters found in the laboratory tests. This study shows that physical soil properties related to conditions for tillage and traffic, to crop development and erosion are significantly influenced by differences in soil organic matter levels resulting from contrasting methods of fertilizer management. Exhausting a loamy soil by long‐term lack of fertilizer application severely affects the physical properties of the soil. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Logging operations can cause soil profile disturbance and compaction. Soil profile disturbance and compaction change soil physical properties, which may reduce site productivity, increase soil erosion and degrade catchment water quality. This study was undertaken to measure the effect of logging on physical properties of the 0-100 mm surface soil in the Victorian Central Highlands, southeastern Australia. Soil physical properties were measured in the snig tracks, log landings, general logging areas (disturbed areas which were not occupied by snig tracks or log landings) and undisturbed areas. Within the general logging areas, measurements were made for three levels of soil profile disturbance: litter disturbed, topsoil disturbed and subsoil disturbed. The results indicated that logging significantly increased bulk density and decreased organic carbon and organic matter content, total porosity and macroporosity on over 72% of the coupe area. However, on 35% of the coupe area, the snig tracks, log landings and subsoil disturbed areas of the general logging area, bulk densities and macroporosities reached critical levels where tree growth could be affected. On these areas, organic carbon decreased between 27 and 66%, bulk density increased between 39 and 65% and macroporosity decreased between 58 and 88%. Saturated hydraulic conductivities decreased to critical levels for runoff to occur on over 72% of the coupe area (topsoil and subsoil disturbed areas of the general logging area, snig tracks and log landings). On this area, the reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity varied between 60 and 95%. © 1994.},

abstract={The utility of the caesium-137 (137Cs) technique, for estimating the effects of wind erosion, was evaluated on the soils of a semi-arid agricultural area near Jerramungup, Western Australia. The past incidence of wind erosion was estimated from field observations of soil profile morphology and an existing remote sensing study. Erosion was limited to sandy surfaced soils (0-4% clay), with a highly significant difference (P &lt; 0-0001) in137Cs values between eroded and non-eroded sandy soils, with mean values of 243±17 and 386±13 Bq m-2respectively. Non-eroded soils, with larger clay contents, had a mean137Cs content of 421±26 Bqm-2, however, due to considerable variation between replicate samples, this value was not significantly different from that of the non-eroded sands. Hence, although the technique discriminates between eroded and non-eroded areas, the large variation in137Cs values means that from 27 to 96 replicate samples are required to provide statistically valid estimates of137Cs loss. The occurrence of around 18% of the total137Cs between 10 and 20 cm depth in these soils, despite cultivation being confined to the surface 9 cm, suggests that leaching of137Cs occurs in the sandy soils, although there was no relationship between clay content and137Cs value for either eroded or non-eroded soils. In a multiple linear regression, organic carbon content and the mean grain size of the eroded soils explained 35% of the variation in137Cs content. This relationship suggests that both organic carbon and137Cs are removed by erosion, with erosion being more prevalent on soils with a finer sand fraction. Clay and silt contents do not vary with depth in the near-surface horizons of the eroded sandy soils, hence it is likely that wind erosion strips the entire surface horizon with its137Cs content, rather than selectively winnowing fine material. © 1994 CSIRO.

abstract={Stability of aggregates at the immediate soil surface affects the detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles. The aggregate stability (expressed as mean weight diameter, MWD) and erosion rate were tested for clayey surface soils at two different water contents. The soils consisted of six Oxisols, one Ultisol, three Vertisols, one Alfisol, and one Aridisol. The MWD was determined by wet sieving of 4.76 to 8.00 aggregates, which were either air-dried (MWDd) or capillary prewetted at −0.5 kPa for 24 h (MNDw). Air-dried and prewetted (saturated from the bottom up for 2 h) soils were subjected to a 110-mm h−1rain until a steady-state infiltration was reached. Runoff, sediment loss, and infiltration (for prewetted soil only) were monitored throughout the rain. The MWDdranged from 0.18 to 4.80 mm, and the MWDwranged from 0.44 to 5.66 mm. Prewetting increased the MWD for the oxidic or kaolinitic Oxisols and Ultisols and for one smectitc/kaolinitic Vertisol. The MWDwwas positively related to CEC for highly weathered soils and negatively related for swelling soils, whereas base saturation was negatively related for both groups of soils. The ΔMWD, which expresses the increase in stability caused primarily by a decrease in slaking, was greatest for soils rich in kaolinite and Fe and Al oxyhydroxides and low in organic carbon. The steady-state infiltration rate (Is) ranged from 1.8 (illitic soil) to 54.8 mm. h−1(sandy loam kaolinitic soil). The Iswas consistently less for swelling than for highly weathered soils, and it was related to the sand/clay ratio, sand, and water retained between −33 and −1500 kPa. The increased aggregate stability with prewetting was generally not reflected in smaller amounts of erosion and runoff, possibly because of the faster rate of wetting than for the stability test, a higher water table for the prewetted soil than for the air-dried soil, and the inclusion of smaller aggregates in the erosion tests. Prewetting decreased the time to ponding for three highly weathered Oxisols and the illitic Alfisol, increased steady-state runoff rate (Qw) for five highly weathered soils, increased sediment loss rate (Qs) for the illitic and for one highly weathered soil, and increased Qson a stable Oxisol. Soil textural properties (usually clay and sand/clay) and “binding” agents (organic carbon and Fe and Al oxyhydroxides) were the significant independent variables included in the stepwise multiple linear regressions for Is Qs and Qw © 1994 Williams &amp; Wilkins.},

abstract={Adoption of reduced or no-tillage practices on a large scale depends on the maintenance of a favorable soil environment for crop growth in addition to providing a sustained protection against soil erosion. We evaluated the changes in soil aggregation status (0-5 cm) and in other physical and chemical properties (0-15 cm) of a Malmo clay loam (Typic Cryoboroll, Black Chernozemic) subjected to three tillage and residue management systems after nine years in central Alberta with a subhumid temperate climate. The soil was cropped to spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) each year. The treatments included: no tillage, straw retained on the surface; tillage, straw incorporated into surface soil; and tillage, straw removed. Tillage consisted of two rotocultivations to a depth of 10 cm, one in late fall and another in spring before seeding. In the no till+straw treatment, the crop was directly seeded with a hoe drill. The no till+straw treatment provided 70 to 99% residue cover, followed by till+straw (41 to 85%) and till+no straw (6 to 14%). Tillage significantly increased the soil surface roughness, while seasonal rainfall greatly reduced it. Although the no till+straw treatment had a smaller surface roughness, it would provide more effective and sustained runoff and erosion control owing to its greater residue cover and a greater amount of larger water-stable aggregates. This treatment had significantly greater organic carbon content, lower pH, lower particle density and greater electrical conductivity in the 0-5 cm soil depth interval compared with the tilled treatments. The differences among treatments became less pronounced with depth. For the surface soil of the no till+straw treatment, the proportion of wind erodible (< 1 mm) and water-slakable micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm) was also smaller, and mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter greater compared to the tilled treatments. Soil structural stability increased due to straw addition and a better aggregate size distribution occurred due to a reduction in soil disturbance. © 1994.},

abstract={This paper presents an attempt to integrate methods of landscape regionalization and already established model approaches which describe the soil water budget, the dynamics of soluble and adsorbed substances as well as the different processes of the soil nitrogen budget. This integration leads to the Catchment Related Water &amp; Substance Simulation System (CWSS), which gives the ability to carry out simulations for the area of small catchments. CWSS is a modular process-based system that simulates the soil water and ground water dynamics, surface runoff, soil heat budget and organic carbon and nitrogen transformation processes. It gives the ability to calculate water and substance budgets for a number of landscape cells, determined by the heterogeneity of soil conditions, elevation and landuse. Water and substance inputs into creeks, rivers and lakes concerning to the catchment area can be simulated with a high temporal resolution. There are many scientific and management applications, for which this system could be used. For example it could help address ecological issues like eutrophication, effects of global warming, water management and soil erosion. Methods of parameter estimation and procedures concerning the regional aspects of soil variability, elevation and landuse conditions are described. The combination with a geographical information system (GIS) and the deduction of input values from various data sets, which are available all over the country, are described. Some simulation results related to the catchment of Lake Belau (north Germany) will be discussed. In this area nitrate concentrations of ground water exceed the legal limit for drinking water (50 mg NO3/l) and a high degree of eutrophication characterizes the lake. © 1994.},

abstract={Legume groundcovers have been promoted for controlling soil erosion in hillside banana plantations in northern New South Wales. An experiment was conducted at Alstonville to determine the effect of an Arachis pintoi (Pinto peanut) groundcover on banana productivity. The Arachis groundcover was slow to establish in the first year, but thereafter grew vigorously. While standing dry matter of groundcover was reduced at closer banana plant spacings, it was always more than adequate to control erosion. After 5.5 years many soil chemical parameters had been significantly affected by the presence of groundcover. Organic carbon concentrations to 30 cm depth were 5.6% greater on the groundcover plots (3.94 v. 3.71%), and total nitrogen was 8.5% greater (0.42 v. 0.39%). Other increases were exchangeable potassium 52%, calcium 26%, magnesium 43%, sodium 23%, electrical conductivity 24%, and pH 0.13 units. Banana leaf nutrient concentrations were not affected. Banana plants with groundcover produced 9% fewer bunches than their bare soil counterparts, with 4% fewer fingers per bunch. By the end of the experiment, fingers on the groundcover treatment were 9% lighter; consequently, the weight of marketable fruit (i.e. >120 g/finger) per bunch was reduced by 31% in the final year. The presence of groundcover reduced total fruit production over the whole trial by 16% and marketable fruit by 19%. In the last year of the experiment, total fruit production was reduced by 25%, and marketable fruit production by 40%. Over the whole trial, banana plants with groundcover produced 22% fewer suckers than the bare soil controls, with most of the effect occurring in the first 2 years. Soil temperatures at 20 cm under groundcover were as much as 0.7±C cooler than the controls in October-January, but similar for the rest of the year. This effect possibly contributed to decreased yields. Although the experiment was irrigated, the irrigation was possibly inadequate for the groundcover treatment, and competition for water between the Arachis and banana plants may also have been responsible for part of the yield depression.

abstract={Hillslope deposits in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa are incised by gullies (dongas) which expose sequences of buried palaeosols developed within a succession of discontinuity-bounded colluvial sedimentary units. Infilled and buried palaeogully topography attests to at least four geomorphic cycles, comprising gully cut-and-fill and palaeosol formation, on hillslopes in the region during the past 135 ka. Past attempts at dating colluvial stratigraphic units were limited to radiocarbon dating of associated palaeosol organic matter and authigenic soil carbonates. This study presents a preliminary set of Infra Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) age determinations pertaining to deposition of the succession of colluvial units infilling and burying palaeogullies at several sites of stratigraphic, geochronological and palaeoenvironmental importance in the region. Interpretation of the IRSL and 14C dates in the context of cyclical hillslope processes suggests that past episodes of palaeogully erosion and infill were not synchronous and individual palaeosol landsurfaces were diachronous during the late Pleistocene. © 1994.},

Global typology of the C export rates (g.m-2.yr-1) for 14 river classes from tundra rivers to monsoon rivers is used to calculate global TAC flux to oceans estimated to 542 Tg.yr-1, of which 37 % is as DOC, 18 % as soil POC and 45 % as DIC. TAC originates mostly from humid tropics (46 %) and temperate forest and grassland (31 %), compared to boreal forest (14 %), savannah and sub-arid regions (5 %), and tundra (4 %). Rivers also carry to oceans 80 Tg. yr-1 of POC and 137 TG.yr-1 of DIC originating from rock erosion. Permanent TAC storage on land is estimated to 52 Tg.yr-1 in lakes and 17 Tg.yr-1 in internal regions of the continents. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={In loamy Hapludalfs and sandy Haplorthods under forest and cultivation, the annual C, Al and Fe balances are presented in order to indicate element transfer into the subsoil. Aluminium and iron in the soil solution are separated into inorganic and organic fractions. In the Typic Hapludalf under forest initial podzolization is documented by an increase in Al release, its translocation into the subsoil and soil acidification. The Al3+ concentration is 2.7 mg l-1 and probably phytotoxic. The Hapludalfs under cultivation are influenced by stagnant water and the main part of iron is translocated in iron-organic complexes from the Bt into the subsoil. The aluminium release and transfer is minimal. In one Hapludalf erosion hinders an accumulation of humus, in spite of a C surplus. Extensive soil management in the forest and intensive cultivation without application of manure are incompatible with soil protection. In a Typic Haplorthod under spruce, podzolization is documented by the translocation of carbon and especially aluminium. A low pH induces weathering of soil minerals with a high release of Al3+ and its translocation into the subsoil. Its concentration in the topsoil is extremely phytotoxic. In a similar Typic Haplorthod under cultivation the carbon and metal sink (Bh/Bhs) is being decomposed and has become a source of carbon and iron-organic complexes; these are translocated into the subsoil. The natural accumulation process has been reversed by man. © 1993.},

abstract={The Chernobyl nuclear accident took place on 1986-04-26, and resulted in radionuclide pollution of vast regions of Byelorussia. This has raised several geochemical problems: (1) investigation of the distribution and behaviour of radionuclides in the natural and technogenic landscapes (which were examined as a result of a 5-a study); (2) modes of occurence of radioactive elements in the environment; and (3) preliminary estimation of radionuclide migration in the future. As background information, geochemical studies carried out within Byelorussia, as well as landscape investigations in the period 1953-1987 made under the guidance of K.I. Lukashev were very important for solving the above questions. According to the results of these investigations, the lithogeochemical and hydrogeochemical zoning of Byelorussia is understood and the radioactive background of the republic was studied in the 1960s, as well as the distribution and peculiarities of clay minerals, carbonates, Fe. Mn oxides, organic matter, pH-Eh, and the contents of many elements in the surficial deposits of Byelorussia. All these factors are of great importance for understanding the behaviour of radionuclides.Radionuclide fallout on Byelorussia in the first days after the accident was mainly dependent on the mass movement of air and rain. In cities, fallout was confined to regions with intensive industrial dust emissions, as well as to river valleys, where degassing of deep-seated zones through faults occurred side by side with evaporation. Radionuclide washout from upland territories can be related to secondary processes.After 5 a, the radioactive emission near the surface of the Earth decreased due to the decay of short-lived isotopes and penetration of radionuclides deeper into the soil, although the major part still occurs at a depth of 1-5 cm. Bogs, peat-bog soils, aquifers with fluctuating groundwater levels, variable pH-Eh conditions and a igh biological activity are all factors contributing to radionuclide migration in the Byelorussian landscape. A part of the radionuclides is gradually removed from eluvial landscape and accumulated in subareal landscape (e.g. lakes, oxbow-lakes, water-storage basins).The Chernobyl debris are represented by the following substances: "hot" particles, pseudocolloids, aerosols and gaseous compounds. Study of the modes of occurrence of radionuclides by different methods (e.g. extracts, sorbents) made it possible to estimate the migration capacity of some radionuclides (Cs, Sr, Ce, Ru), and to distinguish two zones around the reactor-the nearest and remote ones-differing in the ratio of "hot" particles and condensate fallout, which causes a different migration capcity of radionuclides.A very important part is assigned to biological processes and organic matter, which cause the destruction of "hot" paricles, the formation of organomethallic complexes, and water migration of nuclides.In the future (within 300 and more years), the redistribution of radionuclides in the landscape involves processes of weathering, erosion and sedimentation which will strongly depend on climatic conditions, Side by side with a gradual decay of Cs and Sr, an appreciable accumulation of241Am, which is very mobile in landscape, should be expected due to decaying241Pu.A considerable development of scientific and applied exploration should also be expected in the future and this will help in solving problems of radioactive pollution of landscapes. © 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.},

abstract={To analyze the changes induced by cultivation such as soil erosion and soil organic matter depletion, we examined Andisols in Japan, by comparing the morphological characteristics and organic matter contents of seven cultivated soils (cultivation for 270 y) with those of four uncultivated soils (vegetation consisting of deciduous broad-leaved trees) on the Musashino plateau. The 2Bw or 3Bw horizons corresponding to the upper part of the Tachikawa loam layer No. 2 (Tc. 2) with red and black scoriae in close contact, were observed at 90–97 cm and 45–72 cm depths from the soil surface, respectively in the uncultivated and cultivated sites. The differences in the soil thickness from the surface to the top of Tc. 2 between the uncultivated and cultivated soils suggested that the soils were eroded as a result of cultivation for crop production. The A horizon thickness was 52–80 cm in the uncultivated soils, and 22–52 cm in the cultivated soils. As a result of the decrease of the A horizon thickness due to cultivation, the area based contents of organic matter in the most of the cultivated soils were markedly lower than those of the uncultivated soils. However, in one cultivated soil, the area based contents of organic matter did not decrease, and the changes in the area based content of organic matter induced by cultivation exhibited a wide range among cultivated soils. There were no statistical differences in soil color, bulk density, and concentrations of organic carbon and total nitrogen between the uncultivated A2 and cultivated Ap horizons. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role in maintaining tropical soil fertility. Its conservation and maintenance in tropical cultivation systems is imperative if soil degradation is to be halted and cropping made sustainable. Around 22-23% of global carbon is present in tropical ecosystems but only 2-3% of this is present in the soil. Fluxes of CO2 to the atmosphere from tropical soils after deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect and could represent a 1-4% increase in the overall steady-state annual CO2 release to the atmosphere. The composition of SOM is extremely diverse, with active, or labile, fractions decomposing in a matter of months while the more resistant, or nonlabile, fractions remain in soil for many years. SOM plays a central role in providing good soil structure, in supplying nutrients and in providing ion exchange capacity in tropical soils. Organic matter decomposition rates in tropical soils are generally faster than in temperate soils because decay of the nonlabile fraction is generally faster. Changes in tropical land use have profound effects on SOM status. Tropical deforestation causes significant losses of soil carbon and nitrogen which tend to decline further under continuous cultivation. Reasons for declines in soil fertility include accelerated soil erosion, loss of litter influx after canopy removal and enhanced decomposition and nutrient mineralization rates after forest clearance. A wide range of soil management techniques have been designed to conserve and improve SOM stocks in tropical cultivation systems. These include agroforestry techniques, intercropping with legumes and the use of mulches and other organic inputs. While many of these techniques look promising in terms of improved crop yields, there is urgent need for research on how these practices alter the physical, chemical and biological processes and conditions of tropical soils. © 1993, Sage Publications.

abstract={Identification and mapping of areas affected by various soil degradation processes in medium textured alluvial plain of arid region of India was performed. Impact of degradation on physicochemical properties of soils was evaluated. Soil degradation processes were identified by using Landsat TM FCC subscene and ground truth verification. The kind, extent, and severity of degradations were mapped. Soil stripping, sheet wash, gully erosion, and natural or man-induced salinization were the major soil degradation processes. In an area of over 3563 km2, 52% of the area was degraded due to soil stripping, sheet wash, and gully erosion, and 8% due to salinity. Degradation due to combined water erosion and salinization covered 33% of the total area. Nearly 30% of the area needs urgent attention to arrest the process of soil degradation. Soil degradation processes have resulted in the loss of organic carbon, available phosphorus, and available potassium. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 1993 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={The effect of maintaining veld in three conditions, viz. poor, moderate and good, for 15 years, on the organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) content (as measures of organic matter content) of a fine sandy loam soil was investigated. Composite soil samples were collected and analysed to a depth of 300 mm at 50-mm depth intervals from plots with the imposed veld conditions. The organic C and total N content of the soil under the three veld conditions differed significantly (P<0.05). Both variables declined as the veld condition degraded. Total N differed less than organic C. The largest differences were measured in the 0-50 mm layer and the smallest in the 250-300 mm layer. Losses of soil organic matter can be attributed to reduced phytomass production, increased soil erosion and change in soil climate. It is suggested that the loss of soil organic matter from degraded veld may inhibit veld recovery. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Soils under intensive cultivation have altered due to water erosion. This study was conducted to determine whether soil organic matter (SOM) composition of the colluvial source (Ap horizons) differs from the colluvial sink (M horizons). The SOM of a sandy Catena with erodic Cambisols and colluvic soils (Colluvisols) in Schleswig‐Holstein, Northwest Germany, was investigated. A wet chemical analysis was combined with CPMAS 13C‐NMR spectroscopy. In one case a significant correlation between the SOM composition of the Ap horizon of the erodic Cambisol and the M horizon of the Colluvisol was high (r2 = 0.904‐), whereas the correlation for the other set was much weaker (r2 = 0.640*). Two possible paths of pedogenesis are discussed. About 70% of the SOM of the colluvial source is decomposed during translocation or after deposition. A selective preservation or new formation of humins in the M material is probable. These humins contain, obviously, large amounts of polysaccharides, which were not detected by the wet chemical analysis. Further investigations of colluvic and erodic soils are necessary in order to specify the SOM quality and its possible modification due to soil translocation and accumulation.

abstract={The 1987 National Resources Inventory was used to provide a random sample of 100 Illinois cropland sites growing corn and soybeans. These were used with the erosion productivity impact calculator model to simulate responses of soil erosion and nutrient exports to several different tillage and crop rotation practices. However, no-till significantly reduced soil erosion rates and loss of soil organic carbon compared to conventional tillage. This generally led to reduced losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in eroded soil. Percolation below the root zone represented the greatest N export and is of concern for the issue of groundwater contamination. The model predictions for different management practices were in line with measured changes in site-specific field studies under similar conditions. -from Authors},

abstract={A seven-year tillage trial was conducted in central New South Wales, Australia to measure the effect and extent of conservation tillage practices on soil physical and chemical properties. Three tillage treatments, traditional tillage (TT), reduced tillage (RT) and direct drilling (DD) were imposed on hardsetting red-brown earths at Cowra and Grenfell. A fourth treatment, direct drilling without grazing (NT) was imposed at Cowra only. At Cowra there was a significant trend of reduced total runoff in the DD and NT treatments but not in the RT treatment. Runoff significantly increased in the TT treatment. At Grenfell, runoff decreased in all treatments but only significantly in the DD and RT treatments. Similar trends in total sediment loss were measured at both sites. Associated physical measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity, sorptivity and bulk density confirmed that the changes in runoff were due to the creation of macroporosity greater than 0.75 mm diameter. The relationship between macroporosity, organic carbon and aggregate stability is discussed. Conclusions were that in these soil types runoff and sediment loss were affected more by destruction of macroporosity due to cultivation than changes in organic carbon from residue retention. To achieve these soil improvements using conservation tillage a continuous cropping period of four years was necessary to obtain significant and consistent trends. Soil chemical data showed that total nitrogen increased with conservation tillage practices. Available phosphorus changes due to tillage were not observed because of more than adequate fertiliser applied. Soil pH decreased significantly in the DD and NT treatments at Cowra only. The implications of these chemical changes are discussed. © 1993.},

abstract={Tillage systems that address soil conservation and sustainable crop yield need to be developed. Research was conducted on a Walla Walla silt loam (Typic Haploxeroll) to determine the long-term (19 years) effect of four tillage systems on soil properties and crop yield in a green pea (Pisum sativum L.)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation that was started in 1968. The experimental design was a split plot with four replications. Wheat and peas were grown each season. The primary tillage systems were: (T1) fall moldboard plow after wheat and after peas (control); (T2) fall rototill after wheat and fall sweep after peas; (T3) spring moldboard plow after wheat and fall moldboard plow after peas; (T4) no tillage after wheat and fall sweep after peas. Soil measurements included bulk density, pH, organic carbon, penetration resistance, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Profiles of bulk density, penetration resistance and pH revealed unique differences among treatments. However, there were no consistent differences in yield among the four tillage systems, in either green peas or wheat. From a crop production viewpoint, changes in soil properties on these tillage plots were inconsequential. From a soil erosion viewpoint, spring plowing (T3) and conservation tillage (T4) have an advantage over T2 and T1 because surface cover is maintained during the first winter following wheat harvest. Results show the importance of testing tillage systems over long periods of time and that the traditional system of fall moldboard plowing after wheat and after peas can be replaced by conservation systems without yield loss. © 1993.},

abstract={A deposit of post-glacial organo-calcareous silt 25-40 m thick blankets the floor of Suva Harbour and its marginal inlets, including Draunibota Bay, on the southeast coast of Viti Levu, Fiji. This deposit is notable for its involvement in a large number of foundation failures in the area. The organo-calcareous silt is the latest sedimentary infill over a late Pleistocene erosional surface which is dissected characteristically down to around 50 m below current mean sea level at the harbour margins, and to at least 90 m at the seaward end of the study area. The gross distribution of Pleistocene and Holocene sedimentary units is strongly influenced by Pliocene graben formation in the Mio-Pliocene bedrock. The silt deposit forms part of a transgressive and highstand systems tract related to the latest glacio-eustatic sea-level rise, and includes a series of lobate delta deposits currently prograding at the mouths of streams entering the harbour. The silt was deposited in a lagoonal/estuarine environment of restricted circulation in a marginal/back-barrier reef situation and received a variety of marine carbonate and terrigenous sediment contributions, as well as organic substances from both autochthonous and allochthonous sources. Undisturbed sampling indicates the silt to be homogeneous, non-layered and thoroughly bioturbated, but a distinct layering with a spacing in the order of 1-5 m, probably related to periodic influxes of terrigenous material, is obvious on continuous seismic profiles. Acoustic turbidity due to biogenic gas in thick accumulations over palaeo-channels may well represent zones of high pore fluid pressure, and indicate lower effective soil strength. There is also evidence that the passage of the overpressured gas front results in hydraulic fracturing and consequent degassing of the silt. The silt deposit displays a slight upward coarsening in response to shoaling conditions, accompanied by an upward increase in both organic carbon and calcium carbonate proportions, and a decreasing terrigenous contribution. The increase in organic carbon is closely mirrored by increased diagenetic development of bacterially-deposited agglomerates of iron sulfide crystals in the pore spaces. The resulting pore-space microstructure appears to exert a direct control on the in-situ void ratio, and hence directly affects the consolidation and strength characteristics of the sediment. Radiocarbon dates from the silt deposit indicate a consistent rate of deposition in the Draunibota palaeo-channel of 4.3 m/1000 yr since the marine transgressive front passed the site some 9600 yr B.P. The dates extend the reliable local sea-level data for southeast Viti Levu back some further 4000 years, and support an earlier contention that sea level reached its current position here at around 4000-4500 yr B.P., about 2000 years later than on the coast of southeast Australia. Water depth at the Cement Works Bridge site reached a maximum of 20 m some 5000 yr B.P. and, subsequently, has gradually shoaled to its present position just below mean sea level. © 1993.},

abstract={The Holocene record of Lake Lugano (southern basin: surface area 20.3 km2, maximum depth 87 m) comprising organic carbon-rich sediments (sapropels), is divided into eight intervals based on radiocarbon- and varve-dating. The content of organic carbon, inorganic carbon, and biogenic silica, as well as the benthic remains of ostracods and oligochaetes, are converted into accumulation rates and benthic abundances in order to assess past production rates and bottom water oxygen status, respectively. The results suggest three periods of distinct palaeolimnological character: (i) low primary production combined with shifts between aerobic and anaerobic profundal conditions (prior to ca. 3000 BC), (ii) moderate rates of production combined with a relatively high profundal oxygen content (after ca. 1500 BC), and (iii), high production rates (460 g C m-2 a-1) combined with anaerobic profundal conditions (present eutrophic state). Corresponding organic carbon contents in the sediments are: up to 5% (i), 4% (ii), and 8% (iii). Until the beginning of this century, the flux of autochthonous sediments to the lake floor correlated with the fluctuations in the allochthonous sediment accumulation rate, indicating that catchment erosion largely controlled lacustrine production during the Holocene history of Lake Lugano. Pollen data show catchment-vegetational transformations at ca. 3500 BC (change from fir to beech forests), at 1400 BC (onset of cereal vegetation) and at ca. A.D. 450 (strong increase in various cultural plants). The first two changes had a relatively large imprint on lacustrine sedimentation. At ca. 3500 BP, erosion increase in the catchment was triggered by vegetation changes in the mountain zone above ca. 1000 m a. s. l., which may have been induced by climatic and human alteration (drop in the treeline altitude). Maximum catchment erosion occurred at ca. 1400 BC which was clearly dominated by human cultivation during the Bronze Age. More oxygenated profundal conditions in the lake after ca. 3000 BC are possibly related to a better mixing of the lake waters during the winter season by increased wind activity. © 1992 Birkhäuser Verlag.},

abstract={The status of environmental conditions for forests, soils, water, air, and atmospheric changes is presented for developing countries. Loss and degradation of forests continue. The rate of cutting of moist tropical forests is 17-20 million hectares/year. The consequences would be eventual total destruction within several generations, lost soil and watershed protection, local climate change, and habitat destruction. The human toll can also be great as seen by the flooding deaths of 5000 Philippine villagers. Soil erosion is a greater danger than desertification. In sub-Saharan Africa, total harvest and yields of important food crops have declined compared to increases elsewhere in the world. In countries such as Costa Rica, Malawi, Mali, and Mexico the soil losses approximate .5-1.5% of gross domestic product annually. Progress has been made in water purification, but there are still nearly 1 million people in the developing world without access to clean water for drinking and bathing. 1.7 billion have inadequate sanitation. Access to sanitation in urban areas is on the rise. Waterborne diseases are a result of poor sanitation: 900 million cases of diarrheal disease/year, 500 million with trachoma, 200 million with schistosomiasis, or bilharzia, and 900 million from hookworm. Other diseases resulting from improper sanitation are cholera, typhoid, and paratyphoid. Water scarcity is another problem. Air quality is threatened by dust and smoke pollution which contribute to respiratory illnesses, by indoor burning of wood and charcoal particularly in rural Africa and south Asia, and high levels of lead from automobile emissions. Hundreds of thousands of people are affected through increased illness and even loss of mental functioning as in the case of lead poisoning. Atmospheric changes such as ozone depletion or global warming may not show their impact until decades later. The consequences are high levels of ultraviolet radiation which cause cancers, cataracts, and possibly immune system damage, and temperature increases which will increase the levels of the seas.},

abstract={It is now well accepted that riparian forests have an important role in regulating upstream/downstream flow of matter and energy in river ecosystems. Since geomorphic processes determine the structure of channels and floodplains, we have investigated whether different geomorphic features of riparian forests had any effects on the ability of their soils to retain nutrients and organic carbon. Willow riparian forests were chosen within the annual floodplain of the Garonne River, southwest France, to represent two different geomorphic types. Erosional types of riparian forests (E-type) were characterized by sand deposition on their soils because of high current velocity which hampered fine particle deposition. Depositional types of riparian forests (D-type) were characterized by slower overflow velocity; consequently silt and clay were dominant in their soils. Soil samples were taken at the end of the vegetation growth period, coinciding with low water levels prior to annual floods. Erosion and sedimentation processes affected the distribution of total C,N, and P contents in riparian forest soils, since they were significantly correlated with soil grain size. D-type riparian forest soils act as a sink for upstream/downstream nutrients and carbon flows during floods through accumulation of total C,N and P from year to year. In contrast, E-type riparian forests act as potential nutrient sources during high water periods, since they may release from their soils large amounts of easily available C, N and P into the river. These results demonstrate that nutrients and carbon retention ability of riparian forests soils should be analyzed through their geomorphic features rather than by their vegetation composition. Even if they belong to the same vegetation succession, riparian forests should not be considered as a homogeneous buffering system for upstream/downstream flows of nutrients and organic carbon. © 1992 SPB Academic Publishing bv.},

abstract={Cs-137 redistribution data have been used to estimate the extent and the pattern of long-term soil erosion in the Quebec City area. Mean annual net soil movements ranging from a deposition of 10.8 t ha-1yr-1 to a loss of 31.8 t ha-1yr-1 were estimated. The slope steepness and the land use significantly influenced the estimated rates of soil movement, while soil texture was less important, probably because of the soils' sandy texture or the high content of organic carbon, which kept their erodibility low. The net soil losses estimated from Cs-137 data were consistently higher than those predicted by the USLE. Besides net soil losses, it was possible to estimate separately the magnitude of soil detachment and soil deposition. -from Authors},

abstract={The objective of this study was to measure the effect of management-induced changes in soil organic carbon (OC) concentration on soil characteristics affecting the available water capacity. Four sites each of moderately coarse (sandy), medium, and moderately fine or fine (fine) soils were sampled within each of two cropland management systems and each of two virgin grassland management systems. Bulk density decreased with increasing OC concentration, and was greatest in sandy and least in the medium-textured soils. For all soils combined, a change in sand fraction accounted for about 75% of the change in water concentration by weight. An increase in OC concentration did not change the available water capacity in the sandy group and decreased it in the medium and fine textural groups. Loss of soil productivity induced by erosion in the northern Great Plains is probably not associated with a change in available water capacity. -from Authors},

abstract={Abundance and distribution of earthworms were studied on the Georgia Piedmont of the Southeastern U.S.A., at sites representing various ecosystem types, management practices, landscape positions, soil textures and soil erosion status. Earthworm abundance showed distinct seasonal patterns, with winter/spring maxima and summer minima. Numbers and biomass ranged from zero in plowed. mono-cropped soil at an upland site to over 1000 m-2 ( &gt; 25g ash-free dry wt m-2) in no-tillage, double-cropped soil on bottomlands. Numbers and biomass in plowed, double-cropped soil, in a bottomland forest, and in grass meadows at both upland and bottomland sites were intermediate. Soil texture, as influenced by water erosion, strongly affected earthworm abundance. Moderately and severely eroded sandy clay loam supported significantly higher earthworm numbers and biomass than did slightly eroded soil with higher sand content. This effect may have resulted from low organic content and water holding capacity of the sandy soils. Of the soil texture variables, silt content was most highly correlated with earthworm biomass. Earthworm abundance was also related to quantity and quality of plant residue inputs in the agroecosystems, and to standing stocks of soil organic carbon across all sites studied. At most agroecosystem and forest sites, the predominant earthworm species were European lumbricids; native Diplocardia spp were most prominent in a meadow soil with high organic content. © 1992.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative methods of estimating the postsettlement soil erosion from hillslopes in a small watershed in Bureau County, northwestern Illinois. Methods used include: (i) estimation of the soil erosion using total organic C balance or enrichment ratio, (ii) selected soil property comparisons between the cultivated, sloping, and eroded soils of the watershed and uncultivated, sloping, and uneroded reference soils of the same taxa occurring in the area cemeteries, and (iii) Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). Previously measured sediment remaining in the sediment basin and calculated sediment delivery were used as the bases for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed methods to estimate soil erosion from the surrounding hill-slopes. Differences in thickness of the A horizon consistently underestimated soil erosion by 64% relative to the estimates made by the total sediment remaining in basin and delivered to the stream. This suggests erosion classes which are based on erosion of topsoil underestimate the extent of erosion from both the topsoil and subsoil, particularly where soils have been severely truncated. Organic C redistribution was highly correlated to sediment delivery method and appear to be related directly to the quantity of soil eroded and could provide an alternative to A horizon thickness differences as a basis for quantifying soil erosion. The soil erosion estimated by the USLE was 80% of the soil erosion estimated by the sediment delivery method. This difference can be accounted for by the fact that the sediment delivery method assumed all the sediment came from the sideslopes and USLE is not designed to include erosion resulting from concentrated overland flow (gully erosion). The comparison between cultivated and uncultivated sites of the depth to carbonates and the lowest part of the Bt horizon containing 27% clay between eroded and uneroded phases of Tama soils each produced an estimate of soil erosion within 17% of the soil erosion estimated by sediment delivery method and could be used to estimate soil erosion. © 1992 The Williams and Wilkins.},

abstract={Eroded Kandhapludult soils occupy more than 40% of the Southern Piedmont region of the USA. The humid-thermic climate associated with the Ultisols permits double crop residue production ranging from 10 to 14 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Long-term conservation tillage into these crop residues is beneficial in ameliorating the effects of soil erosion. During the course of a five-year study, decomposition of these residues increased soil carbon significantly. Restoration processes were initiated by increasing average soil carbon, representing slight, moderate and severe soil erosion classes, from 0.97 to 2.37% in the 0 to 1.5-cm depth. Accompanying soil carbon responses were increases in soil N, water-stable aggregation and infiltration. Runoff coefficients on conservation tilled restored soils was only 6%, compared to 35% for those conventionally tilled. Rill and interrill soil loss rates were also reduced significantly with surface residue provided with conservation tillage. Restoring Ultisol landscapes with variable levels of soil erosion requires differential fertilization. All fertilizer requirements for severely eroded plots were 1.43 to 2.30-fold higher than those of moderately eroded plots. Because biological N fixation by the crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) cover crop appeared to be retarded on the severely eroded site, observed plant N stress developed on the irrigated/conservation tillage treatment. Cumulative grain yields of severely eroded site, ranged from 15.4 to 30.3 Mg ha-1 5yr-1, and were statistically equal to or exceeded those of the slightly eroded site. Conservation tillage grain yields were best optimized on the rainfed-moderately eroded site, probably because of the more desirable texture-organic properties of the 13-cm thick Ap horizon. Management of cool-season cover crops with conservation tillage appears essential to restore and sustain crop productivity on eroded Ultisols. © 1992.},

abstract={Changes in soil physico-chemical properties as a result of continuous cereal cropping for up to 64 years of two southern Queensland Vertisols were investigated. The soils were the Waco black earth and the Langlands grey clay. For both soils, cultivation increased bulk densities relative to those of respective virgin soils, but soil density varied little among cultivated sites. The size and strength of dry seedbed aggregates decreased owing to cultivation, but remained suitable for wheat establishement. The stability of wet aggregates decreased with cultivation as indicated by dispersion and slaking measurements. The increased dispersion was associated with decreases in hydraulic conductivity which may limit infiltration and storage of soil water during the summer fallow, thereby reducing crop yields. Organic carbon contents decreased with cultivation while exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and pH values increased. Increased dispersibility was correlated with increased sodicity, although ESP values remained below accepted critical values. The relationship was strongest when both dispersibility and exchangeable sodium were expressed on an oven-dry soil basis rather than as the relative parameters, dispersion ratio and ESP. Organic carbon content accounted for less than 40% of the temporal variation in aggregate stability. The changes in physical and chemical properties with cultivation were consistent with exposure of subsurface material following soil erosion at rates typical for the region. We concluded that erosion control would limit further changes in levels of exchangeable sodium and thus soil dispersibility and hydraulic conductivities. The rate of loss of organic carbon would also be reduced and soil physical properties and chemical fertility would be maintained. © 1992.},

abstract={Fossil soils, especially the red soils, (linked with interstadial conditions) in the terraces of Mediterranean rivers can be important chronoclimatostratigraphic markers. The lack of organic remains makes them generally unsuitable for palaeobiological studies, and thus palaeomorphological dating has been the main method applied to determine their relative age. We present the first results of TL dating of fossil soils and water-lain sediments from the catchment area of the Turia, Júcar and Serpis Rivers in the region of Valencia (Spain). The regeneration method was used to determine the palaeodoses in fine silt grains extracted from the bulk samples and Nal(Tl) gamma-spectrometry was used for determination of the dose-rates. A blind test on a radiocarbon dated 20 ka old sample from the Po Plain (Italy) and TL ages for the Eemian palaeolithic site in Cova Negra (Valencia, Spain) indicate that the method can give correct results within the whole of the Last Glacial/Interglacial period. The specific sedimentation regime interspersed with strong erosional processes in Mediterranean valleys (coarse-grain and stony sediments, frequent erosional contacts) are not very favourable for TL dating or interpretation of the results. Also post-sedimentation changes (e.g. carbonate leaching and accumulation inside the dated horizon) could affect the dose-rate and consequently the TL age. © 1991.},

abstract={Data collected by the National Soil Survey Laboratory in support of the Water Erosion Prediction Project were used to identify soil properties that were significantly correlated with water-dispersible clay and to develop equations to estimate the water-dispersible clay content of soils based on those properties. The property most strongly correlated with water-dispersible clay is total clay. Other properties significantly correlated with water-dispersible clay are the water content at 1.5 MPa, dithionite-citrate-extractable Fe and Al, the very-fine-sand content, and the ratio of cation-exchange capacity (CEC) to total clay. A simple linear regresssion of water-dispersible clay vs. total clay revealed that approximately one-third of the total clay was water dispersible. Sorting the data by the ratio of organic carbon CEC to total clay improved the overall fit of the model and increased the regression coefficient. -from Authors},

abstract={Sediment redistribution within near‐level agricultural fields in the Gray Wooded soil zone of Saskatchewan was studied using the artificial environmental tracer caesium‐137 (137Cs). the objective of this study was to estimate erosion rates caused by wind erosion, and land clearing techniques (i.e. bulldozing). Net rates of erosion and deposition were quantified over the past 30 years on three fields. Wind erosion was estimated to be approximately 1.0 t ha−1 y−1 on a near‐level field, with 50 per cent of the sampling sites having erosion rates in excess of soil formation. Bulldozing produced median net sediment flux values of between 40 and 90 t ha−1 y−1. in addition, between 65 and 85 per cent of the sampling sites had erosion rates in excess of the maximum tolerable limit (i.e. 11.0 t ha−1 y−1). These results indicate significant accelerated erosion results from land clearing techniques used in central Saskatchewan. Bulldozing of the fields removed the LFH‐horizon and exposed the underlying mineral horizon. Bulk densitites of the 0 to 15 cm layer in the cleared fields were 27 to 55 per cent greater than the comparable depth increment within the undisturbed forest site. Organic carbon concentrations within the 1930s, 1979, and 1987 fields were decreased by 47, 42, and 37 per cent, respectively following cultivation and bulldozing. Decreases in total nitrogen for the cultivated fields ranged from 33 to 38 per cent. Copyright © 1992 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Lateral migration of Amazonian lowland rivers causes a vegetation succession on recently deposited fluvial sediments. The forest ground is formed gradually in sequence, giving rise to age-zonation of the successional stages. Sequential successional forests appear extensively along meandering white-water rivers, which are rich in suspended sediments and are characterized by mobile channels. Vegetation zonation is less pronounced at the margins of slowly eroding, suspension-poor rivers. Concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen increase toward the meander neck along with the acid reaction of the soil. The rate of riverine forest regeneration in Peruvian lowland Amazonia was extrapolated on the basis of erosion data from four different rivers, and suggests that c130km2 of forest is annually eroded and replaced by successional vegetation, the equivalent of 0.2% of the present floodplain area of this region. -from Authors},

abstract={The composition, magnetic characteristics, and pollen content of sediments from two small kettle lakes near the prairie-forest border in west-central Minnesota were used to infer changes in terrestrial vegetation, shoreline erosion, eolian inputs, carbonate deposition, and aquatic productivity. Several important changes in sediment stratigraphy coincide closely with changes in the terrestrial pollen assemblage. Accumulation rates of organic, inorganic, and carbonate sediment fractions as well as the concentration of magnetic particulates increased abruptly as prairie replaced pine forest, and decreased gradually throughout the subsequent transitions to oak scrub, and later, mixed woodland. Results suggest that by its mediation of wind exposure, local vegetation may affect (1) influx of eolian particulates, (2) erosion of shorelines, (3) water circulation, and (4) carbonate equilibria. In addition, low rates of accumulation of organic matter and increased humidicity during periods of conifer vegetation suggest that humic matter leached from forest soils may influence lake-water chemistry and reduce productivity. Changes in lake level caused by differential rates of evapotranspiration of the various vegetation types (conifer forest, deciduous hardwood forest, brush scrub, and prairie) could not be detected. Sediment-forming processes can therefore be altered by changes in local terrestrial vegetation through several mechanisms that are independent of changes in lake level. © 1992.},

abstract={This study examines the effects of traditional sedentary grazing on soils in the southern guinea savanna ecosystem in Nigeria. The characteristics of soil in grazed plots are compared with those of similar soil in ungrazed plots in a savanna 'forest' reserve in a nearby locality, in order to infer the effects of grazing. In the 0-10 cm layer of the soil, organic carbon, total nitrogen, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, cation exchange capacity and available phosphorus levels are significantly lower in the grazed plots. Decline in the organic carbon and nutrient levels of the grazed plots is mainly due to soil exposure resulting from grazing and savanna burning and the attendant processes of accelerated organic matter decomposition and nutrient loss through leaching and erosion. Low soil nutrient levels in the grazed plots will reduce primary production and hence the rate of herbage production for livestock. It could also lead to some adverse ecological changes in the ecosystem with the disappearance of certain plant species. The ecosystem consequently becomes less diverse and resilient as soil nutrient status becomes increasingly impoverished. It is suggested that herdsmen should practise rotational grazing and that livestock should be fed with a supplementary fodder of legumes, such as Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala planted in natural grazing areas, in order to minimise the problems of overgrazing which are frequently experienced during the dry season. © 1991 Science and Technology Letters.},

abstract={Aggregate stability is a measure of the ability of soil to withstand the disrupting forces of rain and nonsymmetrical wetting. Erosion may influence aggregate stability by exposing soil with properties different from the original soil surface. This study was conducted to determine: 1) the influence of antecedent soil water content on wet aggregate stability using aggregates prehumidified to near saturation; 2) the effects of organic C and clay content on the soil water content-aggregate stability relationship; and 3) the effect of topsoil removal on aggregate stability. A negative linear relationship was found between aggregate stability of prehumidified aggregates and antecedent soil water content. Prediction equations were developed that explain up to 77% of variability for the aggregate stability. Organic C was the most important of the independent variables, followed by antecedent soil water content in the multiple regression analysis. Topsoil removal by desurfacing and erosion reduced aggregate stability. Aggregate stabilities for soils with high organic C and clay content were less affected by antecedent soil water content. -from Authors},

abstract={This paper reviews current knowledge on the range and extent of various tillage systems used in North America with special reference to the effects on soil properties, the erosion hazard and water quality. The increasing adoption of conservation-tillage systems since their introduction in the early 1960s follows an enhanced awareness of the increasing risks of soil erosion and non-point source pollution and the high cost of fuel with conventional tillage. Most "conventional tillage" systems encompass complete inversion tillage along with several secondary and tertiary tillage methods. In contrast, conservation-tillage systems involve streamlining various farm operations, thereby reducing the frequency and intensity of the soil manipulative operations. Reduction in tillage intensity has been accompanied by the development of rotations and cropping systems, methods of surface and internal drainage, fertilizer technology and pest management alternatives. The status of antecedent soil physical properties is an important factor affecting the choice of tillage systems. Important soil physical properties governing the choice of tillage systems include soil wetness and anaerobiosis, soil temperature and soil structure including its susceptibility to compaction, crusting or erosion. Tillage systems affect soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Among drastic tillage-induced changes in soil properties are bulk density, infiltration rate, aggregation and aggregate size distribution, soil organic carbon and nutrient profile, microbial activity and species diversity, and the population of earthworms. Macropores and biochannels are usually more prevalent in conservation-tillage than conventional-tillage systems. Conservation tillage induces stratification of soil organic matter and related nutrients, enhances the activity of soil fauna and leads to acidification. The magnitude of these changes depends on the soil type, the cropping systems and the type of conservation tillage adopted. Soil organic carbon and nutrient stratification are generally more pronounced in coarse-textures than in clayey soils. Conservation tillage is also associated with greater biomass pool size. The latter affects the nutrient response curves of the soil. Nitrification and denitrification are other important processes affected by tillage systems. The widespread adaption of conservation-tillage systems, although beneficial in controlling off-site sedimentation, has raised concerns about the potential for increased leaching of nutrients and pesticides to groundwater. Important pollutants associated with conservation tillage are nitrate and pesticides. Some studies have shown little effect of tillage on losses of pesticides. Conservation tillage may suppress crop yields, especially on heavy textured soil with poor internal drainage and in those prone to soil compaction caused by vehicular traffic. © 1991.},

abstract={Two soils from Londrina, one in a 10-yr coffee plantation (LC), and the other in a secondary mixed hardwood forest (LM), were compared with a third Oxisol from Cascavel, also under secondary mixed hardwood forest (CA). Lime application decreased the weight percentage of 2.0 to 4.0mm-diameter aggregates and mean weight diameter of aggregates in Cascavel soil, but had no effect on the other two soils. Soil erosion, measured on the field plots with a portable rainfall simulator, was in the order LC>LM>CA, a trend that corresponded to the decreasing organic-C contents of the soils. Liming significantly decreased erosion on the LC soil, and had no effect on the other two soils. The study suggests that, while there may be some short-term structural degradation caused by liming, the long-term effect is to reduce erosion. -from Authors},

abstract={Better assessment of large scale patterns in soil fertility, erosion, and crop productivity is needed to address environmental concerns in the steeply rolling dryland farming region of eastern Washington. Spatial variability of organic carbon, soil phosphorus, and wheat yields measured on several 655 m long transects in complex eroded hills of the Palouse region of eastern Washington was studied using classical statistics and geostatistics. In addition, Landsat Thematic Mapper images of bare soil at the study site were used to estimate organic matter content in blocks having an area of 28.5m × 28.5 m. Classical statistical analysis showed moderate coefficients of variation in soil properties (25-50%) and wheat yields (30%). Spherical semivariograms of soil properties and wheat yields showed strong spatial dependence, with a range of influence on the order of from 70 m to 145 m. The semivariogram for Landsat estimated organic matter was almost identical to that for organic matter measured in the surface transects. The cross-semivariogram between measured organic matter and wheat yields also exhibited strong spatial dependence, with a range of influence of about 120m. Organic matter, soil phosphorus, and wheat yield were interpolated at unsampled locations using block kriging and block cokriging techniques. Excellent agreement was obtained between kriged wheat yields and wheat yields cokriged from Thematic Mapper estimates of organic matter. Satisfactory agreement was obtained between kriged soil phosphorus and cokriged soil phosphorus based upon remotely sensed organic matter. Results of this study provided strong evidence for nonrandom spatial patterns in soil properties and crop yields. These spatial patterns are associated with changes in surface organic matter content across the landscape resulting from extensive erosion and exposure of subsoil. Geostatistical techniques provide a powerful tool for interpolating ground measurements of soil properties and crop yield over large areas in combination with estimates of organic matter obtained from Thematic Mapper images. © 1991.},

abstract={This chapter reviews past progress toward enhancing the level and quality of organic matter in soil. Annual cropping replaced fallow in many areas, which has reduced organic matter loss from soil. Greater fertilizer use and varietal improvement increased cereal grain yield and straw production, which raised the level of C return to the soil. Carbon input has shown to have a significant impact on the organic matter level. Stubble-mulch and no-till systems conserved up to 2% more organic matter per year in surface soil than plowing. Crop rotation, green manuring, and reduced tillage practices have lost some of their glamour with the advent of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and many of the long-term experiments have been discarded for more pressing research. Fertilizer and tillage research has expanded, and crop improvement has received new impetus. Less reliance on crop rotation and green manure has beenpartially responsible for increasing use of inorganic fertilizer. Soil erosion tends to increase with less crop rotation and greater reliance on mechanical tillage and clean fallow. © 1991 Academic Press Inc.},

Included were sites that had been used in an erosion study between 1946 and 1959 at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa. The amount of soil loss was calculated from 137Cs loss and depths to contrasting layers, and deposition was estimated from the depths of Ap horizons. Soil loss was closely related to slope position and land use. Contents of OC, Nt, and Pa were reduced by soil loss. They were not restored at the midium- and coarse-textured sites after 17 years of continuous grass cover, but OC and Nt, and aggregate stability, were restored at the fine-textured site after 27 years of grass cover. © 1991.},

abstract={This study was initiated to determine the basic characteristics and genesis of soils on gentle to very steep slopes on two contrasting slope aspects. Two transects, a southwest (SW) and a northwest (NW) transect, were laid out on a sandstone ridge across the summit and steepest convex shoulder positions. The thickness of the O, A and E horizons was not related to slope gradient across soils on all slope gradients and aspects. This indicates that the present rate of soil formation is greater than erosion, the influence of erosion on steep slopes could be off-set by lateral movement of through-flow water above the B horizon, or the process of tree throw masks slope gradient effects. Solum depth, B horizon thickness, clay, Fe, and Al indexes decreased with increasing slope for both the NW and SW aspects. Organic carbon index decreased with increasing slope for the SW aspect. Decreases in effective precipitation over relatively larger surface areas at steep versus lower slope gradients, a longer influence of periglacial erosion following the Wisconsinan glacial advance, and present slow but significant soil creep could cause these differences in soil development across the slope. Solum depth, B horizon thickness, clay, Fe, and Al indexes showed a smaller decrease across the NW compared to the SW slope. Organic carbon did not decrease across the NW slope. The E horizon was also slightly thicker on the NW compared to the SW slope. These aspect differences were probably caused by less evaporation on "shaded" NW compared to "sunny" SW slopes which produce generally higher moisture levels and more effective eluviation and illuviation on the NW slope. © 1991.},

abstract={Three Aridisols, one Mollisol and one Entisol of a topographic sequence (catena) on calcareous materials of alluvial/colluvial fans on the piedmont slope of Sierra de Enmedio in the semiarid northeast of Mexico were examined. Detailed profile descriptions and laboratory studies included particle size distribution, pH, specific conductance, soil carbonate fractions, organic C, total N, and plant-available and water-soluble nutrients. During the youngest phase of morphodynamic stability, in which erosion processes were diminished, soils were formed from more or less eroded remnants of the fan sediments into extremely calcareous, very shallow to deep, brown, and poorly weathered soils with a loamy to extremely gravelly texture. The availability of nutrients was moderate for N, Cu, to very low for P, Fe, Zn. Only K and Mn showed adequate values. The sodium saturation of subsoils was also very low ion spite of the proximity of saline soils. Because of the unfavorable physical and chemical characteristics, the potential soil fertility is poor. Therefore, any use of these soils would only be possible by extensive grazing management or cultivation of technical-use crops like Agave spp., Aloe vera L., Dasylirion longissimum Lem., Larrea tridentata (DC) Cov., Opuntia spp., Simmondsia chinensis Link, and Yucca spp. adapted to dry conditions. Irrigated agriculture could also be carried out successfully on loamy riparian soils with low pebble content in the basin of sporadic water-bearing wadis or arroyos. © 1991 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Climate models predict a substantial warming at high latitudes following the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CH), and various other trace gases. Arctic and sub-Arctic soils contain large amounts of organic carbon that could be made increasingly available for decomposition in a wanner climate due to deepening of the biologically-active layer and increased thermokarst erosion. This produces the potential for increased emissions of C02 and CH4 from tundra areas and thus positive (enhancing) feedback effects on the greenhouse effect. From being a net absorber of C02 the global tundra areas could become a net source of up to 1.25 Gt C yr1 as a result of the predicted warmer and dryer conditions during the thaw period. CH4 is at least 21 times more effective as a greenhouse gas than C02. How the CH4 balance in the tundra will respond to climate change is therefore very important but also much less certain. Estimates of total present CH4 emissions from northern wetlands vary greatly, ranging from 2.4 to 106 Tg CH4 yr1 and little is known about the mechanisms controlling the flux. There are indications, however, that if the tundra becomes wetter under warming, CH4emissions would probably increase. If it becomes dryer, the emissions could cease or even turn the tundra into a sink for atmospheric CH4, partly due to increasing microbial consumption of CH4 in the soil. There is an urgent need for more research into the processes controlling the CH4 flux in Arctic and sub-Arctic soils. © 1991, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Arenites contain several types of non-carbonate intrabasinal (NCI) grains which are seldom given specific attention in petrographic studies. However, recognition and analysis of these particles may be of invaluable help for stratigraphic, paleogeographic and even metamorphic reconstructions. Rip-up clasts are the most common NCI grains in various depositional environments. Concentration of other NCI types, such as green peloids, ferruginous ooids, reworked phosphates, chert, soil fragments, black pebbles or pyrite clasts, occur at times of reduced sedimentation rates. During major transgressions, a wealth of iron, phosphorus, silica and organic matter of both terrestrial and marine origin is provided by rapid flooding of coastal plains, erosion of tropical soils developed during previous lowstands stages, and plankton blooms in nutrient-rich waters. -from Author},

abstract={The Middle to Late Eocene Chumstick Formation comprises >12 km of fluvial and lacustrine strata deposited in a strikeslip basin in Washington State. The Chumstick paleoflora is a mixed suite of broad-leaved evergreen and broad-leaved deciduous taxa, with physiognomic characteristics intermediate between paratropical and subtropical rainforest types. The Chumstick paleoflora probably occupied an intermediate paleogeographic position between lowland and montane rainforest, in a setting about 150 km inland from the Pacific coast at elevations up to about 750 m. Most plant macrofossils are found in proximal overbank sequences or on the preserved tops of emergent mid-channel bars. Certain taxa are more typical of floodplain versus channel-margin sites. Key differences were also noted between "upland" (proximal to fault scarps) and "lowland" taxa, which may be related to soil drainage. Chumstick paleosols include entisols (poor horizontal development), inceptisols (incipient Cca or K horizon development) and histosols (histic epipedons containing up to 6% total organic carbon). Paleovegetation had a significant effect on fluvial deposition in the Chumstick Formation. Even in coarse-grained, fault-proximal facies there is evidence for bank cohesion and stability, bank undercutting and failure, soil erosion, and overbank deposits. The dominance of vertical accretion over lateral channel migration in more distal deposits can be attributed to rapid subsidence, coupled with bank stability imparted by vegetation. © 1991.},

abstract={Shrubland vegetation and environmental data in western Shewa, Ethiopia have been analysed. Vegetation data include cover‐abundance values of vascular plant species; environmental data comprise physical and chemical properties of the soil, altitude, slope, grazing and browsing pressure. The vegetation data were subj ected to hierarchical and non‐hierarchical classification and ordination with correspondence analysis. The classification resulted in seven different vegetation types, ranging from grassland with scattered shrubs to degenerated forest. Ordination of the data and biplot analysis showed that the vegetation is influenced by anthropogenic factors and altitudinal variation. Sand content is related to a low level of anthropogenic influence whereas silt content is related to a high level. This is explained by historical events rather than by the present situation. Total nitrogen, organic carbon, altitude and slope are positively correlated and these variables are negatively related to anthropogenic influences. The shrubland vegetation may have expanded from lower altitudes and drier sites as forests gradually disappeared. The recovery of an economically more rewarding vegetation type may be achieved through pro viding alternative sources of fuel and construction and through prohibiting cultivation and grazing in the shrublands on the hillsides. Regeneration can be accelerated by actively introducing seedlings of tree species that do not need a heavy canopy cover for establishment and growth. 1991 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science},

abstract={Caesium-137 (137Cs) redistribution has been used to quantify erosion for periods of up to 35 years. One of the basic tenets of the 137Cs technique is that sampling of an uneroded (control) area will provide a baseline input level of 137Cs fallout. The problem with many 137Cs studies is that they have failed to characterize the statistical variability of 137Cs within the control locations, and thus their estimates of sediment redistribution are biased. The primary objective of this study was to determine the variability of 137Cs in three control locations in Saskatchewan. The locations differed with respect to soil type, vegetation and gradient. The 137Cs areal activities (Bq m-2) were not correlated with organic carbon concentration, dispersed particle size fractions, and several topographical parameters calculated from a digital elevation model. Caesium-137 was randomly distributed, with no indication of erosion, or solution transport. Caesium-137 was normally distributed and autocorrelation analysis indicated no serial correlation. Classical statistics were used to estimate that between 12 and 20 samples were required to estimate the population mean 137Cs activity at the 95% confidence level with an allowable error of ±10%. There were no significant differences in 137Cs activity between control locations. Therefore, data from 75 sample sites were pooled, and the arithmetic mean and 95% confidence band for 137Cs was 2150±100 Bq m-2. © 1991.},

abstract={We studied peat in several geologic and climatic settings: (1) a glaciated terrain in cold-temperate Maine and Minnesota, U.S.A.; (2) an island in a temperate maritime climate in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Maine, U.S.A., where sea level is rising rapidly and changing the environment of peat accumulation; (3) swamps along the warm-temperate U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, where sea level has changed often, thus creating sites for accumulation; and (4) in a tropical climate along the coast of Sarawak, Malaysia, and the delta of the Batang Hari River, Sumatra, Indonesia (Figs. 1 and 2). With the exception of the deposits on the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, most of the deposits described are domed bogs in which peat accumulation continued above the surface of the surrounding soil. The bogs of the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains have almost level surfaces. All domed bogs are not entirely ombrotrophic (watered only from precipitation); multidomed bogs that rise from irregular or hilly surfaces may be crossed by streams that supply water to the bogs. The geologic processes or organic sedimentation, namely terrestrialization and paludification, are similar in all peat deposits considered here. Differences in geomorphology affecting the quantity and that quality of peat that has ash contents of less than 25%, which are desirable for commercial purposes, depend chiefly on: (1) high humidity, which is favorable to luxuriant growth of peat-forming vegetation; (2) a depositional setting that permits extensive accumulation relatively free from inorganic contamination from sea water and streams and from dust and volcanic ash; and (3) a stable regional water table that controls the rate of decomposition under aerobic conditions and protects the deposit against the ravages of fire. Differences in peat textures are due to the type of vegetation and to the degree of decomposition. The rate of decomposition is largely the result of the amount of oxidation and aerobic microbial activity. Stratigraphic distribution of various textures and amounts of inorganic components within a peat deposit is largely determined by the vertical positions occupied by peat-forming environments, such as pond, marsh, swamp and heath where vegetation accumulated, and the depth to zones of unoxygenated water. Peat also differs in the rate of accumulation. On the basis of carbon-14 dating, an estimated 8 m of peat in the tropical Batang Hari River deposit in Sumatra has been accumulating at the rate of about 1.5 m/1,000 yr, whereas peat in the cold-temperate deposit in Maine has been accumulating at the rate of 0.66 m/1,000 yr. Accumulation rates in domed deposits such as these are affected not only by factors controlling volume of biomass and aerobic decay but also by stream erosion and fires that remove peat. Such disconformities (see Fig. 2) within the deposit may be recognized by sudden vertical changes in degree of decomposition and/or the presence of charcoal. The trace-element content of peat deposits is affected by the environments of their settings. Samples of peat that have an ash content of less than 25% dry weight and that are from small, almost level swamp deposits along the Atlantic Coastal Plain of North Carolina were compared with similar samples from small domed bogs in Maine, a glaciated area. Samples from Nort Carolina, which are from deposits in thick fluvial and nearshore marine sediments far from the bedrock source, are generally higher in Ti, Cr and Pb. The Maine samples from deposits in glacial drift close to the bedrock source contain more Zn, Mn, P, Ca, Na and Fe. The kind and amount of trace elements within the deposits appear to relate largely to depositional setting, to kinds of bedrock source, and to the modes of transportation from source to peat swamp. Trace-element concentrations in the extensive Sumatra peat deposit, which represents a potentially commercial coal bed, are similar to those found in Appalachian coals except for As and Au, which are higher in the former. This similarity most likely implies that geochemical controls on mineral matter controlled the concentrations in both. Most peat deposits found in the world today are not precursors of economic coal beds because they are too local in extent, lack beds of commercial-quality peat greater than 6 m thick, and/or are too far from sea level to be rapidly by marine or marginal marine sediments before destruction by erosion and decomposition. However, the two domed deposits in Sarawak and Sumatra described above are parts of extensive, thick, low-sulfur, fuel-quality peat deposits, which have bases below the levels of rivers on coastal deltas. These are likely to be preserved in their lower part and to become precursors of tropical coal seams of potential economic importance. The lenticular and tabular peat deposits of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, which have little chance of survival, have features resembling those in Tertiary peat deposits in alluvial settings of western North America. The quality, shape, and extent of modern and ancient peat deposits are controlled by the same factors - humidity, vegetation type, ground- and surface-water regimes, and physiographic and geologic setting. Thus, a study of modern peat deposits may help in studies of the areal distribution and the thickness and quality of ancient coal beds. © 1990.},

abstract={Abstract: The subtropical region is defined here as roughly the zone of 10° to 35° N and S of the equator, with a pronounced seasonal rainfall, with about 2 to 4.5 months in which precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration by 75%. Rain falls mainly in summer in contrast to the Mediterranean Region with a winter rainfall season. The area covered by the subtropics is around 18 million km2, mainly in Africa South of Sahara and smaller regions in Asia (India), Australia and South and North America. The area of the Mediterranean region cover close to 9 million km2 mostly in Southern Europe, North Africa and the Near East. General circulation models for the condition of a double CO2 concentration are not consistent in predicting the moisture conditions. Some models predict a decrease in precipitation and soil moisture, especially in the summer months, which would result in a considerably change in the moisture regime both on cotenary slopes and in individual pedons. In general these are very fragile environments, sensitive to climatic change, partly because of the high variability and seasonality of the climatic parameters. The major soil groups in the two regions are Luvisols, Acrisols, Vertisols, Cambisols, Arenosols and Fluvisols. Six major soil responses can become evident within a short time of less than 50 years: 1) organic matter reduction; 2) carbonate and salt regime changes; 3) erosion; 4) crusting; 5) waterlogging; and 6) fire frequency. Among these the reduction of organic matter due to increased temperature should be most easily modelled and is of special importance because of a positive feed back effect on additional temperature increase. The soil carbonate regime and salt balance may be affected by both decreasing and increasing precipitation. Salinization on footslopes may be caused by increased rainfall upslope. Changes in intensity and seasonality of rainfall will result in increased runoff and erosion, in other cases surface crusting. Reduced infiltration in clayey soils may cause waterlogging downslope. Prolonged drought periods may cause an increased fire frequency and result in subsequent severe erosion. The response action will depend not only on more precise prediction of the climatic parameters but also on the nature of the soils, their texture, structure, depth and spatial variability. Much detailed research on soil distribution and sensitivity to changes is needed. The basic soil processes are well known and understood, but their actual rates and possible feedbacks are known to a much lesser extent. © 1990.},

abstract={Degradation of agricultural land by cultivation has frequently been reported but few studies have attempted to quantify its severity, particularly with respect to those properties important to erosion. This study attempts to quantify some important properties that may be influenced by cultivation of two soil series. Delineations of a Typic Hapludalf (Russell series) and Typic Argiudoll (Catlin series) with adjacent cultivated and virgin components were studied to determine the effects of long-term cultivation on porosity, bulk density (Db), aggregate size, and organic carbon (OC) distribution through the profile. Porosity was quantified using image analysis on thin sections and Db measurements as determined by the clod and excavation methods, aggregate size and stability were determined using wet sieving, and OC was determined by wet combustion. The cultivated component of the Udalf had a greater Db in the upper 50cm as compared to the virgin component. The cultivated surface had a greater number of fine and unconnected pores compared to the virgin surface. The aggregate size distribution of the A horizon for each soil was larger in the virgin condition, but there was a greater difference in the Udalf as compared to the Udoll. As OC decreased Db increased through the upper 50cm of the Udalf profiles. Long-term cultivation increased the potential erosion in these soil series by decreasing potential infiltration as a result of increased Db, reduction of interconnecting pores, finer aggregate size and reduced aggregate stability. Erodibility was also increased through reduction in organic matter and aggregate size. © 1990.},

abstract={Rainfall modifies random roughness (RR) at varying rates for different soils. Methods to estimate RR decay are needed for computer models which simulate physical processes occurring at or near the soil surface. The objective of this study was to estimate RR decay curves as a function of soil properties. Surface roughness has been reported for selected soils before and after simulated rainfall (5 to 80 mm on five soils, 35 to 300 mm on one soil) and before and after natural rainfall (7 to 350 mm on two soils). The soils represent a wide range of textural and physical properties. A modified exponential function was fit to normalized RR values (RR after rainfall/initial RR) using rainfall amount as an independent variable. The coefficients of this function were then approximated as a function of two soil properties: percentage organic carbon and percentage clay. Surface stability increased with greater amounts of organic carbon. Surface stability increased with clay content to about 31% and then decreased with greater amounts of clay. Random roughness decay curves may be estimated for specific soils by using the exponential function.},

Excessive tillage or use of bulldozers for land clearance resulted in removal of the surface few centimetres of soil rich in organic carbon, exposure of subsoil and rapid oxidation of the organic fraction and a decline in soil fertility. Banana yields were shown to be related closely to degree of pre-plant tillage, yields being highest where the soil was not cultivated or disturbed. In the third case study, excessive use of clean cultivation techniques and a failure to adequately cover the soil as protection against runoff during heavy tropical downpours has been shown to result in removal of surface soil from convex slope zones and deposition on concave areas. -from Author},

abstract={An extensive study was conducted to measure spatial patterns in aggregate stability in the steep, hilly, and highly erodible loessial soils of the Palouse region in southeastern Washington. Soil samples were collected at 20-m spacings along four 800-m-long transects within a winter wheat field and analyzed for aggregate stability at a slow and a fast rate of wetting, organic C, amorphous Fe, soil water content, and particle size distribution. Aggregate stability under slow wetting, organic C, and clay content were significantly different at summit, shoulder, toeslope, and footslope positions on the landscape. More specifically, aggregate stability and organic C content were highest in footslope and toeslope positions, and lowest at the summit. Clay content was highest at the summit and lowest in footslope positions. Aggregate stability at a fast rate of wetting had a coefficient of variation (40%) that was nearly double that for slow wetting, and was not well correlated to either landscape position or measured soil properties such as amorphous Fe and water or clay content were only weakly correlated to aggregate stability. Thus, although the spatial patterns in aggregate stability exhibited moderate variability (CV = 22%), the patterns were closely related to changes in a few key properties, namely, organic C content and landscape position. A likely explanation for these findings is that soil erosion removes the topsoil and organic matter from the ridgetops, thus exposing subsoil horizons, which are higher in clay content and lower in aggregate stability.},

Results indicate that more adverse changes took place in soils under large‐scale irrigation than in those under smallholder farms during the periods under consideration. Agricultural sustainability is more likely to be achieved for smallholder farms than for large‐scale irrigation where soil degradation resulting from loss of fine soil particles through erosion can be a serious hindrance to long‐term land use. In order to achieve agricultural sustainability in Kano State, it is recommended that chemical fertilizers be incorporated into the smallholder farming system, while the adoption of suitable soil conservation practices would make the large‐scale irrigation systems more stable and sustainable.

Tillage treatments were: (1) ploughing, harrowing and ridging (conventional); (2) digger-made holes (minimum); (3) pushing the sharpened end of cassavs cuttigs directly into the soil (no-till). Tillage did not affect total biomass yields in the first year. In the second year, significant differences were obtained in the yield of tops but not of fresh roots. No-till and minimum tillage out-yielded the conventional system by 40% and 23%, respectively, in the yield of tops,. It was apparent that elimination of ploughing did not reduce total biomass yield. Soil moisture contents in no-till and minimum tillage were significantly higher (P = 0.05) than in the conventional-tillage system. Conv organic carbon decresed significantly (P = 0.01) over time in all tillage systems. Conventional tillage gave the highest reduction.

abstract={The review examines the literature concerning the effects on soil profile development of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and termites (Isoptera), two prominent insect groups in the Australian environment. Their pedological influence is largely through the construction of nests, galleries, soil sheetings and mounds. Some of the pedological effects are manifested in the physical modification of the soil profile through selecting, transporting and rearranging soil particles. Within this group, findings in areas such as soil turnover, mound longevity, bioturbation, soil structure and water infiltration are discussed. Termites contribute actively to soil turnover, and the contribution of termite sheetings and ant mounds to soil turnover is also being recognized. Termite mounds may persist in the landscape for more than two decades, while ant mound longevity varies from weeks to decades. Information on the effects of ants and termites on soil structure and water infiltration is sparse; but ants and termites seem to either increase infiltration by improving soil structure and porosity, or to decrease infiltration by producing compact surfaces which assist runoff and erosion. Other effects involve the chemical alteration of the soil profile by ants and termites collecting and transporting live and dead animal and plant materials to their nest structures, and by the additions of secretions and excreta in nest construction. The majority of ants and termites probably increase carbon and nutrient levels, especially nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, as well as exchangeable magnesium and calcium. The extent of the increases depends greatly on the type of mound construction and the degree to which organic material is incorporated. Problems with research techniques include the use of a variety of sampling techniques by different researchers, lack of detailed soil description or classification, and inadequate description of location of sampling points. These deficiencies make it difficult to draw valid comparisons between research projects. Many researchers also base their generalizations on ant or termite soil modifications on a small number of samples, although during the 1980s there has been an increase in sample sizes. Contradictory data often result from projects being undertaken on different species and in different environments. Future research directions need to include a greater concentration on the morphology of ant nests, more detailed assessment of the influence of ants and termites on soil structure and water infiltration, an increase in biopedological research in human-modified environments, a greater emphasis on termites and ants other than the most dominant or prominent species, and a focus on community as distinct from single-species effects. © CSIRO 1990.},

abstract={Hydrocarbons in soil samples from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, were studied to examine their features and to elucidate source materials. Normal-alkanes and n-alkenes were found at concentrations ranging from 13 to 2200 and from 1.1 to 5000 ng/g of dry soil, respectively. Unexpectedly, the major hydrocarbons were all odd-carbon numbered long-chain n-alkanes with maximum concentrations n-C23, nC25 or n-C27. This may be due to the erosion of sedimentary materials containing vascular plant debris formed during the pre- and inter-glaciation periods of Antarctica (Miocene-Pliocene) and microbial debris, such as fungi and microalgae. Normal-alkenes maximize at n-C23:1 (carbon chain length: number of double bonds), n-C25:1, n-C27:1 or n-C29:2, which could be derived from cyanobacteria and microalgae, that lived in the past in the Antarctic cold desert and/or organic debris of wind-transported cyanobacterial mats. © 1990.},

abstract={Organic geochemical studies of 12 soil samples from Wright and Taylor Valleys of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Ross Desert) in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, were carried out. Long-chain n-alkanoic acids (C20-C34), with predominance of even-carbon numbers, were abundant in all the samples. 3-Hydroxy acids (C8-C30) with a predominance of even-carbon numbers were found in the samples, together with 2-, ω- and (ω-1)-hydroxy acids. α,ω-Dicarboxylic acids (C8-C31) were detected having near-unity values of carbon preference indices; mainly the C13 dicarboxylic acid predominated. Visual kerogen revealed that amorphous materials are major components (68-98%) with small amounts of very fine coals (2-32%), but no woody and herbaceous materials. The occurrence of mature isomers of steranes and triterpanes, the paucity of n-alkenoic acids and data from the microscopic study suggest that organic components in the soil samples are derived from erosion of Beacon Supergroup sedimentary rocks and past biological debris containing vascular plan waxes as well as wind-transported cyano-bacterial mats, including cyanobacteria, microalgae, bacteria and fungi, rather than from living organisms. © 1990.},

abstract={Three sediment cores from two lakes, Fish Lake and Phalarope Lake, in Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, N.W.T. were analyzed for diatoms and chemical composition. Multivariate statistical techniques using a range of chemical variables successfully isolated three sediment groupings in the cores. Allochthonous and autochthonous chemical components in the sediments have been used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions. The two lakes began approximately 10600 years ago as shallow marine lagoons that were isolated from the sea as a result of glacio-isostatic rebound. Based on the presence of distinctive diatom assemblages, the three stratigraphic zones are identified as a basal marine zone, an intermediate and transitional brackish/marine zone and an upper freshwater zone. Following isolation from the sea, the lakes were flushed with freshwater produced by snow and ice melt. In Fish Lake, the period of transition from marine to freshwater, which began approximately 7000 years ago, lasted approximately 800 years. In Phalarope Lake, which was isolated from the sea approximately 5000 years ago, flushing by fresh water was completed only within the last 300 years. Fe, Cr, and Mo in the sediments are associated with the isolation phase when lake sedimentation is sensitive to the presence of brackish water and erosion within the lake catchments. In particular, the precipitation of Mo as MoS2 reflects the presence of hypolimnetic anoxia associated with lake isolation. During the early post-isolation phase the response of lake biota to an influx of nutrients is reflected in an increase in biological silica and organic carbon in the lake sediments. On the other hand, the generally low organic content of the sediments indicates that sedimentation in these lakes has been largely determined by variations in non-biogenic factors through time. During the mid Holocene the progressive stabilization of surface materials within the lake catchments is marked by decreasing Cr, As and Na in the sediments. At the same time, an increase in allochthonous Mn and Fe is attributed to progressive soil development. During the last 2500 years the catchments have experienced decreased erosion resulting in a decrease in both allochthonous clastic input and lake productivity. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={A soil organic matter turnover model has been developed to analyse soil carbon (soil organic‐C) loss caused by organic matter decomposition and rainfall erosion in soils used for permanent cultivation. It has been used to build up model profiles of five soils, one occurring in temperate and four in tropical regions, on the basis of estimates for ‘natural’ organic matter input. Organic matter input data for different systems of cultivation were used to model the long‐term decomposition of soil organic‐C in these model profiles. The modelling results show that soil organic matter decomposition in the tropics is three to four times faster than in temperate regions, and that there is a marked influence of soil type and soil climate. Simulated losses of organic‐C in the tropical soils, not accounting for erosion are 31 to 50 per cent after 50 years and 43 to 63 per cent after 100 years of continuous cultivation. The simulated loss of soil organic‐C when rainfall erosion is also allowed for is 40 to 80 per cent. Erosion caused an extra loss of at least 7 per cent after 100 years. The initial input of charcoal from forest burning is lost through erosion at a rate of 50 to almost 100 per cent, depending on the severity of erosion. The sensitivity of modelling results to variations in input data was also analysed. The losses of soil carbon were also used to calculate the global flux of CO2 from soils. Soils are probably a small but not negligible source of CO2. Copyright © 1989 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Soils of the Palouse region of eastern Washington State were investigated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) band ratios to discriminate areas where erosion has caused paleosols to be exposed. Ratioed data were clustered and plotted to show soil lines which could be subdivided into various levels of organic matter and iron oxides. Successfully classified scenes of a summer fallow (bare soil) field were obtained with band ratios 1 4, 3 4 and 5 4 to map organic carbon and 3 4, 5 4, and 5 3 for the iron/carbon ratio indicator of erosion. Regression models were made with 5 4 data and organic carbon and 5 3 data and the iron/carbon ratio. Based on this analysis, 21% of the test field soils are exposed or nearly exposed paleosols. © 1989.},

abstract={Peat has been studied in several geologic settings: (1) glaciated terrain in cold temperate Maine and Minnesota, U.S.A.; (2) an island in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Maine, where sea level is rising; (3) the warm temperate U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, where sea level has changed often; and (4) the tropical coast of Sarawak, Malaysia, and the tropical delta of the Batang Hari River, Sumatra, Indonesia. Most of these deposits are domed (ombrotrophic or partly ombrotrophic) bogs in which peat accumulation continued above the surface of the surrounding soil. However, the bogs of the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains are comparatively not as domed, and many have almost level surfaces. In some bogs, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant materials accumulated, replaced water in the depressions, and formed a surface on which marsh or swamp vegetation could subsequently live, die, and accumulate. In others, the plant materials accumulated initially on level silt or sand surfaces supporting marshes or swamps. As the peat dome formed, plants growing on it changed from luxuriant ones near the base of the dome, where nutrients were brought into the bog by surface and ground water, to stunted ones at the top of the dome, where the raised bogs are fed by nutrient-poor precipitation. The physical and chemical changes that take place in the sequence of environments from the pond stage of deposit development, through the grassy marsh stage, through the forested swamp stage, and finally through the heath dome stage can be measured in terms of acidity and ash, volatile matter, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen contents, as well as in the kind and distribution of trace elements. The organic and inorganic contents of the deposits relate to geomorphology, and geomorphology relates to their settings. As models of coal formation, some domed peat deposits may help in solving problems of distribution and character of ancient coal beds. But clearly not all peat deposits are precursors of coal. Most Holocene peat deposits are subject to destruction by erosion, fire and decomposition through microbial and chemical oxidation before burial. The best environments for coal precursors have biomass accumulation, a continuously rising water table within the mass, and minimum influx of clay and silt until preservation by burial. The most suitable settings for future economic coal deposits are domed bogs that accumulate thick, widespread peat having low ash and low sulfur contents. The ombrotrophic peat deposits of tropical Sarawak and Sumatra are thick and extensive, contain low-ash and low-sulfur peat, and have high heating values. They are considered to be the best tropical coal analogs because of their extent and chances of preservation; the base of the peat is below adjacent river levels, and chemical and structural conditions are favorable for accumulation. © 1989.},

abstract={The morphology and selected physical, mineralogic, and chemical characteristics of pedons collected in seven North Dakota wetlands were examined to investigate the development of hydric soils associated with wetlands of the Northern Plains. The wetlands were chosen using established field criteria to be representative of ground-water recharge, flowthrough, and discharge conditions. All profiles collected in recharge wetlands were nonsaline, free of carbonate, and exhibited clay illuviation to some degree, the result of seasonal ponding, fluctuating water tables, and downward, saturated water flow characteristic of recharge conditions. Recharge profiles also exhibited continuous sediment aggradation due to erosion of the surrounding upland and deposition in the wetland. High organic matter production under such conditions resulted in overthickened A-horizons. Soil classes ranged from Typic Argiaquolls if argillic horizons are present, to Cumulic Haplaquolls if illuviation was not as well expressed. Soil development in the wet-meadow and shallow-marsh zones of flowthrough wetlands was influenced by higher, more stable, more brackish water tables. Profile morphology reflected a continuum from dominantly-recharge to dominantly-discharge hydrology. All profiles were calcareous. The more saline profiles also contained gypsum. Soil classes ranged from Cumulic Haplaquolls of calcareous, mixed mineralogy to Typic Calciaquolls. The presence of high, saline water tables and mechanical sorting of soil surfaces by wave action retarded soil development in the discharge wetland periphery. Soils were uniformly saline, calcareous, and gypsiferous. Soil classes ranged from Fluvaquentic Haplaquolls to Typic Fluvaquents. © 1988 Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={Lake Miragoane, Haiti is one of the largest, natural freshwater lakes in the Caribbean (A=7.06 km2, zmax=41.0 m, conductivity = 350 μS cm-1). Lake waters are dominated by calcium and bicarbonate ions. The lake was thermally stratified, and oxygen profiles were clinograde during summer visits in 1983 and 1985. A 72-cm mud-water interface core was taken near the center of the lake and dated with 210Pb. The local 210Pb fallout rate is low (0.09 pCi cm-2 yr-1), about 20% of the global average. Bulk sedimentation rates ranged from 0.008 to 0.030 g cm-2 yr-1 during the past 130 years (0-8 cm depth). Sediment geochemistry and pollen have been analyzed in the topmost 58 cm of the section. Tentative ages were assigned to the core by extrapolation of 210Pb dates. According to this preliminary chronology, the bottom part of the core (58-30 cm) records pre-Columbian sedimentation (1000-500 B.P.) and contains pollen evidence of intact, dry and mesic forest. Pre-Columbian deposits are rich in organic matter (x = 30%) and relatively poor in carbonates (x = 15% as CO2). The top 30 cm of the core preserve the record since European contact (500 B.P. to present). Pollen data reveal two episodes of deforestation following European arrival. Consequent soil erosion is documented by a decrease in organic matter content (x = 15%) and an increase in carbonates (x = 27% as CO2). Surficial sediments reflect the widespread deforestation and soil loss that characterize the watershed today. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={An approach and methodology for characterizing behavior of crop-soil systems as they may be modified by soil erosion were applied to a Cecil-Pacolet soil (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludults) landscape cropped to soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. In each of two years crop and soil measurements along with determination of slope and landscape position were made on slightly, moderately and severely eroded sites in 24 farm fields of which 8 were common to both years. Daily rainfall was recorded during the crop season on each field. Among the 40 variables selected to characterize the system behavior were dynamic or within-season, among-season, and static variables. Search for and identification of variables which determine most of the soybean yield variability have been adopted as the primary objectives in determining behavior of the crop-soil system. Recognizing the strong functional dependencies among a number of the variables, we used multivariate statistical procedures that are based upon eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis of the matrix of correlation coefficients among all variates. Results of using factor analysis and components regression to identify variate contributions to yields of soybeans are reported. In linear, non-interactive analyses, variate contributions to yield were evaluated. The major contribution of clay and organic carbon contents in the surface 0.1 m of soil to soybean yield variations in both seasons identifies soil water as the regulating variable. © 1988.},

Mound cover and density are 40% and 450 mounds/ha respectively. Mound and intermound soils present a similar textural composition as well as a similar coarse fragment content (10-20%). Root and organic matter contents are significantly higher whereas calcium carbonate is significantly lower in the mound than in the intermound soils. Mounds may represent a relict land surface level, lowered in the intermound area mainly by wash erosion. Mound development is related to discrete shrub clumps that shelter the underlying soil. Once established, the shrub clump and the underlying mound remain as a stable and self maintained system. © 1988.},

abstract={Off-road vehicle (ORV) impact on the landscape includes the destruction of protective vegetative cover, soil compaction, and increased runoff followed by increased erosion. An investigation of three State Vehicular Recreation Areas (SVRAs) in arid regions of California have documented 10-to 25-fold increases in sediment yield relative to nearby undisturbed basins. Soil texture and slope length are the dominant factors controlling soil erodibility in these areas. Organic carbon content of the soil exposed in hillclimb gullies was comparable to C horizon values of undisturbed soil profiles demonstrating a significant (70%) loss of soil fertility due to accelerated erosion. Soil erosion can be minimized and lifespan of these recreational areas prolonged by initiating and enforcing some critical management policies, including careful control over location and length of hillclimb, rotating use areas such that rehabilitation or revegetation is feasible, and seasonal use restrictions. © 1987 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

Variations in A horizon thickness and organic carbon content explained about 65% of the variation in 137Cs. Soil losses predicted by the USLE were better correlated with soil losses calculated from 137Cs when the 137Cs data were used to delineate slope segments that were subjected to erosion than when 137Cs and USLE soil losses were calculated on a field basis. The USLE overestimated soil losses at high erosion rates. -from Authors},

abstract={A 3-year study on the influence of some common rush control techniques on soil erosion was conducted on a clay loam site in low to fair range condition. Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) control by shredding, mechanical grubbing, vibratilling, and foliar spraying with 2, 4, 5-T+picloram reduced erosion. Plowing, disking, and seeding to kleingrass (Panicum coloratum) did not reduce erosion compared to the check. Brush control treatments removed mesquite competition, thus increasing the standing crop and cover of herbaceous plants. On the kleingrass, shred, foliar spray, mechanical grub, and check treatments, the amount of plant material protecting the soil surface was the most important variable controlling soil loss. Plant cover, standing crop, organic carbon, and total porosity all related positively to each other. As plant cover and biomass increased, organic carbon and porosity increased and erosion decreased. The absence of grazing for 3 years did not change site condition sufficiently to reduce erosion on the check.-Authors},

abstract={The concentrations of lipids were determined in atmospheric particle, gas and rain samples collected from the tropical North Pacific to assess lipid sources, transport mechanisms and fluxes to the ocean surface. Four lipid compound classes (aliphatic hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols, fatty acid esters, and salts) all unequivocally show a terrestrial vascular plant source. These aerosol lipids originate from wind erosion of Asian and American soils and direct emission from vegetation. The major fluxes result from rain rather than dry deposition. These fluxes are large enough to have a major potential impact on the inventory of terrestrially derived lipid material found in deep-sea sediments. This has been showm for n-alkanes, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, total lipids and for organic carbon. By comparing atmospheric and sediment trap fluxes with sediment accumulation rates, it is suggested that some biogenic terrestrial material is more protected from degradation than marine-derived material. © 1986 Pergamon Journals Ltd.},

abstract={Five age series stands of Alnus nepalensis D. Don monocultures have been selected from the Pankhasari range of the Kalimpong forest division in the Eastern Himalayas. Chemical soil propeties such as organic carbon, total nitrogen, C:N ratio, available phosphorus and exchangeable cations (Ca+2, K+ and Na+) were analysed in all these different ages of plantation stands from the surface to 1 m deep profiles to find out the long term effect of A. nepalensis on the soil quality of these erosion vulnerable slopes. Organic carbon, available phosphorus and total nitrogen content per-hectare increased with increasing plantation stand age. Analysis of variance for nutrients showed significant variation in depth (total nitrogen P&lt;0.001; organic carbon, P&lt;0.001; available phosphorus, P&lt;0.05; exchangeable Ca+2, P&lt;0.01; and exchangeable K+, P&lt;0.01) and between plantation stands (organic carbon, P&lt;0.05; and available phosphorus P&lt;0.05). High value of total nitrogen content (34.97t ha-1) was obtained in 46 yr old stand. Soil pH is low. It increased down the depth and in older plantations. These stands with high soil total nitrogen and organic carbon content show increased fertility of the stands. The cover of A. nepalensis in rocky, landslide and ecosion prone slopes of the Eastern Himalayas, serves to protect and improve soil quality. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W. Junk Publishers.},

abstract={A systematic method was developed, supported by actual yield measurements to rank soils based on their productivity. Soil productivity functions in the form of linear equations with coefficients generated from multiple regression analyses were developed from experimental research plot areas. Hay yields under a high level of management were collected along with climate data. The soils at each of the eight plot areas were mapped, described, sampled, characterized, classified, and interpreted. Five parameters were identified which account for 56% of the yield variation. In descending order of significance, these factors were: (1) rainfall-soil storage, (2) effective drainage class, (3) organic carbon, (4) temperature, and (5) sum of bases. For most soils in the study, soil erosion would result in a significant reduction in water storage capacity and in a lower organic carbon content which reduces hay yields and soil productivity.

abstract={Local soil erosion has long been a problem on very fine sandy and silty soils in south Somerset. Some 40 fields in arable use were chosen randomly and monitored monthly for erosion in the winter of 1982–3. Erosion was measured along fixed traverses and then compared with soil attributes, site factors and cultivation practices. Winter cereals were worst affected with a third of the fields having soil losses in excess of 4 m3/ha. There was least erosion on bare ploughed ground and moderate losses on cash root crops. Soil type, organic-carbon content, clay content, drill direction, wheeling density and slope all affected soil loss in winter cereal fields. Erosion did not assume serious proportions until a combination of soil surface conditions and soil wetness allowed run-off to form rills. Only moderate falls of rain were then needed for widespread removal of soil. Preventative measures include grassing slope convexities, more grass in the rotation to improve soil organic matter and structure, avoiding wheelings, drilling across the slope and keeping headland widths to a minimum. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

abstract={Soils of the watersheds that furnish part of the water supply for Tehran have undergone considerable erosion. In this study, we examined five soils representing the major landforms on part of the watershed of the JaJerud River and Latyan Reservoir. The soils occur on the Hezar-dareh formation, a poorly cemented conglomerate and volcanic ash; the Green Beds, which are thinly bedded mudstone; and on alluvial-colluvial materials derived from the Hezardareh and Green Beds. Chemical, physical, and mineralogical properties are reported, with explanations of the influence of erosion, effective precipitation, and position of the landscape on the soil morphology and genesis. All the soils are calcareous and nonsaline, with a pH range of 7.5 to 8.1. Organic carbon decreases regularly with depth, even in the soils on the stream terrace positions, indicating that, if these soils have undergone flooding in the past, evidence of cyclic accumulations of organic carbon have been obliterated. The soils on steep slope gradients, more than 10%, are classified as Torriorthents and Calciorthids. The soils on nearly level slopes, less than 2%, are classified as Xerochrepts because of the mottling, cambic horizons and more effective precipitation due to less runoff, possible runin, and less removal of weathering products by erosion. © 1985 The Williams & Wilkins Co.},

abstract={The effects of cultivation and erosion on organic matter transformations were studied by systematically sampling slope positions on three paired rangeland and cropland toposequences. The toposequences were on differing parent materials, sandstone, siltstone and shale in southwestern North Dakota. Soils weathered from the three parent materials were all Haploborolls or Argiborolls but differed in texture and solum depth. Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and soil loss have been previously measured. Microbial biomass C and N by chloroform fumigation, mineralizable C and N during 10, 20 and 60 day incubations, and organic C and N content were measured. Decreases in the above soil properties occurred in cropland soils, but the proportion of organic N mineralized increased. Biomass and mineralizable C and N concentrations were correlated with organic C and N concentrations, rather than with total accumulation in the profile. Total accumulation and proportion of N mineralized were correlated with clay content. Changes in respiration:mineralization, mineralization:biomass and microbial C:N ratios suggested differences in substrate and microbial population composition between rangeland and cropland. Microbial biomass and mineralization rates did not vary with slope position, but parent material had significant effects. The siltstone site which had the highest soil losses began with the highest microbial biomass and mineralizable C and N concentrations and had the highest losses. The sandstone site suffered high soil but low OM constituent losses whereas the shale site suffered low soil and OM constituent losses. The sites can be classified in terms of their response to perturbation using concepts of "resistance" and "resilience" from ecosystem theory. The sandstone and shale sites may both be considered "resistant" with respect to agricultural perturbation, whereas the siltstone site was not. © 1985.},

Soil compaction, as well as granulometric changes, affect physical structure, and erosion exposes less fertile lower layers. Macro-ecological concerns which have been raised include: increased atmospheric carbon dioxide causing global warming due to a 'greenhouse effect'; changes in the hydrological cycle leading in the direction of dryness both within and outside of the tropical regions being cleared; and loss of genetic diversity through the extinction of species and ecosystems. Deforestation also implies the disappearance of indigenous cultures and populations dependent on the presence of rainforest.-from Author Nat Inst for Amazonian Res (INPA), Manaus, Brazil.},

abstract={This study evaluates the effects of cultivation and topography on soil properties. Four toposequences (one uncultivated and three cultivated since 1910, 1930 and 1961) were sampled and their horizon depths, bulk densities, soil losses, organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (P) contents compared. Thin sola and A horizons with relatively high bulk densities and low amounts of organic matter, total N and total P at upper slope positions on cultivated fields indicated maximum erosional activity. Organic matter, total N and total P contents were increased in areas of deposition at lower landscape positions, whereas the thickness of the sola and A horizons increased and bulk density decreased. Substantial reductions in N, in excess of the amount removed by grain and straw, occurred with continuing cultivation. Lower slopes lost less N on a percent basis but absolute losses were greater than on upper slopes. Long term P fertilization maintained total P in the A Horizon of cultivated toposequences at levels similar to the thicker A horizon of the Native toposequence. Losses of P from non-eroded sites were comparatively less than losses of C or N. If the cultivated toposequence as a whole is considered, the largest C losses were due to mineralization in lower slope areas and were more than double the amounts lost by erosion at upper slope areas. In upper slope areas mineralization accounted for the largest portion of total C lost in the early years of cultivation, whereas erosion accounted for the largest portion in later years. © 1985.},

abstract={Of four impoverished communities of benthic macro-infauna in Saint John harbour, three were attributable to anthropogenic causes: disposal of solid wood wastes, dredging, and dumping activity. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the fourth community resulted from strong tidal currents present in the inner harbour interacting with the sediment causing periodic erosion and deposition, resulting in an impoverished macro-infauna. The dredged area was rapidly recolonized; first by invasive species such as Capitella capitata and Nereis sp. and then by species present in adjacent sediments. The area adversely affected by dumping was of limited extent: of the order of 1 km2, as indicated by the presence of exotic species in dump soil and the distribution of organic carbon. © 1985.},

The samples were then analyzed to determine particle-size distribution, pH, organic carbon and five heavy metals. Within the study area, elevated levels of nickel, copper and iron were found with maximum total concentrations of 1.2, 0.97 and 20.0%, respectively. Manganese and zinc did not occur in above-normal concentrations. The pH values of the soils were depressed with levels as low as 2.4. Near the smelter, erosion from soils on slopes has transferred materials into lower lying areas, thereby rearranging the areal distribution of nickel, copper and iron. Although the surface soil horizons along the entire transect have above-normal concentrations of these elements, only within the eroded area is there marked variability in their vertical distribution. © 1984.},

abstract={We took samples of six surface soils, two subsurface soils, and one organic soil from the Menomonee River Watershed, Wisconsin, and dispersed them by (1) shaking with water to simulate natural water erosion and particle transport conditions, and (2) ultrasound to provide complete dispersion. The shaking treatment consists of end-over-end agitation of a 1:10 wt:vol soil:water mixture for 0.5 to 128 hours, and the ultrasound treatment was for a 15-minute period. The ratio of the amount of clay-sized particles dislodged by shaking to the amount of clay-sized particles obtained by ultrasound treatment was used to measure ease of dispersibility of soils. Samples with clay-sized particles that disperse readily under the shaking treatment have a higher dispersibility ratio than samples with clay-sized particles that remain intact as aggregates. If a 4-hour shaking treatment simulates the onset of soil erosion conditions in the field, as much as 90 percent of the primary clay-sized particles remain intact as silt-sized or larger aggregates. The clay dispersibility ratio was significantly correlated with organic carbon content in an inverse relationship. We also investigated the logarithmic and linear relationships. © 1983 The Williams & Wilkins Co.},

abstract={One-dimensional consolidation tests were performed on eight near-surface samples (0.5 to 3.5 m) from the Peru-Chile continental margin. These tests show that the consolidation behavior of these deposits is strongly influenced by the presence of high concentrations of organic matter resulting from the occurrence of coastal upwelling along this margin of South America. Organic carbon concentrations as high as 12% are found in samples from an upper slope mud lens between 10.5° to 13.6°S that lies beneath an area of intense upwelling. With increasing organic content both the compressibility and rate of secondary compression are found to increase. The increase in void ratio with increasing organic content and the ease by which organic matter is deformed appear responsible for these trends. Outside the mud lens the compressibility also increases as a result of increasing concentrations of clay-size material and the abundance of smectite and illite. All of the sediments along the margin behave as if they were consolidated under a pressure greater than the present effective overburden pressure. Evidence of erosion as a cause of the overconsolidation is present only on the upper slope mud lens at 13.6°S where 14C dating verifies the erosion of 3.5 to 7 m of sediment. Numerous unconformities and intervals of deformed bedding in a core from 13.6°S attest to the past instability of sediments at this site. At the other locations along the margin the increase in the overconsolidation ratio with increasing organic carbon content suggests that the bonding of sediment particles by organic matter may be responsible for the apparent overconsolidation. Low sedimentation rates on the slope off northern Chile may also be a contributing factor to the apparent overconsolidation of sediments in this area. © 1982.},

abstract={The levels and turnover of nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur in the herbage layer: litter and soil of three central Australian plant communities were investigated, following several years of above-average rainfall, and the possibility of a relationship between nutrient levels and range condition assessment was examined. There were only a few positive correlations between range condition and phosphorus levels, and they were not associated with the susceptibility of different soils to erosional losses. There were no positive correlations between range condition and the levels of either nitrogen or sulfur. The herbage and litter layers together, of the three plant communities, contained 30-72 kg ha-1 of total nitrogen, 4 kg ha-1 of total phosphorus and 4-7 kg ha-1 of total sulfur. These quantities were comparable to those of arid regions in other parts of the world, but the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur in soils, estimated by incubation or extraction to be available to plants, were comparatively low. Incubated nitrogen in the 0-10 cm depth of soils was 9-14 ppm and extractable phosphorus was 3-1 1 ppm. The 0-4 cm depth of soil contained 0.5-3 ppm extractable sulfur, and concentrations decreased with depth. Total soil nitrogen was lower than that in other arid regions whereas the amount of organic carbon in soil was comparable, so that C: N was relatively high. Substantial withdrawal of nutrients from senescing plant parts and rapid cycling of nutrients through litter appeared to be responsible for maintaining the level of nutrients in the herbage layer. © 1981 CSIRO.

abstract={Sediment and soil samples were collected along three transects located in a subartic salt marsh at North Point on the southwest coast of James Bay, Ont. Canada. Samples were analysed for major elements (Ti, Mg, Ca, K, Na, Fe, Mn, Si, Al, P and S) and trace metals (Cu, Pb, Ni, Co, Cd, Cr, Hg and Zn). In addition, inorganic and organic carbon, clay mineralogy, and particle size were determined. Results were subjected to a geological factor-analysis program. In general, the elemental composition of sediments reflected the contributions from major sources of bedrock in the area, Paleozoic carbonates, and Canadian Shield igneous and metamorphic rocks. Important factors controlling elemental composition appear to be: (1) the composition of parent material, (2) chemical/physical changes which occur during erosion and transportation, and (3) chemical/physical changes which occur in situ, either during sedimentation or diagenesis. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper describes laboratory testing of 148 samples collected from southern Alberta for erosion by wash and splash. Rainfal intensity was held constant during these tests. Soil aggregation was the most significant variable explaining soil loss. The significance of other soil properties, such as organic carbon and clay content is variable, depending on the interrelationships among aggregate stability, organic content, and clay content of particular soils. Variations of erodibility of the major soils examined are explained by the resistance of aggregates to compaction and dispersion. Splash detachment and wash transport are the dominant erosion mechanisms in inter-rill areas.-Author},

abstract={Vegetation and soils were sampled along a 1100m transect on a bajada in southern New Mexico to determine if present vegetation patterns can be interpreted from soil patterns. The plots were clustered into 4 communities: Erioneuron pulchellum desert grassland transition, Larrea tridentata desert shrub, Bouteloua curtipendula semidesert grassland and Bouteloua eriopoda desert grassland. Soils of these communities differ significantly in pH, Mg, organic carbon and total nitrogen. Soil series and geomorphic surface patterns, which are not readily affected by recent vegetation changes, suggest that Larrea may always have been an important shrub on shallow calcareous soils (of erosional surfaces) in southern New Mexico. Its importance as a mosaic type in the once extensive desert grasslands has probably been underestimated.-from Authors},

abstract={The impacts of off-road vehicles on vegetation and soil were investigated at seven representative sites in the San Francisco Bay area. Plant cover of grass and chaparral (with shrubs to 4 m tall) have been stripped by the two- and four-wheel vehicles in use. Impacts on loamy soils include increased surface strength (as much as 275 bars), increased bulk density (averaging 18%) to depths of 90 cm or more, reduction of soil moisture by an average 43% to 30 cm depths, greatly reduced infiltration, extension of the diurnal temperature range by as much as 12°C, and reduction of organic carbon by an average 33% in exposed soils. Very sandy soils respond similarly to vehicular use except that moisture is increased and surface strength of beach sand is decreased. These physical and chemical impacts reduce the land's capability of restoring its vegetative cover, which in turn adversely affects animal populations. Both the loss of plant cover and the physical changes caused by vehicles promote erosion. Measured soil and substrate losses from vehicular use zones range from 7 to 1180 kg/m2. The estimated erosion rate of the Chabot Park site exceeds the rate of erosion considered a serious problem by a factor 30, it exceeds United States Soil Conservation Service tolerance values by a factor of 46, and it exceeds average San Francisco Bay area erosion rates by a factor of 17. The resulting soil losses are effectively permanent. Neither the increased sediment yield nor the increased runoff is accomodated on the sites of use, and both are causing adverse effects to neighboring properties. © 1978 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract={The distribution and nature of the As‐bearing components of the sediments of selected fresh water lakes in Saskatchewan, Canada, were studied. The total As contents ranged from 2.7 to 13.2 ppm As and were found to be present in both colloidal and non‐colloidal fractions of the lake sediments. The proportion of the As bound to carbonates, organic matter and sesquioxides accounted for 12 to 74% of the total As of the sediments. The remaining As was apparently associated with apatite and silicates. The data indicate that the bulk of As in the lake sediments resides in sesquioxidic components and apatite. The release of As from the lake sediments would thus be affected by the stability of these As‐bearing components in a series of particle size fractions. Furthermore, based on information on the geographical distribution of As in the lake sediments, land erosion and agricultural runoff appear to be contributing significantly to the As concentration in lake sediments. It is thus suggested that close attention should be paid to land management and soil conservation to prevent further enrichment of As in lake sediments and to curtail the subsequent As contamination of the food chain.

Simulated rainfall amount was held constant for these tests Of all the factors examined, simulated vegetative cover was found to be most significant. When cover was held constant, soil aggregate stability is the best predictor of variations of soil erodibility. Organic carbon content, texture and runoff amount (infiltration capacity) are other significant variables Slope was found to be significantly related to wash loss but not splash loss Two factors were proposed to explain the lack of relationship between splash loss and slope: (a) the proportion of splashed particles collected outside the sample plan may vary with the size of the pan; (b) soil transportability by splash increases only slightly with slope angle and therefore splash loss is only marginally related to slope steepness. © 1976.},

abstract={Analysis of soil profiles and shallow ground water in the Susquehanna River basin, northeastern U.S.A., indicates that the atmospheric flux of 210Pb is efficiently scavenged by the organic-rich horizons of the soils. This atmospherically supplied 210Pb in soil profiles can only be lost from the system by soil erosion. Based on the annual sediment yield of the Susquehanna River and the excess 210Pb concentration in particulate matter, a mean residence time of 2000 yr is calculated for metals similar to Pb in soil profiles. The West Branch of the Susquehanna River (WBSR) is strongly affected by acid mine drainage and is low in pH and high in dissolved ( &lt;0.4 μm) 210Pb, Fe and Mn. Along its course iron hydroxide is precipitating at a pH of between 4 and 4.5 and the 210Pb supplied by the acid mine water is diminished by about 25% as a result of dilution. As the WBSR enters the Valley and Ridge Province of the Appalachians it has a 210Pb concentration of ~ 0.2 dpm/l. At this juncture it receives a considerable influx of alkalinity from tributaries draining carbonate terranes, resulting in neutralization of the sulfuric acid and increase of the river pH to around 6.5-7. This pH adjustment is accompanied by the precipitation of Fe and Mn. Due to the slow rate of Mn removal from solution, the Mn precipitation extends a considerable distance down river from the point of acid neutralization. Analyses for 210Pb in the river at points in or below the region of Mn precipitation show that 210Pb is rapidly scavenged from solution onto suspended particles. From the data it is possible to calculate the removal rate of Pb from water in the presence of Fe and Mn hydroxides and other particles. At a pH of 4-4.5 Pb removal is nonexistent relative to the river flow rate, but at a pH of 6.5-7 the 210Pb data indicate a residence time of &lt;0.7 day for dissolved Pb. © 1977.},

abstract={Soil-derived aerosol was collected at 3.5 m during a spring dust storm in the southern high plains of Texas. This aerosol, together with a sample of the soil from which it was derived, was size fractionated using sonically agitated microsieves, and the percent of organic content of each fraction was determined by a method involving autoclave oxidation and measurement of the CO2produced. It was found that the mass distribution of the aerosol exhibited the expected shift towards smaller sizes and that the percent of organic carbon increased in all size ranges, although particularly in the 10–100μm size range. An overall enrichment of ×20 in the organic content of the aerosol with respect to the present soil was determined. Microscopic examination of the aerosol fractions showed the presence of vegetative residual material typically with elongated dimensions and of low density. © 1976 The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.},

abstract={Nutrient element losses in runoff and eroded sediments were monitored during 1972 on different slopes and under different soil and crop management treatments. The experiments were conducted on 25 × 4 m field runoff plots, established on natural slopes of 1, 5, 10 and 15%. The soil and crop management treatments consisted of bare fallow (plowed), maize-maize (plowed and mulched), maize-maize (plowed), maize-cowpeas (no-till), and cowpeas-maize (plowed). Total loss of nutrient elements in runoff and eroded soil materials was significantly affected by slope and by soil and crop management treatments. Total annual nutrient element losses in runoff were 55 kg/ha for bare-fallow, 17 kg/ha for maize-maize (plowed), 12 kg/ha for cowpeas-maize (plowed), 2.3 kg/ha for maize-maize (plowed and mulched) and 4.3 kg/ha for maize-cowpeas (no-till). The concentration of nitrate in seepage water was two or three times higher than in surface water. Nutrient losses in eroded soil materials from the mulched and no-till treatments were negligible. From the plowed treatments, greatest losses were of organic matter and total nitrogen. The enrichment ratios were 2.4 times for organic carbon, 1.6 times for N, and 5.8 times for available phosphorus. © 1976.},

abstract={The South Dakota Cooperative Fishery Unit recently completed a study of the nutrient sources and transport in the Big Sioux River. Five contributing drainage areas, which were primarily agricultural, and 2 municipalities, Watertown and Brookings, were measured. Nutrients considered were organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The total organic forms of each are discussed and data on the nutrient contents of the 5 drainages contributing to the Big Sioux River from November 1971 to October 1972 inclusive are tabulated. Each of the areas is primarily agricultural and all had similar land use. Nutrient losses from land areas were most closely related to water discharge; discharge of nutrients and the discharge of water followed nearly identical patterns. The need to prevent surface runoff and soil erosion, and provide tertiary treatment of municipal sewage wastes is explained and several other remedial steps are discussed.},

abstract={The present-day salt-marsh estuaries of Georgia are shallow-water bodies having expanses of intertidal realms as the result of a relatively large tidal range of 2 m. Three characteristic macro-invertebrate assemblages are distinguished in the intertidal realms: (1) an assemblage of vagrant benthos including numerous different clams and snails lives in and upon the sediments of the lower intertidal to shallow subtidal zone; (2) the oyster biocoenosis consists chiefly of sessile benthos associated with colonies of Crassostrea virginica in the lower intertidal zone; (3) the tidal-marsh assemblage is confined to grassy marshes of the higher intertidal zone; molluscs are represented by Littorina irrorata and Modiolus demissus. Processes of sedimentation dominate over erosional processes in the estuaries. Detrital sand, silt and clay, together with organic debris and skeletal carbonates, contribute to the accumulations. Destruction of shell remains is promoted by marine borers, particularly Cliona, and by chemical leaching. Especially in tidal-marsh soils shells are subject to dissolution unless they are buried rapidly. In a marsh sediment calcitic concretions were found, which formed around severely leached shell remains. Where shells within a reduced sediment are leached, the local rise in pH often promotes precipitation of iron monosulfide, which eventually is converted into pyrite. Once included in fine-grained sediments, however, shells have a good chance of becoming preserved, especially if they are thick and consist of calcite rather than aragonite. Oyster shells are thus particularly durable. Because of their local abundance, oysters yield sizable shell deposits, including reefs, reworked deposits, and cheniers. Reworked accumulations of considerable extent occur in intertidal and shallow subtidal realms, usually in the vicinity of major tidal inlets. The accumulations, which form lenticular bodies of varying lateral extent, are interbedded with detrital sediments. The matrix of the shell concentrates is generally muddy, but can also be sandy or conglomeratic. Oyster beds of Late Pleistocene and mid-Tertiary ages in Georgia are similar to the recent ones. © 1972.},

abstract={In this paper, the results of examination on the relationships between soil erosion and the properties of forest soil with a laboratory rainfall simulator are reported. The soils examined were derived from the Tertiary tuff in Uzen-Ōyama, Yamagata Prefecture, sampled carefully not to disturb the natural structure, and kept in air-dried or saturated conditions before the examination. 1) The relationship between the amount of eroded material and the duration of rainfall was satisfactorily described by equation of the type E = atb (0&lt;b&lt;1) where E: Amount of eroded material, as percentage by weight on original soil t: Duration of rainfall a, b: Constant. 2) E30, eroded material (percentage) in 30 minutes, increased lineally as the volume weight of the fresh soil increased. 3) E30 decreased lineally on double-logarithmic graph as the organic carbon content of fine soil increased. 4) E30 decreased lineally on double-logarithmic graph as the amount of root in soil coreincreased. 5) E30 decreased lineally as the moisture equivalent of fine soil increased. 6) E30 increased lineally with the increase of dispersion ratio. 7) In each of the regression equations of E30 on the above-mentioned soil properties, the absolute value of the regression coefficient of the air-dried sample was larger significantly than that of the saturated sample. 8) Determination of the ratio of gravel content in eroded soil to that in remaining soil in air-dried samples indicated that in the erosive soil the eroded material contains much fine soil, and remaining material much gravel, compared with the resistive soil. © 1968, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

abstract={Soils of the Maracas series from two sites in the Northern Range of Trinidad differ only in minor aspects. With the exception of cheluviation of iron and formation of goethite the soils preserve the mineralogy and to some extent the structure of the parent phyllite. Weathering of calcic and sodic plagioclases is rapid. Mica is well preserved even in surface horizons and resists physical weathering, but when reduced to clay‐size, it weathers rapidly to kaolinite throughout the solum with little accumulation of expandable minerals. Exchangeable K is very low in spite of the micaceous nature of the soil parent material. Low levels of availability of Ca, Mg, and particularly P are also characteristic of these soils. Total inorganic P is very low, the main fraction being reductant‐soluble iron phosphate; other forms of inorganic P are unimportant. Organic P, derived from the carbonaceous matter of the parent rock, increases with depth. From the results obtained, the Maracas series may be classified as a latosol. For these soils located in a humid tropical environment, the paradoxical situation exists that they do not undergo sufficient weathering to release and make available plant nutrients before the solum is carried downslope by erosional processes. As a result, they are relatively infertile. Copyright © 1968, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={In summary, therefore, the writers theory is that the highly alkalic-feldspathic Piedmont area had a dense vegetable covering, and the growth and decay of the plants furnished organic and carbonic acids which leached the iron from the rocks, thus producing a white, argillaceous residual soil. Upon subsequent uplift and erosion the white residuum was carried to the sea and deposited at the mouths of the streams where the clayey matter was coagulated by the salts of the sea water and deposited in the quieter, deeper waters and in the undisturbed areas between deltas. Continuous, relatively rapid deposition of the clays gave the massive lenticular beds. Shifting currents produced the local unconformities and abundance of cross-bedding in the sands. Later uplift and consequent changes in climate and abundance of vegetation prohibited complete leaching. The residual material was eroded and deposited as ferruginous beds overlying the Cretaceous white sands and clays. The writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to Dr. Stephen Taber of the University of South Carolina, who suggested the problem, and to Drs. H. Ries and C. M. Nevin of Cornell University, whose suggestions and criticisms of this paper were very helpful. © 1927 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.},
