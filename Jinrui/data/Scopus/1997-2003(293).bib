abstract={Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key component of soil that greatly influences its structure and productivity, as well as aggregate stability. High soil aggregate stability translates to less soil erosion and hence lessens the likelihood of non-point-source water pollution. Repeated evidences of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increasing soil aggregate stability led to the rather accidental discovery of a soil protein called glomalin produced in abundance by the hyphae of these fungi. In the course of time, glomalin detaches from the hyphae, moves into the soil, and becomes a distinct componet of the SOM. Although the structure of glomalin remains unknown to date, research has revealed that it may comprise as much as 2% of soil by weight and 30% of soil carbon. Compared to glomalin, the traditional components of SOM, humic and fulvic acids, typically average 0.1% by soil weight and 5-10% of soil carbon. Glomalin is uncommonly tough and acts as a glue to hold the soil particles together. Studies on soils from differing locations and management practices have demonstrated the overall abundance and uncommonly high stability of glomalin, as well as an overwhelming positive correlation between glomalin content and soil agregation. Research has also identified the potential for glomalin in the role of carbon sequestration. Despite the significant amount of research that has been performed on glomalin in soils since its discovery in 1996, there is still a world of unknowns about this unique soil protein. Determining the structure of glomalin, as well as those environmental conditions that drive its presence in soils, will govern the future direction of glomalin research. © 2003.

abstract={The dynamics of organic carbon in 3 soils of China Loess Plateau and Canada Prairies was significantly different: in China, the Huangmian soil (Calcaric Cambisols, FAO) lost 77% of total organic carbon (0-20 cm) within 5 years of cultivation, with a decrease rate of 2.11 tons C·hm-2·yr-1, which was mainly caused by water erosion and tillage erosion; and the Huihe soil (haplic greyxems, FAO) lost 70% of total organic carbon (0-20 cm layer) at the rate of 0.961.06 tons C·hm-2·yr-1, because of water erosion and decomposition over 42 years. However, the orthic brown chernozem in Canada lost 11% and 44% of the total soil organic carbon (0-20 cm layer) after 40 and 80 years of cultivation, respectively, with a corresponding rate of 0.17 tons C hm-2·yr-1 and 0.45 tons C hm-2·yr-1. The improvement in tillage and rotation system, which prevented soil from wind erosion and increased current residues into soil, was responsible for the decrease of the loss rate. The dynamics of soil light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) was similar to that of total organic carbon: Huangmian and Heilu soil lost 73% and 90% of LFOC, while orthic brown chernozem lost 74% and 70% of LFOC after breaked in 1920 and 1960, respectively. Among the test soils, Huangmian and Huihe soil had the fast SOC depletion due to the difference in the allocation of organic carbon between LFOC and HFOC.},

abstract={The brown mountain carbonate soils covering the "yadiere" (hills) in the Gissarska valley of Tadzhikistan have relatively high humus portions. The humus content in the upper layers of sedentary soils was found to range from 2.70 to 3.18 per cent. However, in eroded soils the humus content declines from 1.35-0.83 per cent to levels as low as 0.57-0.75 per cent. The decrease of humus substances in erodible soils is mainly dependent on their slope exposure. Soils on sites sloping to north revealed the highest humus content whilst soils on east and west slopes and, in particular, on south slopes were found to have the lowest humus content. Sprinkler irrigation applied to soils on sloping sites, following grass seeding, was found to result in swift growth and in the evolution of a natural flora what, in turn, induced intensive humus build-up. The humus content of the covering layer increased by 0.98 per cent, that in eroded soils markedly less. The increased humus content primarily leads to humic acid enrichment, this effect causing a wider SGK:SFK ratio. Following grass seeding on these soils a marked increase in the content of dissolved and R 2O 3-bound humic acids can be observed.},

abstract={The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of erosion simulated by removal of surface soil layers and the effect of rainfall erosion on wheat and soybean productivity. Thickness of soil layers removed artificially to simulate erosion effects were 0 cm, 3 cm, 6 cm and 14 cm, representing the entire Ap horizon. Wheat productivity did not allow to establish any correlation with thickness of removed soil. The reduction of soybean productivity was 148 kg ha -1 and 105 kg ha -1 per cm of soil removed, in 0 to 6 cm and 0 to 14 cm layers, respectively. Cation exchange capacity and Ca+Mg content, in different soil depth, were the soil attributes that most influenced soybean productivity. Organic carbon content was the only soil attribute to correlate with soybean and wheat yields, in both, rainfall and simulated erosion conditions. Simulation of erosion effect on soybean yield by removal of different soil surface layers can be used, once the difference on soybean productivity compared to the same soil layer lost by natural erosion was less than 6%.},

abstract={Acid soils play an important role in the production of world food and fiber. The majority of acid soils in the tropical and subtropical regions are highly weathered, subject to intensive cropping, and vulnerable to soil erosion. Degradation of these soils poses a great challenge to sustainable agriculture in these regions. An efficient indexing system using minimal physical, chemical, and biological parameters is immediately needed to assess and monitor the dynamics of soil quality under diversified farming systems and to improve agricultural practices and productivity. Various physical, chemical, and biological properties can be used to characterize soil quality. However, the number, activity, and diversity of microorganisms and the related biochemical processes are the most important components of soil quality, especially for the highly weathered acid soils, in which plant productivity is closely related to biological cycling. Several microbiological and biochemical parameters have been suggested as indicators of soil quality. They include: microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), nitrogen (Nmic), and phosphorus (Pmic) and their turnover rates; the microbial quotient (MQ) (Cmic/organic C ratio); basal respiration (qCO2); the microbial metabolic quotient (MMQ) (qCO2/Cmic); the ratio of microbial N over total Kjeldahl N; and enzyme activity. Recently, microbial diversity parameters such as community level physiological profile, phospholipid fatty acids, the ratio of Gram-negative/Gram-positive bacteria, the ratio of fungal/bacterial microorganisms, and free-living diazotrophic bacteria, etc., have been identified as important indicators of soil quality. All these microbiological and biochemical parameters have been shown to relate to soil productivity and respond to changes of land use, vegetation coverage, agricultural practices such as liming, fertilization, and tillage, as well as climate factors (temperature and rainfall). Current progress on measurement, interpretation, and potential application of the microbiological and biochemical indices in assessing quality, fertility, and sustainability of highly weathered acid soils are reviewed in this chapter. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The research was accomplished in the Caetés watershed, municipal district of Paty do Alferes (RJ), from January to March of 1997, in the crop cycle of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). The research took place in an area of Yellow-Red Podzolic soil (Udult), of clayey texture, at a slope of 60%, where Wischmeier plots for studying soil erosion were installed. The treatments applied were: (a) MAQ - down hill mechanical tillage, and burning of crop residues; (b) MANQ - contour mechanical tillage, with plant residues remaining on the field; (c) AA - contour tillage, with animal traction and strips of grasses placed every 7,0 m; and (d) CM - minimum tillage. Soil samples were collected in crop rows, and planting pits, in the plow layer, before planting and after harvesting. After each rain that resulted in production of sediments, the material was collected, dried, weighed, and kept for analyzes of total P; labile, organic and inorganic P; organic carbon; and pH in water. The CM treatment reduced P losses and influenced the distribution of labile and organic forms of P. MAQ treatment implied in loss of 12.4% of the total applied P, while the CM lost only 1%. The remaining of the plant residues among the crop rows, on the MANQ plot, decreased in 40% the total P loss, when compared to MAQ. The plots MAQ and MANQ showed clay increase in the sediments, which favored the highest losses of P sorbed in the clay fraction.},

abstract={Wind-erodible soil sediments are classified as aggregates and particles &lt; 1 mm in diameter. Aggregate size has been reported to influence pesticide retention and behavior in the soil. Atrazine Sorption and desorption isotherms were determined using batch equilibration methods for six aggregate sizes of Barnes loam (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplodol) and Brandt silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplodol) soils. Aggregate and particle sizes used in this study ranged from &lt; 0.11 to &gt; 1.7 mm, and atrazine concentrations ranged from 0.65 to 39.2 L-1. The Kf-values for the isotherms were calculated using the Freundlich equation. In the Barnes loam, Kf-values were strongly positively correlated to aggregate size, particle size, and organic carbon (OC) content (P = 0.01 for each parameter), whereas in the Brandt silty clay loam, K f-values were less correlated to size and OC content (P ≥ 0.1) but were better correlated to clay content and estimated specific surface area (P = 0.05 for each parameter). Desorption was hysteretic with about 18% more atrazine desorbed from smallest than from largest size fractions. At a concentration of 13.0 μmol L-1, the amount desorbed ranged from 9 to 13.7% of the initial amount of adsorbed atrazine after 5 d, whereas at 39.2 μmol L-1, the amount desorbed ranged from 10.3 to 16% of the amount adsorbed. These data indicate that wind-erodible size aggregates and particles could be a source of herbicide contamination of surface water.},

abstract={Late Quaternary sections (1.2 Ma) of ODP-Site 1075 from the Congo deep-sea fan are investigated to reconstruct variations of terrigenous organic matter supply to the eastern equatorial Atlantic. To characterize the organic matter (OM) with regard to marine and terrigenous amounts we used elemental analysis (C, N, S), stable carbon isotopes (bulk δ13Corg), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and terrigenous biomarkers (lignin phenols from CuO oxidation). The records of total organic carbon (TOC) contents, C org/Ntot ratios, bulk OM degradation rates (C org/Corg*), and the ratios of hydrocarbons (HC) from low-mature versus HC from high-mature OM (lm/hm) reveal pronounced cyclic changes in OM abundance, preservation, and reactivity that are closely related to the precessional controlled record of insolation, and thus, to variations in upwelling intensity and fluvial run-off. Primary productivity off the Congo is stimulated by both, enhanced nutrient supply in response to trade-induced upwelling during arid African climates (insolation minima) and fluvial nutrient delivery during humid stages (following insolation maxima), especially due to the contribution of dissolved silica that is taken up preferably by diatoms. However, results stemming from a multiparameter approach reveal that the fluvial supply of degraded OM and black carbon (BC) associated with fine-grained sediments from soil erosion is a decisive factor for the preservation of marine OM and, in addition, significantly influences the geochemical signature of bulk and terrigenous OM. Riverine and eolian supply of C4 plant matter, as well as enhanced concentrations of BC, during arid and arid-to-humid transitional climate stages, may lead to a severe underestimation of terrigenous organic carbon, if its amount is calculated from bulk isotopic ratios using binary end-member models. During the humid stages, it is the massive supply of 13C-enriched soil OM with low Corg/Ntot ratios that may suggest a mainly marine composition of bulk OM. In fact, terrigenous OM governs bulk OM geochemical signatures in the sediments of the Congo deep-sea fan, a result that is contradictory to earlier studies, especially to the conventional interpretation of the bulk δ13Corg signal. © 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract={Chinese loess-palaeosol sequences are well known for their records of monsoonal climatic variations. However, the modern processes of dust accumulation and soil formation remain poorly understood. A high-resolution investigation on modern soils, including the measurement of magnetic susceptibility, particle-size distribution, total Fe, total organic carbon, CaCO3 content, and optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was carried out on the Zhouyuan loess tableland in the southern Loess Plateau. The results indicate that modern cinnamon soils (luvisols) have developed on contemporarily accumulated aeolian dust during the Holocene. The aeolian loess accumulated during the Younger Dryas was identified in the top part of the Malan Loess that underlay the modern soil by OSL dating and proxy climatic data. It indicates that the Malan Loess accumulated during the last glaciation (marine isotope stages 2-4) does not serve as the parent material for the modern soils. Pedogenesis of the soils started with the increased precipitation and soil moisture that have occured on the loess tableland since the early Holocene. Precipitation-driven pedogenesis and organic activities are responsible for the leaching of CaCO3, decomposition of mineral dust and the production of clay and ferromagnetic minerals. Drier intervals have interrupted soil formation several times, and therefore profiles with multiple soils have been developed at many sites on the loess tableland. At places where soil erosion was relatively strong, either a single soil or welded soils are preserved in the Holocene profiles. This does not necessarily mean, however, that modern soils over the plateau have been developed without interruption under a constantly warmer, moister climate. This is significant for understanding the surface processes and climatic variation during the formation of the numerous palaeosols over the Loess Plateau in the Quaternary. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The paper summarizes results of investigations done in 1999-2000 by 'several authors in Wielkopolska region, (western Poland) near Turew in young midfield shelterbelts and adjacent cereal felds. It was found that the soil organic matter content, as well as microbial and faunal biomass decrease gradually from the shelterbelt toward the field centre. The annual increase of carbon was assessed and possible sources of it (wind erosion, leaf fall, input of invertebrate faeces) considered. The results suggest, that excreta contribute significantly to total carbon input. The shelterbelts influence the biomass, density and composition of many soil and above-ground invertebrate taxa and individual size of animals occurring in bordering fields.},

abstract={In the central highlands of Mexico, mesquite (Prosopis spp) and huisache (Acacia tortuoso), N2 fixing trees or shrubs, dominate the vegetation and are used in an alley cropping system to prevent erosion and restore soil fertility. We investigated how much the leaves of both trees contribute to dynamics of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil by adding leaves of both species to soil sampled under the canopy of mesquite and huisache, outside their canopy and from fields cultivated with maize at three different sites and monitoring microbial biomass C, production of carbon dioxide (CO 2), and dynamics of inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) in an aerobic incubation. The soluble fraction and N content of the mesquite leaves were larger than in the huisache leaves, but lignin and polyphenol content were lower. Evolution of CO2 increased 2.7-times when mesquite and 2.4-times when huisache leaves were added to soil. During all stages of decomposition and in all treatments, C mineralization of leaves from mesquite was greater than from huisache leaves. Mesquite leaves induced an increase in mineral N of 25.6 mg N kg-1 soil after 56 days and those of huisache 9.8 mg N kg-1. Twenty-six percent of N from mesquite leaves and 11% of huisache was mineralized, if no priming effect was considered. Nitrogen release from the leaves was greater when the soil organic matter content was lower. It was found that soil under the canopy of mesquite and huisache effectively accumulated organic material, micro-organisms and valuable nutrients. In an alley cropping system huisache might be a better choice than mesquite as huisache grows faster than mesquite and sheds its leaves twice a year while mesquite only once, although the amount of N mineralized was larger from mesquite leaves than from those of huisache.},

abstract={The concentrations of beryllium (Be) in surface waters are presented for major water quality surveys of eastern UK rivers, based on extensive work within a major environmental programme, the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS). Two measurements were made, one for dissolved Be (i.e. the fraction that can pass through 0.45-μm membrane filters) the other for acid available total Be (dissolved Be plus the fraction of particulate Be that can be leached by a 1% v/v concentrated nitric acid solution). Dissolved Be concentrations are generally less than 1 μgl-1 with a mean of approximately 0.02 μgl-1, but higher values occur across the eastern UK rivers between 16th October and 7th November 1995 under neutral to alkaline conditions where Be would not be expected to be mobile. The higher values vary from river to river and there is a marked increase from north to south with particularly high concentrations (up to 29 μgl-1) for the industrial and urban impacted rivers of the southern Humber basin. The results show a major increase in dissolved Be at a time of exceptional drought conditions and climate instability, which seems to be linked to industrial/urban catchment systems. The average dissolved Be flux is 0.22 gha-1year-1 with a range in mean across the sites of 0.08-0.45 gha-1year-1. Without the period of enhanced Be concentrations, the Be flux through the period would have been approximately 40% less. There is no clear distinction between the dissolved Be flux for the rural and urban/industrial catchment systems. Acid available particulate Be (AAPBe) concentrations are low across the eastern UK rivers, they range between 0 and 1.33 μgl -1 with a mean of 0.02 μgl-1 and the highest concentrations occur for the industrial/urban rivers (approximately twice the levels occurring within the rural rivers). The AAPBe concentrations are linearly correlated with the concentrations of suspended sediment, particulate organic carbon, particulate nitrogen, particulate phosphorus, and the AAP for several transition metals (Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni and Y), and the lanthanides. This reflects the nature of the catchment sources of particulate material (soil erosion and pollutant sources) and the hydrogeochemistry of Be with the high potential for hydrolysis and hydrogen bonding due to its small atomic size and high surface charge density. The acid available particulate flux averages approximately 0.42 gha-1year-1 with a range in mean across the sites of 0.14-1.2 gha-1year-1. The highest flux occurs for a river with a flood plain contaminated by spoil from historic mining of lead-zinc deposits, but there is no clear separation between the rural and the industrial/urban impacted catchments. The results indicate a potential and most unexpected dissolved Be stress to lowland aquatic environments, a stress that might well increase over time for the UK given the increasing climate instability within the country. The findings are linked to other information on Be in surface waters for other UK surface waters, including previously unpublished data, to allow a broader perspective for UK riverine environments. Information is provided on Be levels in acidic upland streams in mid Wales (upper River Severn), other eastern UK rivers (collected towards the end of the LOIS initiative) and drainage waters from a disused tin wine in Cornwall (Wheal Jane Mine). © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The performance and development potential of seven trees, two grasses and five turf legumes were evaluated in three highly eroded landscapes of Puerto Rico. Species development during the first year of establishment was adequate at the Corozal site, intermediate in Vega Baja and poor at the Orocovis location. Tree species Albicia procera and Leucaena leucocephala K 636 grew particularly well at Corozal and Vega Baja. At the Corozal site, grasses and turf legumes were significantly better for reducing soil erosion than trees and bare ground. Brachiaria decumbens did not allow sediment losses during a highly rainy period at this locale; it was significantly (P < 0.01) superior to all tree species, one cover legume and bare ground. Soil dissolved organic carbon (SDOC) estimates were significantly (P < 0.01) higher for ground cover species than for tree species and bare ground. Soil chemical composition of all eroded soil sites under consideration did not explain the changes in performance and development of the evaluated germplasm.},

abstract={The Bocage in the western part of Europe is an ancient rural landscape characterized by a network of hedgerows. The system studied here consists of hedges growing on earth and stone banks, which are found in the Armorican Massif (western France). Seven sites were analysed, which represented a large, but not complete, set of situations. We investigated the influence of hedges parallel to contour lines on soil characteristics, soil profile morphology and carbon storage at the hillslope scale. The analysis is based on a morphological description of the soil catena from the top of the hill to downslope of the hedge, and on measurements of bulk density and organic carbon in different soil profiles on the slopes. The results show that thickness of the organic horizon increases slowly from the top of the hill as far as the hedge, whereas under the hedge the bulk density is low and the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage large. Two effects of the hedges on SOC storage are apparent, namely, a local effect under the hedge, due to tree activity, and an anti-erosive effect at the hillslope scale. A rough approximation based on these data assessed the fraction of SOC storage attributed to the hedge network of between 13 and 38% of the total carbon stock.},

abstract={Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical freshwater lake, is an important resource, ecologically and economically. THg distribution in the northern parts of the lake are not well known, so to answer this gap, patterns in total mercury (THg) in water, soil and two dated sediment cores from northern Lake Victoria were determined. Water THg concentrations ranged from 0. 7 to 5.8 ng/L, and there were no apparent differences observed between Napoleon and Winam Gulfs. Two precipitation samples had Hg concentrations of 7 and 31 ng/L. Surface soil samples collected from various agricultural sites around Jinja, Napoleon Gulf, have THg concentrations between 12.7 and 48.4 ng/g dry weight; they were correlated with organic carbon, total phosphorus and % clay. A near-shore core taken in Itome Bay in Napoleon Gulf, and an offshore core collected from the deepest part of the lake had similar THg concentrations and profiles (78 to 458 ng/g dry weight). The increase in THg concentration in the profiles of both cores began around 1960 and peaked around 1980. The similar sedimentary THg profiles and fluxes in the cores suggest that the THg sources to L. Victoria are primarily atmospheric, with some erosion inputs, and that equatorial African ecosystems are not exempt from the global increase in baseline THg concentrations.},

abstract={Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered to be key to sustainability of agriculture in the tropics. In southern Brazil, no-tillage has been adopted widely to control soil erosion, but its impact on the dynamics of SOM is not well established. We measured soil carbon (C) and δ13C in two crop rotations, one of which contained C4 maize (Zea mays L.), after 21 years of contrasting tillage (conventional tillage versus no-tillage). Adjacent sites that reflected historic land-uses were also sampled. In the tillage experiment there was no effect of tillage on the total amount of C in the 0-40 cm profile (even when contrasting bulk density was accounted for), and the concentration of C differed only in the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm layers. However, the occasional input of C4 material in the maize rotation resulted in a significant effect of rotation on δ13C (P &lt;0.001). Using 13C as a tracer for the SOM formed since the start of the experiment, we estimated the abundance of 'recent' and 'old' C within each depth interval. We found the main effect of tillage was to increase the medium-term turnover of SOM, particularly in the subsoil (i.e. below 20cm depth). Compared with no-tillage, there was almost five times more recent C in the subsoil, and 20% more recent C in the 0-40 cm profile as a whole.},

abstract={The chemical composition of riverine suspended sediment is the integration of the weathering crust minerals, soil organic matter and erosion agency within a specific drainage basin, which has been largely disturbed by the human activities. Selected metal elements of the riverine suspended sediment in the Zhujiang River were analysed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) in three different hydrological phases from 1997 to 1998 at Makou and Sanshui hydrographic gauge stations, located at the lower reaches of the two main tributaries of the Zhujiang River, i.e. the Xijiang and the Beijing Rivers respectively. Organic carbon and nitrogen were also analysed using a conventional element analyser. The results demonstrate that the chemical composition of the riverine suspended sediment show obvious variability in different hydrological phases, which closely correlate to the organic matter content in suspended sediment. Intensified erosion in the flood phase results in lower concentration of the organic matter than that in the lower water level phase. The riverine suspended sediment with rich organic matter in the lower water level phase adsorbs some metal elements from the river water. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In the past several decades, agricultural management practices consisting of intensive tillage and high rate of fertilization to improve crop yields have resulted in the degradation of soil and environmental qualities by increasing erosion and nutrient leaching in the groundwater and releasing greenhouses gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), that cause global warming in the atmosphere by oxidation of soil organic matter. Consequently, management practices that sustain crop yields and improve soil and environmental qualities are needed. This paper reviews the findings of the effects of tillage practices, cover crops, and nitrogen (N) fertilization rates on crop yields, soil organic carbon (C) and N concentrations, and nitrate (NO3)-N leaching from the soil. Studies indicate that conservation tillage, such as no-till or reduced till, can increase soil organic C and N concentrations at 0- to 20-cm depth by as much as 7-17% in 8 years compared with conventional tillage without significantly altering crop yields. Similarly, cover cropping and 80-180 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) fertilization can increase soil organic C and N concentrations by as much as 4-12% compared with no cover cropping or N fertilization by increasing plant biomass and amount of C and N inputs to the soil. Reduced till, cover cropping, and decreased rate of N fertilization can reduce soil N leaching compared with conventional till, no cover cropping, and full rate of N fertilization. Management practices consisting of combinations of conservation tillage, mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops, and reduced rate of N fertilization have the potentials for sustaining crop yields, increasing soil C and N storage, and reducing soil N leaching, thereby helping to improve soil and water qualities. Economical and social analyses of such practices are needed to find whether they are cost effective and acceptable to the farmers.},

abstract={One of the options for achieving an adequate food supply in tropical Africa is by bringing more land into production. This often requires clearing and developing new vegetation areas for agricultural production. In sub-Saharan Africa, large areas of forest are being cleared for cultivation without adequate knowledge as to the consequences of the clearing method employed. This study was therefore initiated to, among other objectives, assess the effects of some forest clearing methods on soil compaction, texture, and micronutrients. Treatments were the following five clearing methods: (1) mechanical (MC), (2) semi-mechanical (SMC), (3) slash and burn (manual) (SB), (4) mechanical - no planting (MCNP), and (5) slash and burn -no planting (SBNP). After clearing, we planted maize and cowpea in every other row during the first year, and planted maize and cassava during the second year in the plots of treatments 1-3. Changes in soil texture, bulk density, and exchangeable Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu were determined. Soil bulk density increased (with depth) in all treatments from the intitial (0-15cm) level of 1.1 g cm-3 to between 1.27 and 1.39 g cm-3 2 years after clearing, with the highest levels occurring in the MC plots. This indicated that clearing was accompanied by soil compaction. Some changes were noted in soil textural composition, but these were not of practical significance. Exchangeable Mn, Fe, and Cu (0-15 cm) decreased markedly after clearing, especially under MC in the first year. Zinc levels changed little during the study period. The decline in micronutrient levels was paralleled by a decline in soil organic carbon.},

abstract={We investigated the influence of agricultural management and various plant covers related to the period of abandonment on soil properties, erosion and nutrient depletion in a typical Mediterranean area with sandy loam shallow soils. Cultivated soils (CS) with insufficient management, 5 year abandoned soils covered with meadow (A5), 25 year abandoned soils covered with dense scrubs (A25), 50 year abandoned soils covered with cork trees (A50) and soils in a 50 year pine reforested area (P50) were studied over a period of 6 months (May-October 1999). The soils were classified as Lithic Xerorthents. Both the differences in soil properties and response to rainfall events were mainly attributed to the different vegetation types and stages in land management. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the results, by running the overall data determined after five rainfall events. The factors extracted by PCA of the samples by variables matrix represented the response of the environments to different rainfall intensities as a function of management or natural evolution after abandonment. CS environments showed the highest runoff and sediment yield as well as the highest amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen in runoff water. The sequence of abandonment (A5, A25 and A50) showed approximately the same runoff production, whereas eroded sediments (ES) and DOC were inversely correlated. Organic carbon in the ES and DOC in runoff water always increased with the period of abandonment, which accounted for consistent nutrient depletion. Nevertheless, the A50 environment (dominated by Quercus suber) showed the best soil properties, whilst the A25 environment with dense cover of Cistus monspeliensis and Calicotome espinosa seemed to cause a worsening effect on the soil's physical and chemical properties. This is probably because these environments are more severely damaged by wild fire occurrence. In terms of sediment yield, the P50 environment followed CS environment, indicating that reforestation followed by insufficient forest management may negatively affect both soil properties and response to the erosive action of rainfall. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Soils in the Mediterranean area are very prone to erosion due to the loss of organic matter and the consequent lack of protective vegetation. In this experiment a Mediterranean degraded soil with a 15% slope was amended at a rate of 250 t ha-1 wet weight with sewage sludge and with a mixture of sewage sludge and barley straw (70% carbon from sewage sludge and 30% from the straw) in order to study their influence on soil structure recovery and hence the soils's resistance to erosion processes. Both types of organic amendment led to an improvement in several soil properties (physical, biological, and microbiological) as a result of the spontaneous growth plant covering that became evident three months after amendment. This vegetation remained throughout the two years of the experiment and prevented the water erosion processes that normally precede soil degradation. Amendment by sewage sludge alone reduced soil loss by 80% compared with the control soil, while the mixture that included both sewage sludge and barley straw reduced losses by 84%, both reducing runoff by 57%. The amended soils showed increases in the percentage of stable aggregates, the levels of the total and water-soluble C fractions, microbial biomass C, basal respiration, and the activity of the different enzymes involved in the biogeochemical cycles of C, N, and P. The results confirm the usefulness of sewage sludge as an organic amendment for recovering damaged soils.},

abstract={Mini-watersheds called Nong in Thai are geographical components of rainfed lowland rice culture in Northeast Thailand, and constitute distinct units in understanding environmental constraints for low and unstable rainfed rice production there. The toposequential variation of soil fertility and its relation to rice productivity within mini-watersheds, was examined by phytometry of sampled soils and field measurements of rice growth and yield. The phytometry experiment with irrigated potted rice using soils sampled from various rice fields within each mini-watershed, revealed that soil fertility as evaluated by rice dry matter production showed a 5 times difference among the fields at most. The difference in the soil fertility was ascribed primarily to that in nitrogen (N) supply capacity, which itself had a strong correlation with soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Accordingly, the biomass production of pot-grown rice was proportional to SOC content, which suggested the usefulness of SOC as an index for soil fertility evaluation. The effect of clay on the soil fertility was much less than that of SOC. The actual rice yield in each field also showed quite large field-to-field variation, most of which was explained by the SOC content, rice growth duration and fertilizer application rate even though water availability also affected the yield. The yield positively correlated with growth duration and hence with earlier transplanting. Both SOC and clay contents of fields showed steep gradients with ascending field elevation within mini-watersheds, resulting in a marked toposequential distribution of rice yield. The toposequential distributions of SOC and clay contents imply that rice culture after deforestation accelerated soil erosion from upper to lower fields. The large toposequential gradient in soil fertility requires different resource and crop management for each toposequential position, in order to improve rice productivity of the mini-watershed as a whole.},

abstract={Soil erosion and deposition may play important roles in balancing the global atmospheric carbon budget through their impacts on the net exchange of carbon between terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere. Few models and studies have been designed to assess these impacts. In this study, we developed a general ecosystem model, Erosion-Deposition-Carbon-Model (EDCM), to dynamically simulate the influences of rainfall-induced soil erosion and deposition on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in soil profiles. EDCM was applied to several landscape positions in the Nelson Farm watershed in Mississippi, including ridge top (without erosion or deposition), eroding hillslopes, and depositional sites that had been converted from native forests to croplands in 1870. Erosion reduced the SOC storage at the eroding sites and deposition increased the SOC storage at the depositional areas compared with the site without erosion or deposition. Results indicated that soils were consistently carbon sources to the atmosphere at all landscape positions from 1870 to 1950, with lowest source strength at the eroding sites (13 to 24 gC m-2 yr-1), intermediate at the ridge top (34 gC m-2 yr-1), and highest at the depositional sites (42 to 49 gC m-2 yr-1). During this period, erosion reduced carbon emissions via dynamically replacing surface soil with subsurface soil that had lower SOC contents (quantity change) and higher passive SOC fractions (quality change). Soils at all landscape positions became carbon sinks from 1950 to 1997 due to changes in management practices (e.g., intensification of fertilization and crop genetic improvement). The sink strengths were highest at the eroding sites (42 to 44 gC m-2 yr-1 , intermediate at the ridge top (35 gC m-2 yr-1), and lowest at the depositional sites (26 to 29 gC m-2 yr-1). During this period, erosion enhanced carbon uptake at the eroding sites by continuously taking away a fraction of SOC that can be replenished with enhanced plant residue input. Overall, soil erosion and deposition reduced CO2 emissions from the soil into the atmosphere by exposing low carbon-bearing soil at eroding sites and by burying SOC at depositional sites. The results suggest that failing to account for the impact of soil erosion and deposition may potentially contribute to an overestimation of both the total historical carbon released from soils owing to land use change and the contemporary carbon sequestration rates at the eroding sites.},

abstract={The susceptibility of some Soils in the high rainfall zone of Nigeria to soil erosion must be measured regularly for better soil management. A number of techniques have been adopted for the determination of this soil loss parameter. The aim of this study is to determine the soil characteristics that relate significantly to erodibility. Soil samples collected from 0-20 cm depth from 10 different locations in the upper rainforest area were analysed for particle size distribution, water-stable aggregates, exchangeable cations, organic carbon, soil dispersion and aggregating indices. The soils are mainly Aerisols, Nitosols, Gleysols and Ferralsol in the FAO classification while their textures are sands to sandy-clay-loam. They are very unstable in water as reflected in the higher values of WSA &gt;0·50 mm and the mean-weight diameter that ranged from 0·50 to 2·03 mm. The dispersion ratio for the soils are between 0·26 and 0·69 while clay dispersion ratio also ranged from 0·24 to 0·80. Revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) erodibility model values (K were from 0·03 to 0·06 Mg h MJ-1 mm-1. These parameters can be effectively used in predicting soil erodibility, though their predictability varied in ranking of soil erodibility. In spite Of this variability these indices can be used for potential erosion hazard determination by agricultural extension staff to avoid crop failures and other negative influence of soil erosion. The soil parameters are easy to determine and will be a valuable instrument when faster approaches to erosion control measures are required. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 from 285 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in 1850 to 370 ppm in 2000 is attributed to emissions of 270 ± 30 Pg carbon (C) from fossil fuel combustion and 136 ± 55 Pg C by land-use change. Present levels of anthropogenic emissions involve 6·3 Pg C by fossil fuel emissions and 1·8 Pg C by land-use change. Out of the historic loss of terrestrial C pool of 136 ± 55 Pg, 78 ± 12 Pg is due to depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool comprising 26 ± 9 Pg due to accelerated soil erosion. A large proportion of the historic SOC lost can be resequestered by enhancing the SOC pool through converting to an appropriate land use and adopting recommended management practices (RMPs). The strategy is to return biomass to the soil in excess of the mineralization capacity through restoration of degraded/desertified soils and intensification of agricultural and forestry lands. Technological options for agricultural intensification include conservation tillage and residue mulching, integrated nutrient management, crop rotations involving cover crops, practices which enhance the efficiency of water, plant nutrients and energy use, improved pasture and tree species, controlled grazing, and judicious use of inptus. The potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 1-2 Pg C yr-1 for the world, 0·3-0·6 Pg C yr-1 for Asia, 0·2-0·5 Pg C yr-1 for Africa and 0·1-0·3 Pg C yr-1 for North and Central America and South America, 0·1-0·3 Pg C yr-1 for Europe and 0·1-0·2 Pg C yr-1 for Oceania. Soil C sequestration is a win-win strategy; it enhances productivity, improves environment moderation capacity, and mitigates global warming. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={We present a dataset including clay mineralogy, gamma-ray spectrometry, organic matter content and magnetic susceptibility of the Hettangian to lowest Sinemurian successions of Dorset and Somerset, southern UK (Blue Lias Formation, Bristol Channel and Wessex basins). In both areas, the clay assemblages comprise predominantly detrital illite, kaolinite and illite/smectite mixed layers. Clays probably originated from the erosion of the Hercynian massifs, the relative proportions of kaolinite and illite being modulated by arid-humid climatic fluctuations. The organic matter (OM) content (types II to IV) ranges up to 12% in both areas. A clear stratigraphical trend in clay mineral assemblages is apparent in Somerset, whereas in Dorset sharp contrasts between adjacent horizons and a greater dilution by carbonate mask the long-term evolution. Correlations between both areas based on similar vertical trends in clay mineral abundance support the suggestion of a hiatus within the angulata Zone of the Dorset succession. As expected, the kaolinite/illite ratio correlates with the Th/K ratio deduced from gamma-ray spectrometry. However, significant departures from the correlation occur in OM- rich intervals, suggesting that Th may be partly adsorbed on to OM particles. Surprisingly, high magnetic susceptibility correlates with abundant kaolinite, not with Fe-rich clays, indicating either that kaolinite is accompanied by a soil-inherited magnetisable phase (possibly iron oxide) or that illite-rich rocks are more strongly diluted by carbonate than are kaolinite-rich strata.},

abstract={The effect of 2 tillage practices (zero v. conventional), fertiliser application (nitrogen, phosphorus and zinc), and pulse-cereal rotation on changes in soil mineral nitrogen, plant-available water in the soil, grain yield and protein, and key soil fertility parameters (total nitrogen, organic carbon) in the Central Highlands of Queensland were examined between 1991 and 1998. Four pasture treatments (perennial legume, perennial grass, annual legume and legume-grass mixes) were included in January 1995, following previously unsuccessful attempts to grow lucerne and annual medics. The experiment was conducted as an opportunity cropping system on an open downs soil at Gindie that is representative of a large proportion (70%) of soils in the Central Highlands. Tillage practice did not affect the amount of mineral nitrate or the plant-available water content of the soil at planting, except in 1991 and 1998 when plant-available water content was higher under conventional tillage than zero tillage. However, zero tillage improved grain yield in 2 of 4 years (wheat in 1992; sorghum in 1996), increased uptake of nitrogen in every crop and produced greater grain protein levels in both wheat crops grown than conventional tillage. There were grain responses to nitrogen + phosphorus fertilisers (wheat in 1991 and sorghum in 1997). Grain protein was increased with applications of nitrogen regardless of whether phosphorus was added in 3 of the 4 crops planted. Sowing a pulse did not significantly increase grain yields in the following crop although it did increase soil mineral nitrogen at planting. Soil nitrate remained low in control (P0N0) plots (&lt;39 kg N/ha) when crops were planted each year but increased significantly (average 84 kg N/ha) following a long fallow of 3.5 years resulting from drought. Plant-available water content of the soil at sowing was lower where chickpeas had been grown the previous season than with wheat. Neither tillage practice nor fertiliser application affected soil organic carbon or soil total nitrogen concentrations in the topsoil. However, all pasture treatments improved soil total nitrogen compared with continuous cropping, and with the exception of annual pasture legumes, also improved soil organic carbon after only 2 seasons. Largest improvements in soil fertility (total nitrogen and organic carbon) occurred with perennial species. It was concluded that zero tillage practices can have beneficial impacts on grain yields as well as minimising environmental degradation such as soil erosion in this region. However, if soil fertility levels are to be maintained, or improved, perennial pasture rotations will need to be used as current levels of fertiliser application or rotations with pulses had no significant beneficial effect.},

abstract={Composting reduces the available nitrogen (N) content of organic materials by immobilizing it and converting it to a slow release form. The effect of composting on phosphorus (P) is less clear. Adding compost to soil can increase water extractable soil P by direct addition, dissolution, displacing sorbed, or reducing sorption capacity for P. Organic acids can affect soil P and vary with compost maturity. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of poultry manure compost on available soil P levels. Compost of different maturities was studied to evaluate the effect of biological activity on extractable P levels in two contrasting soils, a loam and clay. Turkey litter was mixed with orchard grass hay at a 3:1 volume ratio and turned frequently, and temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen were measured regularly. Compost samples were taken at day 0 when the compost was made, and at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Compost maturity determined by the Dewar self-heating and oxygen uptake tests indicated that two-week old compost had greater biological activity than compost at 4 or 8 weeks. Compost samples were added to a loam or clay soil at 0.15 and 0.30-g total P kg soil-1 and then incubated for 8 weeks. At 1 d and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, water-extractable and Mehlich-I extractable P were determined. The effect of compost age was most pronounced in the loam on day 1 with water-extractable P compared to the Mehlich-1 extractable P fraction. These data suggest that water- extractable P may increase when loam soils are amended with biologically active, immature compost or when the sorption capacity of the soil is not sufficient to offset the effects of the compost addition. Because water-extractable P is implicated in runoff events, caution should be exercised in applying immature composts to critical source areas within the watershed, which are most vulnerable to P loss in surface runoff and erosion.},

abstract={A grassland (Miscanthus floridulus (Labill.) Warb) at Chihsing Mountain, northern Taiwan, was burned in July 2001. Soil temperature at 5-cm depth of burned (burned grassland) and undisturbed (grassland and natural forest) sites was monitored. Soil chemical properties of the burned grassland, grassland, natural forest, and dwarf-bamboo (Pseudosassa usawai) sites were analyzed to reveal the effects of fire and vegetation types on soil chemistry. The variation of daily temperature in soil of the burned grassland was 6°C, which was 4.5°C higher than that under a natural forest. However, this phenomenon disappeared within 4 mon due to fast regeneration of the grass. Increases in concentrations of nutrients arising from the additions of fine ash at the burned grassland were not observed in this study. Contrarily, burning increased the soil bulk density of the grassland and decreased the soil pH value, SOM, concentrations of exchangeable cations, CEC, and base saturation. Exposure of soils after fire in this steep area with abundant precipitation may lead to serious soil erosion and nutrient loss. Significant decreases in soil carbon and nitrogen contents were also found in the burned grassland. Determination of the loss of soil C and N caused by intensified mineralization of the organic matter needs further study. Soils from the study sites show the typical characteristics of an Andisol, being strongly acidic, with fewer exchangeable cations, a low base saturation (<3%), and an accumulation of soil organic matter with Al-compounds which are recalcitrant to decomposition. Therefore, the effects of vegetation types (grassland and natural forest) on the contents of SOM, TC, TN, and CEC were not significant. Since bamboo shoots are collected by local people, nutrients may be continuously removed from the site with bamboo resulting in lower concentrations of exchangeable cations, CEC, and SOM compared to the undisturbed grassland and natural forest.},

abstract={Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was evaluated under three land use practices on sloping land of Kolombangara in Solomon Islands (5-12°S, 155-170°W). Three soil management treatments were: (1) natural forest, (2) traditional farming practice, and (3) topsoil removal. The SOC concentration was high in the surface layer of soil under natural forest and decreased sharply with depth. The SOC concentration of the 0-15 cm depth was significantly greater under natural forest (67 g kg-1) compared to the traditional farming (24 g kg-1) and topsoil removal (7 g kg-1) treatments. The depletion of SOC concentration in traditional farming and topsoil removal treatments decreased the mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates. In this strongly structured soil, the traditional farming treatment had no detrimental effect on water stable macroaggregates (WSA) for either of the two depths. WSAs in natural forest had significantly higher SOC concentration compared to the microaggregates. There was no difference in SOC concentration among different aggregate size fractions in the topsoil removal treatment. The traditional farming treatment based on slash-and-burn agriculture depleted the SOC pool in the top 30 cm layer by 52.2 Mg C ha-1 compared with natural forest. The loss of SOC pool in the topsoil removal treatment was 94.8 Mg C ha-1 compared with natural forest. Severe erosion, leading to a complete loss of topsoil as in the case of the topsoil removal treatment, has drastic adverse impacts on productivity and quality of the exposed sub-soil. Thus, there is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture now widely practiced in the Solomon Islands. In this regard, a judicious use of chemical fertilizers and biosolids may be crucial to achieving sustainable production. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Surface horizons of Rhodic Paleudults in the Tennessee Valley region of Alabama contain large amounts of clay (&lt;2 μm) composed of quartz, kaolinite, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, and iron oxides. Similar clay mineralogical suites have been shown to be dispersive, which can lead to the degradation of soil physical properties. Furthermore, some studies have suggested mineralogical enrichment in dispersed colloids versus in situ soil, which can effect transport of sediment-attached pollutants. The historical utilization of conventional tillage practices without cover crops has degraded soil quality in this region; however, reduced tillage systems are becoming common. We evaluated clay dispersibility and mineralogical partitioning for fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Paleudults cropped to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in: (i) a no-till system without a cover crop (NT), (ii) a no-till system with a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop (NTC), (iii) a no-till system with a rye cover crop and fall paratilling (NTCP), and (iv) a conventional tillage system (disking and chisel plowing in the fall followed by disking in spring) (CT). Water dispersible clay (WDC), extractable Fe, and soil organic carbon (SOC) were evaluated for surface (0-1 cm) samples. Particle size distribution (PSD) and clay mineralogy of in situ soil, runoff sediment, and WDC were also determined. Data indicated Fe oxides play a more significant role in clay aggregation than soil organic matter (SOM) in these high Fe systems. Higher clay amounts were recovered with dithionite extractable Fe removed (Fed) compared with SOM removal (33 ± 3% vs 25 ± 4%). The WDC quantities were related to SOC (r2 = 0.65) and negatively correlated with Fed (%) and water stable aggregates (%). Particle size and mineralogy of runoff sediment and WDC mineralogy were similar to in situ soil, suggesting models depicting erosion and sediment-attached pollutant transport can be developed using in situ soil as a surrogate for sediment characterization in these soils.},

abstract={In 1998, a 59-cm sediment box core (PLB98-2) was taken from the deepest part of Pyramid Lake (water depth=106 m), Nevada. Age control for PLB98-2 was provided using a variety of approaches. Dried sediment samples were leached with 10% ultrapure nitric acid and analyzed for their elemental concentrations using standard ICP techniques. The variations in elemental concentrations can be divided into two periods: one prior to European settlement and one influenced by anthropogenic activities. The concentrations of K, Al, Na, Zn, and Mn all began to increase after pre-European manipulation of the watershed in ∼1860, which indicates the increasing soil erosion in the watershed was due to deforestation and development. The highest concentrations of these elements and lithogenic elements such as P, Mg, Fe, Cu, Ba, and Si occurred during the flood event of the 1990s. The Pb enrichment times are similar to what has been observed in estuaries draining the western Sierra Nevada, but the Pb enrichments in Pyramid Lake are much less. The Ca, TOC, TIC, Sr, and Ba concentrations show a strong association that is closely related to drought-wet variations of climate and the construction of Derby Dam for water diversions in the early 1900s. Se concentrations vary with the δ18O of the carbonate in the sediments. Although the δ18O "leads" the other species and Truckee River discharge by a few years, it is an excellent indicator of the hydrological change of Pyramid Lake, which is related to climate changes and human activities. From ∼1920, Mn and Mo vary inversely in the sediments. In general, the Mo concentrations varies directly with the organic carbon content of the sediments from 1910 to ∼1980, suggesting enhanced removal of Mo during times of increased productivity in the lake, and anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface. This coincides with low lake levels. The elemental composition of the sediments in Pyramid Lake clearly reflect the timing of important anthropogenic activities and climatic variations that have taken place within the watershed over the past 240 years.},

abstract={Scientific, political, and social interests have developed recently in the concept of using agricultural soils to sequester carbon. Studies supporting this concept indicate that soil erosion and subsequent redeposition of eroded soils in the same field may establish an ecosystem disequilibrium that promotes the buildup of carbon on agricultural landscapes. The problem is to determine the patterns of soil erosion and redeposition on the landscape and to relate these to soil carbon patterns. Radioactive 137cesium (137Cs) can be used to estimate soil erosion patterns and, more importantly, redeposition patterns at the field level. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between 137Cs, soil erosion, and soil carbon patterns on a small agricultural watershed. Profiles of soils from an upland area and soils in an adjacent riparian system were collected in 5 cm increments and the concentrations of 137Cs and carbon were determined. 137Cs and carbon were uniformly mixed in the upper 15-20 cm of upland soils. 137Cs (Bq g-1) and carbon (%) in the upland soils were significantly correlated (r2 = 0.66). Carbon content of the 0-20 cm layer was higher (1.4 ± 0.3%) in areas of soil deposition than carbon content (1.1 ± 0.3%) in areas of soil erosion as determined by the 137Cs technique. These data suggest that measurements of 137Cs in the soils can be useful for understanding carbon distribution patterns in surface soil. Carbon content of the upland soils ranged from 0.5 to 1.9% with an average of 1.2 ± 0.4% in the 0-20 cm layer while carbon below this upper tilled layer (20-30 cm) ranged from 0.2 to 1.5% with an average of 0.5 ± 0.3%. Total carbon was 2.66 and 3.20 kg m-2 in the upper 20 cm and upper 30 cm of the upland soils, respectively. Carbon content of the 0-20cm layer in the riparian system ranged from 1.1 to 67.0% with an average 11.7 ± 17.1%. Carbon content below 20 cm ranged from 1.8 to 79.3% with an average of 18.3 ± 17.5%. Soil carbon in the upper 20cm of the riparian profile was 10.1 and 15.0 kg m-2 in the upper 30 cm of the riparian profiles. This is an increase of organic carbon by a factor of 3.8 and 4.7 for the upper 20 cm and upper 30 cm of the riparian profiles, respectively, when compared to the upland soil profiles.},

abstract={Sediment cores from two neighbouring lakes (Viitna Linajärv and Viitna Pikkjärv) in northern Estonia were studied to determine lake-level fluctuations during the Holocene and their impact on biogeochemical cycling. Organic matter and pollen records dated by radiocarbon and radiolead indicated a water level rise in both lakes during the early Holocene (c. 10 000-8000 BP). A regression followed around 7500 BP and several transgressions occurred during the latter half of the Holocene, c. 6500 and 3000 BP. Human impact during the last centuries has caused short-term lake-level fluctuations and accelerated sediment accumulation in the lakes. The differences in water depth led to variations in sediment formation. During 10 000-8000 BP (Preboreal and Boreal chronozones) mineral-rich sediments with coloured interlayers deposited in L. Linajärv. These sediments indicate intensive erosion from the catchment and oxygen-rich lake, which favoured precipitation of iron oxides and carbonates. Fluctuations in water depth, leaching of nutrients from catchment soils and climatic changes increased the trophy of L. Linajärv around 6000 BP. The subsequent accumulation of gyttja, the absence of CaCO3 and the decrease in both the C/N ratio and phosphorus content in the sediments also indicate anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion. The similarity in the development of L. Linajärv and L. Pikkjärv and their proximity made it possible to discern the impact of water depths changes on biogeochemical cycling in lakes.},

abstract={Soil aggregate formation is controlled by crop and soil management, mineral, carbon and ion contents, internal drainage and associated weathering processes. Plant carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) components of soil organic matter (SOM) are key ingredients controlling the formation, function, and stability of soil aggregates. Although SOM content has been reported to be associated with aggregates of different size fractions, little is known of the soil C and N dynamics occurring within aggregates of different size fractions. Using stainless steel soil aggregate erosion (SAE) chambers, we have been able to identify multiple gradients within concentric layers from large numbers of individual soil aggregates ranging in size from 1-15 mm across. Soil tillage, cultivation, cover crops and rotations greatly modify the locations and concentrations of C, N, P and microbial communities within soil aggregates. Soil C recently deposited on aggregate surfaces is highly labile while most older and more recalcitrant C is sequestered in the central regions of aggregates. Soil aggregates associated with living roots of cover crops sequester much more N than shoot N or when plants are absent. A greater understanding of the dynamics within and at surfaces of soil aggregates will solve many mysteries of the magnificent root soil interface. © OECD 2003.},

abstract={Erosion changes soil properties, especially physical properties, mainly because it removes surface soil rich in organic materials and exposes lower soil layers. In 1988, a study was established to determine the effects of soil erosion and long-term manure applications on selected soil physical properties and corn (Zea mays L.) production. After 10 years of annual manure applications, soil core samples were collected in 7.6-cm increments at three depths, 0 to 7.6, 15 to 22.6, and 30 to 37.6 cm, to determine soil bulk density (ρ b), hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil (Ks), and water retention. Bulk density and Ks increased slightly with erosion level. Water retention did not change in the surface 7.6 cm, but it did decrease with increasing erosion level at deeper depths. Long-term application of manure decreased ρb by 10%, whereas Ks was doubled in the top 7.6 cm of soil. Manure increased soil-water retention capacity and decreased differences in water retention between erosion levels, especially at low suctions (0 to 20 kPa). Soil carbon content correlated well with water retention and ρb. Corn grain yields in 1997, 1998, and 1999 were 15, 6, and 14% less, respectively, in the severe than in the slight erosion phase. Long-term manure additions increased corn grain yields by 19% in 1998 and by 25% in 1999. Increased yield from manure additions was likely related to an enhancement in water retention. Results from this study show that long-term manure application is a possible management alternative for restoring the physical properties and crop productivity of eroded soil.},

abstract={The range of soil properties associated with soil taxonomic class results from natural soil formation and soil-changing effects of human activity. My goal was to assess cultivation effects on soil formation and soil organic carbon (SOC) at four cultivated and two native hummocky till sites from the same climatic region of Saskatchewan. A revised landform segmentation procedure was used for comparisons across sites. Neither A horizon thickness nor SOC was related to topographical attributes at the native sites, but both had significant relationships (P = 0.001) with profile curvature (Pearson r = -0.53 and -0.57 for A horizon thickness and SOC, respectively), specific dispersal area (r = -0.40 and -0.54) and plan curvature (r = -0.24 and -0.34) at the cultivated sites. The greatest decreases in A horizon thickness (16 cm) and SOC (56 Mg ha-1) at the cultivated sites occurred in divergent shoulder elements, which have high rates of tillage-induced soil loss. Increases in soil thickness (including depth to calcium carbonate) occurred in concave footslope and depressional elements, but in situ losses of SOC outweighed the effects of SOC deposition. Soil thinning caused increases in the proportion of Orthic Regosols and decreases in the proportion of Calcareous Chernozems, but horizonation changes in the dominant Orthic Chernozems were minor. The self-terminating nature of the horizonation changes and improved conservation measures suggest that the future rate of soil change in these landscapes may be lower than in the past.},

abstract={Earlier studies in South Africa had shown that water repellency in the soils of timber plantations was associated with a greater risk of overland flow and soil erosion on mountain slopes. This paper reports on a follow-up study to determine how prevalent water repellent soils are in the forestry areas of South Africa, and to what extent this phenomenon is associated with specific vegetation types. Soils from a representative series of forestry sites around South Africa were sampled from beneath each genus or plantation type and the range of local vegetation types. These soils were dried at l ow oven temperatures and then subjected to a series of tests of soil wettability, namely, water drop penetration time, infiltration rate, critical surface tension and apparent advancing contact angle as determined by the equilibrium capillary rise test. Water repellency is common in dried soils from timber plantations. The dominant variation in repellency is explained by the different vegetation types: soils beneath eucalypts are most repellent, followed by those beneath wattle (Acacia species), indigenous forest and pine. Soils beneath grassland and fynbos scrub were least likely to show repellency, perhaps because regular fires remove plant litter and thus the potential for hydrophobic substances to develop. Soil characteristics explained very little of the variation in repellency. Organic carbon content was weakly correlated with higher repellency, but organic carbon content and soil texture added little explanation to models that first accounted for variation in vegetation type and point of origin. These results are broadly the same regardless of which method of measuring repellency was used. However, the critical surface tension test was far superior to the others in terms of information gained, speed, efficiency and statistical utility of the resultant scores. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The137Cs spatial redistribution data have been widely used to estimate soil redistribution rates over the past 45 years approximately. However, the frequent changes in land use in China have limited the general application of the137Cs tracer technique to soil erosion or deposition budget on the mid- / long-term. In this paper, soil137Cs measurements and some chemical properties, such as the soil organic carbon and available phosphorus contents, were simultaneously used to identify sediment sources and to reveal the spatial characteristics of soil redistribution. The deposition rates after and before the changes in local land use could be estimated using the approach proposed in this study. The reclamation of formerly uncultivated slopes was found to lead not only to striking accelerated soil erosion but also to considerable changes in the slope form. A typical footslope site on 5-year-old reclaimed sloping land which appeared to have experienced net erosion before 1997, has become a site with deposition reaching a rate of 3.0 cm year−1 since 1997. Besides the soil137Cs activity, the soil organic carbon content was found to be a very meaningful indicator of the extent of soil erosion or deposition, and the significant difference in the soil available phosphorus content between uncultivated and cultivated land could become a very sensitive and suitable criterion for identifying sediment sources under different land uses. © 2003, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Due to severe land degradation problems, soil conservation is a matter of major concern in the Ecuadorian Andes. Slow-forming terraces, a variation of hedgerow agro-forestry systems composed by contour grass barrier strips, can be considered as the most frequently used technique in Andean rural communities of Ecuador. However, due to shallow soils, terrace development often has the disadvantage causing gradients in soil properties from the upper to the lower elevations within the terrace. The main objectives of this study were to assess (i) spatial variability in soil properties on slow-forming terraces in the Andes and (ii) implications of variability for the management of this soil conservation technique. In order to measure spatial variability, soil sampling (0-15 cm) was carried out in bands following the contour, which were located every 1 m beginning at the highest point of elevation and including the lowest point on the terrace. Soil properties, such as pH(H2O), pH(NaF), organic carbon, total nitrogen, NO3-, P, K, exchangeable aluminium, P fixation, exchangeable bases, cationic exchange capacity, base saturation and texture, were monitored on eight terraces, having slopes from 15 to 30%, a length of 4-8 m and soils ranging from Cambisols to Phaeozems, in the Ecuadorian Andes (Gima, Azuay). Terraces, which were 2-4 years, were managed in a traditional or more intensified way (i.e. without or with the application of organic manure). Bufferstrips were composed by (i) Pennisetum clandestinum and Lolium multiflorum or (ii) Phalaris tuberosa. Spatial variability was analysed by stepwise multiple regression analysis, where position on the terrace was the independent variable and soil property was the dependent variable. Factor analysis was carried out in order to compare spatial variability patterns of the terraces and formulate management strategies. High spatial variability in soil properties was found. Although spatial variation was site dependent, it was clear that soil fertility increased from the upper to the lower part of the terraces. The present study shows that management strategy could influence the pattern and magnitude of spatial variation. Site-specific soil fertility improvement is suggested as means to combat variation caused by tillage erosion in slow-forming terraces. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. Land area globally affected by erosion is 1094 million ha (Mha) by water erosion, of which 751 Mha is severely affected, and 549 Mha by wind erosion, of which 296 Mha is severely affected. Whereas the effects of erosion on productivity and non-point source pollution are widely recognized, those on the C dynamics and attendant emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are not. Despite its global significance, erosion-induced carbon (C) emission into the atmosphere remains misunderstood and an unquantified component of the global carbon budget. Soil erosion is a four-stage process involving detachment, breakdown, transport/redistribution and deposition of sediments. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is influenced during all four stages. Being a selective process, erosion preferentially removes the light organic fraction of a low density of &lt; 1.8 Mg/m3. A combination of mineralization and C export by erosion causes a severe depletion of the SOC pool on eroded compared with uneroded or slightly eroded soils. In addition, the SOC redistributed over the landscape or deposited in depressional sites may be prone to mineralization because of breakdown of aggregates leading to exposure of hitherto encapsulated C to microbial processes among other reasons. Depending on the delivery ratio or the fraction of the sediment delivered to the river system, gross erosion by water may be 75 billion Mg, of which 15-20 billion Mg are transported by the rivers into the aquatic ecosystems and eventually into the ocean. The amount of total C displaced by erosion on the earth, assuming a delivery ratio of 10% and SOC content of 2-3%, may be 4.0-6.0 Pg/year. With 20% emission due to mineralization of the displaced C, erosion-induced emission may be 0.8-1.2 Pg C/year on the earth. Thus, soil erosion has a strong impact on the global C cycle and this component must be considered while assessing the global C budget. Adoption of conservation-effective measures may reduce the risks of C emission and sequester C in soil and biota. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Carbon (C) sequestration in soil implies enhancing the concentrations/ pools of soil organic matter and secondary carbonates. It is achieved through adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs) on soils of agricultural, grazing, and forestry ecosystems, and conversion of degraded soils and drastically disturbed lands to restorative land use. Of the 916 million hectares (Mha) comprising the total land area in the continental United States and Alaska, 157 Mha (17.1%) are under cropland, 336 Mha (36.7%) under grazing land, 236 Mha (25.8%) under forest, 14 Mha (1.5%) under Conservation Reserve Programs (CRP), and 20 Mha (2.2%) are under urban land use. Land areas affected by different soil degradative processes include 52 Mha affected by water erosion, 48 Mha by wind erosion, 0.2 Mha by secondary salinization, and more than 4 Mha affected by mining. Adoption of RMPs can lead to sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) at an annual rate of 45 to 98 Tg (teragram = 1 × 1012 g = 1 million metric tons or MMT) in cropland, 13 to 70 Tg in grazing land, and 25 to 102 Tg in forestlands. In addition, there is an annual soil C sequestration potential of 21 to 77 Tg by land conversion, 25 to 60 Tg by land restoration, and 15 to 25 Tg by management of other land uses. Thus, the total potential of C sequestration in soils of the United States is 144 to 432 Tg/y or an average of 288 Tg C/y. With the implementation of suitable policy initiatives, this potential is realizable for up to 30 years or when the soil C sink capacity is filled. In comparison, emission by agricultural activities is estimated at 43 Tg C/y, and the current rate of SOC sequestration is reported as 17 Tg C/y. The challenge the policy makers face is to be able to develop and implement policies that are conducive to realization of this potential.},

abstract={Livestock grazing is recognised as one of the main causes of vegetation and soil degradation/desertification in the semi-arid Horqin sandy steppe of northern China. In this paper, soil-plant system carbon (C) in a representative degraded sandy grassland in the Horqin sandy steppe (42°58’ N, 120°42'E altitude c. 360 m a.s.l.) was measured. Three situations: long-term continuous grazing (CG), exclosure for 5 years (5EX), and exclosure for 10 years (10EX), were compared to assess the effect of grazing management on C sequestration. Ground cover increased from the CG (35%) to the 5EX (63%) and to the 10EX (81%), and accordingly soil organic C at 0–15 cm depth and total plant components C increased from the CG (492 and 98 g m–2) to the 5EX (524and 134 g m–2) and to the 10EX (584 and 317 g m–2). The results suggested that continuous grazing in the erosion-prone sandy grassland is very detrimental to vegetation and soil. Under exclosure conditions, vegetation restoration and litter accumulation significantly increased plant-soil system C storage, and thus sequestration of atmospheric C. It was concluded that the degraded sandy grassland could contribute to significant C sequestration with the implementation of protective practices. © 2003 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Estimation of possible organic input into arctic basin due to coastal thermal erosion in Eastern Arctic was carried out. The content of Corg for different types of Quaternary deposits and modern soil was determined. Influence of modern soil, vegetation and volumetric ice content on amount of Corg outflow was taken in to account. It has been determined that the supply of coastal erosion in to organic budget of Arctic basin can reach 1,8 mln tons per year. Most organic matter in marine sediment in Laptev and East-Siberian seas is allochthonous. Current research is based on the data obtained during works on the Yakutian coastal lowlands. © A.L.

abstract={The cycle of organic carbon burial and exhumation moderates atmospheric chemistry and global climate over geologic timescales. The burial of organic carbon occurs predominantly at sea in association with clay-sized particles derived from the erosion of uplifted continental rocks. It follows that the history of the fine-grained particles on land may bear on the nature of the organic carbon buried. In this study, the evolution of clay-associated organic matter was followed from bedrock source to the seabed in the Eel River sedimentary system of northern California using natural abundance 13C and 14C tracers. Approximately half of the fine-grained organic carbon delivered to the shelf is derived from ancient sedimentary organic carbon found in the uplifted Mesozoic-Tertiary Franciscan Complex of the watershed. The short residence time of friable soils on steep hill slopes, coupled with rapid sediment accumulation rates on the shelf-slope, act to preserve the ancient organic carbon. A comparable quantity of modern organic carbon is added to particles in the watershed and on the shelf and slope. The bimodal mixture of ancient and modern C in soils and sediments may be characteristic of many short, mountainous rivers. If the Eel River chemistry is typical of such rivers, more than 40 Tg of ancient organic C may be delivered to the world's oceans each year. A flux of that magnitude would have a significant influence on marine and global C-cycles. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={We compute the particulate organic carbon (POC) yield of the Waipaoa River, New Zealand, using sediment rating curves in conjunction with measurements of the carbon content of the suspended sediment. To ascertain the source of the carbon and the extent to which the POC flux is tied to different erosion processes, we determined the stable isotopic carbon composition (δ 13C) and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of weathered bedrock, soil, and regolith. Most POC is derived from suspended sediment generated by gully erosion (incision into weathered bedrock), supplemented by landsliding during extreme events. The specific yield of POC from the headwaters (drainage area 1580 km2) is 55 g m-2 yr-1, which is very high by global standards and by comparison with other turbid steep-land rivers. The annual loss to floodplain storage is ∼4% (3.6 Kt) of the mean annual POC yield (86.7 Kt). Thus the Waipaoa River is a very effective conduit for transporting POC to the ocean.},

abstract={A study of lipid biomarkers in predominantly laminated, organic carbon-rich sediments in Lake Albano (central Italy) has been used to reconstruct changes in the aquatic system variations and changes in the lake catchment area during the Holocene. Biomarkers of aquatic organic matter such as dinosterol, isoarborinol, tetrahymanol, diplopterol, and diploptene reflect two major changes in the mixing behaviour and the biological assemblages of Lake Albano at around 6.5 and 3.8 ky BP, respectively. Biomarkers for higher land plants such as friedelin, long-chain n-alkanes, β-amyrenone and α-amyrenone display different distribution patterns, indicating changes in the lake's catchment at 6.5 and 5.0 ky BP, resulting from soil erosion and changes in the local vegetation. Analogously, the recognised changes in the water column structure and biological components are coherent with previous reconstructions based on independent parameters. The new data highlight the importance of multiproxy studies to better characterize palaeoenvironmental changes that are in turn the first step towards elucidating their trigger mechanisms (i.e. climate vs. human-induced). © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks are presented for Central and Eastern Europe. The study uses the soil geographic and attribute data held in a 1:2 500 000 scale Soil and Terrain (SOTER) database, covering Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation (west of the Urals), Slovakia, and Ukraine. Means and coefficients of variation for soil organic carbon and total nitrogen are presented for each major FAO soil grouping. The mean content of organic carbon, to a depth of 1 m, ranges from 3.9 kgCm-2 for coarse textured Arenosols to 72.9 kgCm-2 for poorly drained Histosols. Mean carbon content for the mineral soils, excluding Arenosols, is 15.8 kgCm-2. The top 1 m of soil holds 110 Pg C (Pg=1015 g), which corresponds to about 7% of the global stock of soil organic carbon. About 44% of this carbon pool is held in the top 0.3 m of the soil, the layer that is most prone to be changed by changes in soil use and management. About 166 million ha in Central and Eastern Europe have been degraded by compaction, erosion of topsoil, fertility decline and crusting. The achievable level of carbon sequestration for these soils, upon adoption of 'best' management practices or restorative measures, is estimated.},

abstract={We have studied eleven soils located along a transect that includes two toposequences on contrasted litological materials: marl limestone from the Cretaceous and hard limestone from the Jurassic. These soils occupy vary geomorphological positions and are submitted to different types of management. There are agricultural soils in use. soils that occupy marginal positions, that are not cultivated currently, and forestry soils. Soils developed on both litologies present very different chemical characteristics. On marl limestone there are developed soils with carbonate high content and reduced fertility level while on hard limestone there are situated red soils that can be completely decarbonated and that have higher chemical fertility level. The organic matter content, determinant component of soil fertility, shows a direct relation with the type of management to which soil is submitted: soils that aren't ploughed on which permanent wild vegetation grows, have higher contents than when they are ploughed. So, soils located on hill slopes, when ploughed, are very vulnerable to water erosion. If ploughing stops and permanent wild vegetation is installed soil fertility increases and also its resistance to erosive phenomena.},

abstract={A reduction in plant cover can lead to an increase in the erosion processes that diminish soil quality. Any rise in temperature resulting from predicted climate changes may aggravate this effect, particularly in semiarid Mediterranean areas. Bearing this in mind, the capacity of a soil to preserve organic matter becomes very important if the soil is to maintain its physical and chemical properties. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen changes were evaluated in a non-disturbed (with natural vegetation) and a disturbed (all vegetation manually clipped to ground level) pine system. Nine years after vegetation removal significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) were found in the soil organic carbon content between plots (top 20 cm), but not in total nitrogen. In the disturbed plot 0.0232 Mg ha-1 y-1 of soil organic carbon were lost through erosion and 4.30 Mg ha-1 y-1 through mineralization. In the first 48 months after vegetation removal the soil organic carbon content fell from 40.3 to 28.0 g kg-1. In the last 60 months of the experiment the amount of organic carbon in the soil fell from 28.0 to 27.7 g kg-1. This result was mainly attributable to the intense oxidization, which took place during the first 60 months, of organic matter linked to the coarse soil mineral fraction. Up to the 72nd month the losses by erosion were a total of 532.7 g, which rose to 1284.4 g by the end of the experiment (108 months). The effect of vegetation removal in a Mediterranean semiarid area leads to a rapid decline in the amount of organic carbon stored in the soil. Such perturbation is irreversible if left to nature.},

abstract={The method of a technogenic magnetic tracer has been applied to assess the rates of soil erosion in the area of ancient (1000 BP) Indian mounds on the Mississippi River terrace with predominant vertic meadow soils (Vertic Haplaquolls). The content and distribution patterns of fly ash (technogenic magnetic spherules) in the soil profiles and the magnitudes of magnetic susceptibility have been analyzed together with data on the topsoil thickness and the organic carbon content. All studied soils contain from 30 to 150 g/m2 of magnetic spherules with sizes varying from 1 to 50 μm. From 90 to 99% of these spherules are concentrated in the uppermost 5 cm of the soil profile. The content of fly ash in forested soils is two to four times higher than that in meadow soils. Eroded soils of the mounds are characterized by a lower content of the spherules and a smaller depth of their penetration into the soil profile in comparison with noneroded soils. The average rate of erosion for unplowed mounds is estimated at several hundred g/m 2 per year. Copyright © 2002 by MAIK "Nauk /Interperiodica" (Russia).},

abstract={Soils perform a large variety of functions involved in regulation of biogeochemical fluxes between the atmosphere and the aquatic environment. Soil characteristics show significant variation spatially, in the diversity of physical, physico-chemical and biological processes. Soils also vary with respect to their location as an interface with the atmosphere, the geological substrate and aquatic environments. The time-scales governing the formation of soils are generally long, ranging from a thousands to millions of years and therefore, they are not a renewable resource from the human perspective. The functions involved in soil regulation can be modified by various forms of stress related to farming, industrial and urban activities. In soil management, the catchment slope or watershed represents the most appropriate spatial scale for the assessment and understanding of soil distribution. Throughout history, soil use has changed drastically depending on different environmental constraints, the available technology and the requirements of the human population. In order to manage soil, it is necessary to acquire a complete understanding of the conditions under which it has been formed. The chemical evolution of soils is related to natural processes. For example, in temperate regions, the main factor dictating soil evolution is the gradual loss of cations. These reductions in cations affect soil carbonates, which are gradually dissolved. Following the dissolution of soil carbonates, there are changes in levels of exchangeable cations, initially with the calcium found on the surface of the soil components (clay, organic matter and oxides). The soil then becomes acidic, and when the acidity becomes sufficiently low, the mineral components of the soil can be partially dissolved. Free aluminum can therefore be present in the soil and water, thus creating toxic conditions for plants (cultivated soils, forests) and to fish (pond water and river water). Changes in soil use and the introduction of new practices often have a considerable impact on soil components and soil properties. In the soils of France today, the carbon and nitrogen balances are generally negative. This results in a widespread reduction in the levels of organic matter. Cultivated soils generally imply CO2 emission into the atmosphere, often related to grassland cultivation and to other intensive farming practices (ARROUAYS et al., 1994; RIVIÈRE, 1999). Measuring and modeling the environmental balance therefore represents a major challenge both with respect to the protection of the soil environment and also with respect to understanding the global cycle of greenhouse gases such as nitrogen and carbon compounds. The presence of contaminants and the study of their bioavailability also represent major challenges in soil research. Certain parent rocks contain a appreciable quantities of potentially toxic trace elements (Pb, Cd, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, As). The continuous supply of substances containing pollutants results in greater inflows of trace elements than outflows. In France, there are an estimated 36000 t/yr of copper applied to French vineyards. Regions with intensive indoor husbandry, such as Brittany, are also concerned with the addition of copper and zinc in animal diets. The supply of phosphates as fertilizers has also been a source of cadmium pollution. Urban waste is also a recent source of pollution, and the effects of air-based pollution around industrial zones needs to be taken into consideration. Human activity affects not only the storage and transfer of water and dissolved elements, but also the aeration and temperature conditions that could impact biological activity. Although the organization of solid particles and pores is partially a result of conditions under which the soil has been formed, human activity both directly (cultivation methods, soil drainage) and indirectly (influence of plant and fauna activity) influences the physical properties of soil. For example, the general trend is for the organic matter content to decrease with an increase in soil use (ploughing of grassland). This is particularly true in the case of silty soils, which contain small quantities of clay and are thus less stable structurally and are susceptible to physical erosion. Soil chemistry also affects physical properties. For example, under slightly acidic conditions, soil particles can become highly mobile in the environment. The migration of clay from the upper soil layers to the lower layers (translocation) should not be ignored. This relative loss of clay from the surface can be observed over time as the soil becomes particularly sensitive to the effects of water (incrustation, particle suspension) and, finally, erosion and run-off occur. Soil science must provide a reservoir of knowledge in order to increase the understanding of soil functions and to meet the needs of agriculture and the environment. The study of soil must incorporate both spatial and temporal trends, as changes are often slow and difficult to detect. This demonstrates the need to reassess soil with respect to its environmental functions, without limiting the assessment to merely the function of production.},

abstract={Excessive grazing pressure is detrimental to plant productivity and may lead to declines in soil organic matter. Soil organic matter is an important source of plant nutrients and can enhance soil aggregation, limit soil erosion, and can also increase cation exchange and water holding capacities, and is, therefore, a key regulator of grassland ecosystem processes. Changes in grassland management which reverse the process of declining productivity can potentially lead to increased soil C. Thus, rehabilitation of areas degraded by overgrazing can potentially sequester atmospheric C. We compiled data from the literature to evaluate the influence of grazing intensity on soil C. Based on data contained within these studies, we ascertained a positive linear relationship between potential C sequestration and mean annual precipitation which we extrapolated to estimate global C sequestration potential with rehabilitation of overgrazed grassland. The GLASOD and IGBP DISCover data sets were integrated to generate a map of overgrazed grassland area for each of four severity classes on each continent. Our regression model predicted losses of soil C with decreased grazing intensity in drier areas (precipitation less than 333 mm yr-1), but substantial sequestration in wetter areas. Most (93%) C sequestration potential occurred in areas with MAP less than 1800 mm. Universal rehabilitation of overgrazed grasslands can sequester approximately 45 Tg C yr-1, most of which can be achieved simply by cessation of overgrazing and implementation of moderate grazing intensity. Institutional level investments by governments may be required to sequester additional C.},

abstract={The combination of soil erosion and restrictive subsurface features can adversely influence root growth and crop productivity. The effects of depth to a restrictive layer on yield and root development were determined for soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and corn (Zea mays L.) grown on Grenada silt loam (Oxyaquic Fraglossudalfs) in West Tennessee. Seven sites were selected in a cropped field where depth to the fragipan ranged from 0 to 107 cm below the soil surface. Across-the-site comparisons involving bulk density, soil color, exchangeable acidity and organic carbon indicated that at the sites that were shallow to the fragipan, profile modification had occurred as a result of soil erosion. Soils were sampled to 120 cm depths in 15 cm increments within the row and 25 and 51 cm from the row. Roots were extracted and total root lengths were determined by the line-intercept method. Greater total root lengths were observed with increasing depth to the fragipan. Crop yields decreased significantly as depth to the fragipan decreased. Soybean yields ranged from 0.5 Mg ha-1 on the 0 cm depth site to 2.8 Mg ha-1 on the 107 cm depth site, whereas corn yields ranged from 5.5 Mg ha-1 on the 0 cm depth site to 10.0 Mg ha-1 on the 107 cm depth site. Erosion was not measured directly; however, the reduced soil depth due to erosion caused an easily demonstrated reduction in root growth and yield in both corn and soybean. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Rock weathering is the ultimate source of phosphorus (P) to the oceans, where P can be a limiting nutrient for biological production. In this paper, P weathering is examined in soil chronosequences formed in weathering profiles on the organic-rich Woodford Shale, New Albany Shale and Green River Shale. At all sites, organic P and inorganic P concentrations reveal that P weathering is far from complete, prior to erosion. Carbon (C)/P ratios decrease significantly from unweathered shale to the weathered shale at all sites, which is driven by loss of total organic C with weathering. Here we characterize organic phosphorus across a weathering profile from the Woodford Shale using solid-state CPMAS 31P NMR spectroscopy techniques, revealing that P esters are the dominant forms of P during all stages of weathering. Certain P esters appear to be resistant to chemical weathering during the millions of years between deposition, uplift and erosion, possibly representing a significant long-term global sink for P.},

abstract={We review the evidence for multiple ecological states and the factors that create ecological resilience in coral reef ecosystems. There are natural differences among benthic communities along gradients of water temperature, light, nutrients, and organic matter associated with upwelling-downwelling and onshore-offshore systems. Along gradients from oligotrophy to eutrophy, plant-animal symbioses tend to decrease, and the abundance of algae and heterotrophic suspension feeders and the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon production tend to increase. Human influences such as fishing, increased organic matter and nutrients, sediments, warm water, and transportation of xenobiotics and diseases are common causes of a large number of recently reported ecological shifts. It is often the interaction of persistent and multiple synergistic disturbances that causes permanent ecological transitions, rather than the succession of individual short-term disturbances. For example, fishing can remove top-level predators, resulting in the ecological release of prey such as sea urchins and coral-eating invertebrates. When sea urchins are not common because of unsuitable habitat, recruitment limitations, and diseases, and when overfishing removes herbivorous fish, frondose brown algae can dominate. Terrigenous sediments carried onto reefs as a result of increased soil erosion largely promote the dominance of turf or articulated green algae. Elevated nutrients and organic matter can increase internal eroders of reef substratum and a mixture of filamentous algae. Local conservation actions that attempt to reduce fishing and terrestrial influences promote the high production of inorganic carbon that is necessary for reef growth. However, global climate change threatens to undermine such actions because of increased bleaching and mortality caused by warm-water anomalies, weakened coral skeletons caused by reduced aragonite availability in reef waters, and increased incidence of diseases in coral reef species. Consequently, many coral reefs, including those that are heavily managed, have experienced net losses in accumulated inorganic carbon in recent decades and appear likely to continue this trend in coming decades. Reefs urgently need to be managed with a view to strengthening their resilience to the increased frequency and intensity of these pressures. Ecological targets must include the restoration or maintenance of species diversity, keystone species, spatial heterogeneity, refugia, and connectivity. Achieving these goals will require unprecedented cooperative synergy between human organizations at all political levels, from intergovernmental to local. Copyright © 2002 by the author(s).

abstract={Gaseous exchange between surface soil and the atmosphere is an important process in the environmental fate of many chemicals. It was hypothesized that this process is influenced by vertical transport of chemicals sorbed to soil particles. Vertical sorbed phase transport in surface soils occurs by many processes such as bioturbation, cryoturbation, and erosion into cracks formed by soil drying. The solution of the advection/diffusion equation proposed by Jury et al. to describe organic chemical fate in a uniformly contaminated surface soil was modified to include vertical sorbed phase transport. This process was modeled using a sorbed phase diffusion coefficient, the value of which was derived from soil carbon mass balances in the literature. The effective diffusivity of the chemical in a typical soil was greater in the modified model than in the model without sorbed phase transport for compounds with log KOW &gt; 2 and log KOA &gt; 6. Within this chemical partitioning space, the rate of volatilization from the surface soil was larger in the modified model than in the original model by up to a factor of 65. The volatilization rate was insensitive to the value of the sorbed phase diffusion coefficient throughout much of this chemical partitioning space, indicating that the surface soil layer was essentially well-mixed and that the mass transfer coefficient was determined by diffusion through the atmospheric boundary layer only. When this process was included in a non-steady-state regional multimedia chemical fate model running with a generic emissions scenario to air, the predicted soil concentrations increased by up to a factor of 25, while the air concentrations decreased by as much as a factor of ∼ 3. Vertical sorbed phase transport in the soil thus has a major impact on predicted air and soil concentrations, the state of equilibrium, and the direction and magnitude of the chemical flux between air and soil. It is a key process influencing the environmental fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).},

abstract={The industrial emission of carbon (C) in China in 2000 was about 1 Pg yr-1, which may surpass that of the United States (1.84 Pg C) by 2020. China's large land area, similar in size to that of the United States, comprises 124 Mha of cropland, 400 Mha of grazing land and 134 Mha of forestland. Terrestrial C pool of China comprises about 35-60 Pg in the forest and 120-186 Pg in soils. Soil degradation is a major issue affecting 145 Mha by different degradative processes, of which 126 Mha are prone to accelerated soil erosion. Total annual loss by erosion is estimated at 5.5 Pg of soil and 15.9 Tg of soil organic carbon (SOC). Erosion-induced emission of C into the atmosphere may be 32-64 Tg yr-1. The SOC pool progressively declined from the 1930s to 1980s in soils of northern China and slightly increased in those of southern China because of change in land use. Management practices that lead to depletion of the SOC stock are cultivation of upland soils, negative nutrient balance in cropland, residue removal, and soil degradation by accelerated soil erosion and salinization and the like. Agricultural practices that enhance the SOC stock include conversion of upland to rice paddies, integrated nutrient management based on liberal use of biosolids and compost, crop rotations that return large quantities of biomass, and conservation-effective systems. Adoption of recommended management practices can increase SOC concentration in puddled soil, red soil, loess soils, and salt-affected soils. In addition, soil restoration has a potential to sequester SOC. Total potential of soil C sequestration in China is 105-198 Tg C yr-1 of SOC and 7-138 Tg C yr-1 for soil inorganic carbon (SIC). The accumulative potential of soil C sequestration of 11 Pg at an average rate of 224 Tg yr-1 may be realized by 2050. Soil C sequestration potential can offset about 20 per cent of the annual industrial emissions in China. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Soil erosion and off-site transport of nutrients are reducing soil productivity and impacting water bodies across the world. Additionally, anthropogenic activities are increasing the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) that contribute to global warming. We want to present the concept that nutrient management plans should incorporate soil organic carbon (SOC) management to reduce soil erosion, cycle macro- and micronutrients, increase nutrient use efficiency, and conserve air, soil, and water quality. Plant-derived materials are the primary source of carbon (C) in soil organic matter (SOM), with C being the most abundant constituent and common partner of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and sulfur (S). Manures, compost, and other organic sources can help cycle organic C and other nutrients. Organic C can contribute to forming chelate compounds that increase the availability of essential micronutrients that interchange with the root surface. Management practices that increase C inputs, help reduce erosion, and increase SOC improve soil quality factors such as cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, aggregate formation, porosity, and drainage. Carbon management and nutrient cycling should be an integral part of nutrient management plans for maintaining the sustainability of our biosphere.},

abstract={A general assumption in many agroecosystem C and N turnover models is that the decomposition of added organic matter starts at the moment of residue incorporation into the soil. In fact, decomposition is already initiated on the surface of the soil. This decomposition of surface crop residues has been modelled mainly to describe the decrease in soil cover which protects the soil surface from erosive forces, but not to simulate change in surface crop residue quality and mineralisation of C and N. Therefore, we included a surface decomposition submodel in an existing mineralisation model and tested the new C and N turnover model using data from a field site study. The results show that the new model is able to describe the C and N turnover of crop residues in more detail, including the decrease of soil cover observed in the field.},

abstract={Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (WF) using conventional stubble mulch tillage (CT) is the predominant production practice in the central Great Plains and has resulted in high erosion potential and decreased soil organic C (SOC) contents. This study, conducted from 1990 through 1994 on a Weld silt loam (Aridic Argiustoll) near Akron, CO, evaluated the effect of WF tillage system with varying degrees of soil disturbance [no-till (NT), reduced till (RT), CT, and bare fallow (BF)] and crop rotation [WF, NT wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow (WCF), and NT continuous corn (CC)] on winter wheat and corn yields, aboveground residue additions to the soil at harvest, surface residue amounts at planting, and SOC. Neither tillage nor crop rotation affected winter wheat yields, which averaged 2930 kg ha-1. Corn grain yields for the CC (NT) and WCF (NT) rotations averaged 1980 and 3520 kg ha-1, respectively. The WCF (NT) rotation returned 8870 kg ha-1 residue to the soil in each 3-yr cycle, which is 2960 kg ha-1 on an annualized basis. Annualized residue return in WF averaged 2520 kg ha-1, which was 15% less than WCF (NT). Annualized corn residue returned to the soil was 3190 kg ha-1 for the CC (NT) rotation. At wheat planting, surface crop residues varied with year, tillage, and rotation, averaging WCF (NT) (5120 kg ha-1) &gt; WF (NT) (3380 kg ha-1) &gt; WF (RT) (2140 kg ha-1) &gt; WF (CT) (1420 kg ha-1) &gt; WF (BF) (50 kg ha-1). Soil erosion potential was lessened with WCF (NT), CC (NT), and WF (NT) systems because of the large amounts of residue cover. Levels of SOC in descending order in 1994 were CC (NT) ≥ WCF (NT) ≥ WF (NT) = WF (RT) = WF (CT) &gt; WF (BF). Although not statistically significant, the CC (NT) treatment appeared to be accumulating more SOC than any of the rotations that included a fallow period, even more rapidly than WCF (NT), which had a similar amount of annualized C addition. Reduced tillage and intensified cropping increased SOC and reduced soil erosion potential.},

abstract={Paleolimnological techniques were used to assess human impacts on Lake Blanca, a small (0.6 km2), coastal fresh waterbody in southern Uruguay, which is the drinking water source for ∼100,000 local residents. We retrieved a core that extends to about 1100 14C yr BP. 210Pb ages, organic mater, CO3, total carbon, nutrients, fossil pigments and diatoms allowed us to establish limnological conditions before and after cultural impacts. Soil removal (1880-1960) and intensive cattle and sheep grazing (1943-1966) led to gully formation in the catchment. This watershed erosion resulted in increased sedimentation rates. The aquatic system appeared to be mesotrophic with dominance of epibenthic diatoms until ∼1966, at which time eutrophication intensified with forestry activities. Increases in nutrients, as well as blooms of planktonic diatoms, were observed. During the last decade, tourist/urban development as well as high drinking water demand caused a reduction in lake area. Subsequent marked increases in rainfall led to further phytoplankton blooms and macrophyte proliferation.},

abstract={Soil carbon densities and pools have been estimated for Russia. The estimate was derived from the generalized version of the soil map of the country at the scale 1:2.5 million (Fridland, 1988), which has been designated a countrywide standard. At the pre-developed stage, the soils in Russia captured about 373 Pg of organic and 75 Pg of inorganic C in the 0-2.0 m layer. Organic C is intensively accumulated in the topsoil. Inorganic C tends to concentrate in deep soils and is of non-pedogenic origin. The mass of organic matter is captured in the tundra, pre-tundra, and the northern and middle taiga of Russia. Anthropogenic impacts have led to a loss of about 5 Pg of C in the 0-1.0 m layer, which is some 2% of the total C content in Russian soils. From this amount, the topsoil of cropland has lost 2.6 Pg (20% of the initial C content in soils), including 0.4 Pg caused by erosion. The deep soil (0.3-1.0 m) of cropland has lost 1 Pg. Some 0.5 Pg of C are removed from the topsoil (7%) and 0.6 Pg by the deep soil from pastures. Forest soils have roughly lost about 0.3 Pg of C due to the decline of C input into soils caused by various disturbances. The predicted climate warming is expected to enhance the C sequestration by soil in Russia.},

abstract={Coarse-textured surface horizons are common in highly weathered southeastern US coastal plain soils. These soils have historically been managed under conventional tillage practices, but conservation tillage management practices are increasing. Although clay (&lt;2 μm) contents are low in these surface horizons (typically &lt;100 g kg-1), the reactive nature of this fraction tends to play a dominant role in colloidal facilitated pollutant transport. Studies have suggested that enrichment of certain minerals occurs in transported sediments, thus, we evaluated sediment size and the mineralogical partitioning of clay minerals of soil versus runoff sediment under simulated rainfall. In addition, because water dispersible clay (WDC) has been shown to be correlated with soil erodibility, we evaluated WDC differences as a function of tillage practices. Plots were established at a site in the upper coastal plain of central Alabama, where soils classified as coarse-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudults and Typic Hapludults (FAO-Acrisols). Surface tillage treatments were established in 1988, and included conventional tillage (CT) versus no surface tillage (NT) treatments, with crop residue remaining or removed, and with or without paratilling (non-inversion subsoiling). Within these plots, simulated rainfall (target intensity = 50 mm h-1 for 2 h) was applied to replicated 1 m x 1 m areas, and runoff and sediment were collected. Mineralogical analyses of soils and sediment were conducted using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. WDC quantities were highly correlated with percent soil organic carbon (SOC) (r2 = 0.76), which was a function of tillage treatment. Although no differences in the mineralogy of the &lt;2 μm sediment were observed between tillage treatments, runoff sediments (&lt;2 μm) were enriched in quartz (qtz) and relatively depleted with kaolinite compared to in situ soils. These findings will facilitate development of mechanistic models that predict sediment attached losses of nutrients and pesticides.},

abstract={This paper summarizes a six-year study of the Nsimi Small Experimental Watershed (SEW), considered as a model for the South Cameroon humid tropical ecosystem. When this small watershed was set up, no similar survey of input/output hydrobiogeochemical fluxes in granitoid rocks in stable cratonic environment was available, to our knowledge, on any site close to the Equator. Moreover, this is the first attempt, world-wide, to combine different approaches in hydrology, (bio)geochemistry, mineralogy, crystallography, microbiology, geophysics and pedology. Research is based on (1) regular hydrobiogeochemical surveys in various water reservoirs of the SEW ecosystem (atmospheric deposits, groundwater and stream), (2) surveys related either to the organisation and composition of different reservoirs in the superficial layers (basement rocks, saprolite, soils) or to various hydrological, biological and geochemical processes. These surveys aim at (1) finding the main parameters involved in the chemical and physical erosion processes of the humid tropical ecosystem, (2) understanding the source of a particular chemical composition in groundwater and rivers, (3) documenting accurately the different exportation processes of chemical elements in water and soil (4) investigating the possible relation between the biodegradation of soil organic matter and the leaching of metals (especially iron) and (5) comparing the long and short term weathering rates using mass balance calculations. An other important objective of this study is to provide a new scientific and engineering database for the future development of South Cameroon, which is still nowadays a relatively preserved ecosystem. One of the major results is the essential role played by the biological cycle (vegetation and soil organic matter) in the fractionation, exportation or storage of the chemical elements in humid tropical environments. Moreover we are able to propose a model of the current erosion for this SEW from the database obtained on (1) the mineralogy of the basement rocks and the soil layers, (2) the geochemistry of the soluble and colloidal phases of waters and (3) the hydrology within the different reservoirs of the hydrosystem. This model has been confirmed and extended on a regional scale (Nyong river basin). It emphasized the behaviour of the main elements of the tropical soil layers (Fe, Al, Si), the nutrients (C, Ca, Mg, K, Sr) and specific tracers of the weathering processes either with strong mobility (Cl, Na) or on the contrary with an extremely low mobility (Zr, Th, REEs). On the SEW scale, a strong geochemical contrast occurs between the different groundwater zones flooding (1) the hill slope lateritic profiles, (2) the weathering front (interface between the saprolite and the basement rocks), and (3) the swampy zone in which the Mengong brook flows. High DOC contents (15 mg/L) but also high Fe, Th, Al, Zr contents characterize the swampy zone waters. Na and Si have mainly a deep origin (exfiltration), Al, Th, Zr and REEs are strongly linked with colloidal organic matter located in the upper horizons of the swamp. Fe has a much more complex behaviour due to its change of redox state which can be independent of organic matter complexation. Concerning the major base cations, their origin can be constrained by the biological cycle (storage or leaching). K is typically influenced by the biological cycle. During the floods, Cl has the same behaviour as K : it is one of the most striking points of this study. However, the Cl annual budget is balanced. These characteristics can be understood as the consequence of the weathering of the minerals present in the saprolite (kaolinite, goethite, zircon, Th-oxide). This chemical weathering allows the leaching of base cations and also Al and Fe. It has been demonstrated that the microbial populations of the swampy zone can play an important role in the mobilization of transition metals (e.g. Fe). This study point out the role of humic acids in the transport and the weathering budget of elements usually considered as immobile in the superficial cycle (e.g. Al, Th, Zr, Fe). It must be mentioned that worldwide the SEW and even the Nyong network waters are among the least concentrated river waters. It means that even if the organic matter plays an important role in the mobilization and transport of some elements in the swampy zone, its action is limited in term of major cation fluxes on the SEW scale. The reason invoked is that the cation fluxes are directly linked to the pedological history and the geomorphology of the watershed. The presence of thick soil layers composed of saprolite and latosol on the hillsides and of hydromorphic soils in the swampy zone with constant mineralogy lead to isolating the bedrock. The long residence time of water close to the weathering front plays a major role in preserving the parent rock from the hydro-chemical outputs. Moreover, the topsoil layers are stabilized by the vegetation cover, which limits mechanical erosion. This should be taken into account for the carbon mass balance calculation because of the wide areas on stable shields concerned by the humid tropical ecosystems. Moreover, comparison between long and short-term weathering allows us to suggest that paleo-climatic conditions did not change since the Miocene (6-20 Ma) in this part of the world.},

abstract={Isotopes of Be and C were used to reconstruct loess accumulation, hillslope evolution, and agricultural modification in soils of western Iowa. While both elements are derived from additions by the atmosphere (via plants in the case of carbon), the differences in element cycling allow erosional and depositional processes to be separated from biochemical processing. Based on 10Be, loess accumulation likely occurred simultaneously with hillslope degradation. Rates of loess accumulation declined five-fold between early stages (late Pleistocene and early Holocene) and later stages (late Holocene) of accumulation, but the absolute timing of accumulation requires independent dating methods. Based on 14C measurements, plant inputs and decomposition are significant near the surface, but below 1-1.5 m carbon inputs are minimal and decomposition is nearly arrested. The amount of carbon below 1.5 m is constant (0.1%) and is composed of soil organic matter that was buried by loess. Agricultural modification results in a dramatic redistribution of 10Be through soil erosion and deposition. By contrast, the redistribution of soil organic matter is masked by the rapid cycling of C through the topsoil as it continually decomposes and is replaced by plant inputs.},

abstract={The effects of two bed widths (1 and 2 m) and four rainfed cotton-based cropping systems on soil properties, runoff and erosion were evaluated in a Vertisol (1 per cent slope; 21 g per 100 g sand, 12 g per 100 g silt, 67 g per 100 g clay) in subtropical central Queensland, Australia. The cropping systems were: early cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) sown between August and October; wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sown in May, sprayed out and followed by early cotton; wheat allowed to mature, harvested and followed by late cotton sown between October and December; and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) followed by cotton. Land preparation was by minimum tillage and traffic was restricted to the furrows between the beds. Rainfall runoff and soil erosion were monitored with water-height recorders, flumes and troughs. Soil structure was evaluated as air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil in the 0-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45 and 0.45-0.60 m depths. Soil chemical properties measured in the 0-0.15 m depth were organic carbon, pH (in 0.01 M CaCl2), electrical conductivity (EC1:5) of a 1 : 5 soil: water suspension and exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na. In comparison with 1 m beds, 2 m beds resulted in lower runoff and soil erosion, lower exchangeable Na, exchangeable sodium percentage and higher EC1:5/exchangeable Na, higher rate of soil organic matter decrease and better soil structure in the 0-0.15 m depth. Runoff and erosion were reduced, and cotton lint yields increased either by cropping systems sown early to intercept most of the seasonal rainfall or by those which produced a high level of ground cover. Soil physical and chemical properties were best, and runoff and erosion lowest with 2 m beds and cropping systems producing a high level of ground cover. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In the Sahel, promising technologies for agricultural intensification include millet stover mulching and ridging. A four year on-farm experiment was set-up in order to assess the effect of various combinations of these two technologies on soil chemical and physical quality in a millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) - cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) relay intercropping system. Treatments included bare surface, ridging, a surface applied banded millet stover mulch (2 t ha-1) and a banded millet stover mulch (2 t ha-1) buried in ridges. The latter three treatments were implemented exclusively in the rows, with an annual rotation between the millet and cowpea rows. Both the bare and ridge plots experienced a rapid loss of organic carbon, acidification and the development of extensive surface crusts but no increase in bulk density or penetration resistance. In the year of application, mulching improved soil quality in the cowpea row with respect to pH, organic carbon and exchangeable K+ and Mg++ content, penetration resistance and bulk density, and it reduced the decline in exchangeable Ca++ and total N content. In the year following mulch application, a general decline in soil chemical quality was observed in the millet row, except for organic carbon content, and a positive residual effect was observed on penetration resistance and bulk density. As a rule, the effects of mulching in the year of application tended to be stronger in the ridged treatment with buried residue than in the banded surface mulch. In the year following application, this tendency was reversed. For the purpose of reducing soil degradation by nutrient mining and wind erosion, a banded surface mulch therefore appeared more effective than buried mulch.},

abstract={Planting poplars is an effective technology for controlling hill soil erosion in New Zealand pastureland. However, the effects of widely spaced poplars on soil properties are not documented. Soil was sampled from 3 soil depths (0-75, 75-150, and 150-300 mm) in poplar-pasture (PP) and adjacent open pasture (OP) systems. Four sites were examined, 3 unreplicated sites with mature poplars (>29 years, 37-40 stems/ha) and a replicated experiment with immature poplars (5 years, 50-100 stems/ha). Pastures at all sites were dominated by low fertility species and were grazed by sheep and cattle. Pasture species were used in a glasshouse experiment to assess the production potential of the topsoil media (0-20 mm) from the PP and OP soils, and the OP topsoil amended with 5% poplar leaf litter. Soil pH was higher (0.5-1.2 units) in the PP than the OP at all depths, as were exchangeable cations. After 2 months incubation, OP topsoil amended with 5% leaf litter had higher soil pH than the PP or the OP topsoil. Organic C, total N, P or S, and plant-available P or S were similar in the PP and OP soils, or lower in the PP soil. Soil hydraulic characteristics, macroporosity, water aggregate stability, and bulk density were also similar in the PP and OP areas. The differences in the earthworm numbers and mass between the PP and OP areas were inconsistent. Pasture grown in the PP topsoil produced more over 11 months than treatments containing OP topsoil. In addition to increasing the stability and, hence, sustainability of hill soils at risk from erosion, poplar trees enhanced several other key attributes of the soil. The study suggested that poplars have a restoration role by accelerating soil development following the loss of topsoil from an erosion event.},

abstract={Peatlands cover approximately 14% of Scotland, although only part of this area is active (peat-forming) mire. Mires are important for the biodiversity of the specialist plant and animal communities they support. Study of mire ecosystems has revealed intimate relationships between their organic components and water, which mean that it is impossible to understand their ecology without considering hydrology. Whilst ecohydrological studies have concentrated on the internal functioning of mires, the insights gained are relevant to runoff generation in peat-covered river catchments. This paper reviews our knowledge of processes occurring in mires and relates these to wider catchment hydrology, on the basis of published information and recent research in Scotland. The influence of different types of land management is considered, and it emerges that mire is most effective in delaying storm run-off, in preventing soil erosion and in retaining inorganic nutrients when it is undrained; although there can be adverse effects on water quality under certain conditions. In the context of global warming, mire ecosystems are sensitive but at the same time robust to climate change, and thus contain archives of climatic data for the Holocene. Moreover, peatlands store significant quantities of carbon, and influence directly the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Various issues related to conservation and restoration of peatland biodiversity have been addressed constructively in recent decades, although approaches and objectives are not always consistent between sites. These are reviewed, and some outstanding issues and research needs are identified. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The differences in soil properties and crop yield on slopes of varying steepness in intensively cropped paddocks with red ferrosols (Humic Eutrodox), which had evidence of erosion over many years, were determined at 5 sites in north-west Tasmania. We found that soils on the steeper slopes, which have had greater soil loss, had significantly lower topsoil carbon concentrations than soils on flatter slopes. We found that significant redistribution of soil had occurred on the sites in this study. Areas with concave slope positions had over-thickened topsoils. However, the effect of erosion on the topsoil thickness of eroded slope positions was masked by the uniform depth of cultivation across paddocks. Penetration resistance increased gradually with depth on all transects, indicating no compacted layers or plough pans on these intensively cropped sites. Soil physical properties did not significantly change from non-eroded, level areas to steep, eroded parts of the paddocks, even although considerable soil loss had occurred from the steep slopes. We attribute this to the gradational nature of these red ferrosols, which characteristically have strongly structured subsoils. Crop yield was significantly correlated with slope but was not significantly different on land up to 18% slope. We anticipate that continued erosion at current rates on this less steep land will inevitably reduce crop yields. We found a significant correlation between organic carbon, total exchangeable bases, extractable K, and crop yield, but no correlation between available water content and crop yield. We conclude that soil organic matter contributes to productivity through its effect on nutrient concentrations. Total exchangeable bases appeared to provide the best and simplest explanatory model to predict crop yield. We propose a set of 4 tests for future assessment of soil condition on these red ferrosols.},

abstract={The quantification of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in ecosystems is important for (a) understanding changes in ecosystem structure and function with changes in land use, (b) determining the sustainability of ecosystems, and (c) balancing the global C budget as it relates to global climate change. A meso-scale study was conducted to determine regional effects of climate change on C and N cycling within disturbed ecosystems. Objectives of the research were to quantify (a) sediment yield, (b) current C storage in vegetation and soils, and (c) soil C efflux from both abandoned and rehabilitated coal surface-mined lands in Ohio. A dynamic model was developed to simulate sediment yield, grassland production, and C and N cycling on surface-mined lands. Evaluation of plant production and soil erosion submodels with data sets from surface-mined lands in the mid-western U.S. resulted in r2 values of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. Depending on the initial values of soil organic carbon (SOC), model simulations estimated that unvegetated surface-mined lands in Ohio yield approximately 441,325 Mg yr-1 of sediment and emit between 2,000-20,000 Mg yr-1 of C to the atmosphere from decomposition of SOC. While rehabilitated lands had a higher C efflux rate than barren lands, a positive C sequestration rate of 18.4 Mg km-2 yr-1 was estimated as a result of organic matter additions. This sequestion rate increased considerably under projected climate change scenarios, while it decreased when simulated rehabilitated grasslands were harvested for hay. Changes in land use and cover can cause surface-mined lands to be either a net sink or source for C. Successful rehabilitation of mined lands can decrease erosion and promote soil C sequestration, while at the same time providing additional lands for the management of natural resources.},

abstract={Soil quality is a concept based on the premise that management can deteriorate, stabilize, or improve soil ecosystem functions. It is hypothesized that the degree of stratification of soil organic C and N pools with soil depth, expressed as a ratio, could indicate soil quality or soil ecosystem functioning, because surface organic matter is essential to erosion control, water infiltration, and conservation of nutrients. Stratification ratios allow a wide diversity of soils to be compared on the same assessment scale because of an internal normalization procedure that accounts for inherent soil differences. Stratification ratios of soil organic C were 1.1, 1.2 and 1.9 under conventional tillage (CT) and 3.4, 2.0 and 2.1 under no tillage (NT) in Georgia, Texas, and Alberta/British Columbia, respectively. The difference in stratification ratio between conventional and NT within an environment was inversely proportional to the standing stock of soil organic C to a depth of 15-20 cm across environments. Greater stratification of soil C and N pools with the adoption of conservation tillage under inherently low soil organic matter conditions (i.e., Warmer climatic regime or coarse-textured soil) suggests that standing stock of soil organic matter alone is a poor indication of soil quality. Stratification of biologically active soil C and N pools (i.e., soil microbial biomass and potential activity) were equally or more sensitive to tillage, cropping intensity, and soil textural variables than stratification of total C and N. High stratification ratios of soil C and N pools could be good indicators of dynamic soil quality, independent of soil type and climatic regime, because ratios >2 would be uncommon under degraded conditions.

abstract={Soil degradation due to tillage has been reported Africa-wide. Other main causes of soil degradation are overgrazing, extensive cultivation of marginal lands, widespread clearing of vegetation for agriculture, deforestation, exploitation of unsuitable agricultural technologies, mis-management of arable lands, and frequent drought. Hence, declining soil fertility and increasing population pressure on lands are fragile bases on which to build expectations for improyed crop production. This paper recognizes conservation tillage systems as one means for preventing food shortages and natural resources degradation throughout the continent. Conservation tillage has the Potential for increasing soil organic matter content and enhancing soil aggregation. Conservation tillage systems can create an aggregated, fertile surface layer that is important from a soil erosion reduction perspective and thus for a sustainable agriculture in Africa. Some indigenous tillage systems in Africa can be adapted to meet objectives of conservation tillage systems. Further, recent technological developments in tillage and seeding machinery will certainly enhance the rate of farmer's acceptance and adoption of conservation tillage. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Since 1994, water-quality constituents have been measured monthly in three adjacent Coastal Plain watersheds in southwestern Georgia. During 1994, rainfall was 650 mm above annual average and the highest flows on record were observed. From November 1998 through November 2000, 19 months had below average rainfall. Lowest flows on record were observed during the summer of 2000. The watersheds are human-dominated with row-crop agriculture and managed forestlands being the major land uses. However, one watershed (Chickasawhatchee Creek) had 10 to 13% less agriculture and greater wetland area, especially along the stream. Suspended particles, dissolved organic carbon, NH4-N, and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations were greater during wet and flood periods compared with dry and drought periods for each stream. Regional hydrologic conditions had little effect on NO3-N or dissolved inorganic carbon. Chickasawhatchee Creek had significantly lower suspended sediment and NO3-N concentrations and greater organic and inorganic carbon concentrations, reflecting greater wetland area and stronger connection to a regional aquifer system. Even though substantial human land use occurred within all watersheds, water quality was generally good and can be attributed to low stream drainage density and relatively intact floodplain forests. Low drainage density minimizes surface runoff into streams. Floodplain forests reduce nonpoint-source pollutants through biological and physical absorption. In addition to preserving water quality, floodplain forests provide important ecological functions through the export of nutrients and organic carbon to streams. Extreme low flows may be disruptive to aquatic life due to both the lack of water and to the scarcity of biologically important materials originating from floodplain forests.},

abstract={Recent concerns about CO2 emissions and global warming have prompted renewed interest in using corn stover for energy production. Lack of markets, concerns about sustained soil productivity, and lack of commercial conversion technologies have precluded the widespread harvest of corn residues for this purpose. This paper reviews existing literature to evaluate the major environmental impacts potentially associated with stover harvest from reduced tillage corn production sites. Issues of greatest concern are erosion and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, the latter both for its role in soil quality and yield and for global carbon cycle implications. About half of the literature examined concerned research in the United States, many publications described research activities conducted for decades, and major soil types in corn producing regions were well represented. Regional differences were primarily temperature and rainfall effects on stand establishment and yield, with potential feedback effects on SOC. Several research papers discussing the effects of residue harvest were found, but few field studies were found that explicitly studied the effects of corn stover harvest and most discussions acknowledge potential tradeoffs among beneficial and adverse effects. It was concluded that more information is needed on several topics to determine potential long-term effects of residue harvest, including (1) erosion and water quality, especially pesticides and nitrate, (2) rates of transformation of different forms of SOC, (3) effects on soil biota, and (4) SOC dynamics in the subsoil. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Water erosion results in the mobilization and depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC), but studies providing direct experimental evidence of eroded C mineralization and its linkage to the global C cycle are lacking. A study was conducted to determine the mineralization of SOC in runoff from a southwestern Ohio Crosby soil (fine, mixed, mesic Aeric Ochraqualf) that had been under no-till (NT), chisel till (CT) and moldboard plow (MP) for 38 years. To simulate present and future soil erosion conditions, the 0-3 and 5-8 cm soil layers from triplicate soil blocks extracted from each tillage practice were used. Soil layers were transferred to runoff trays and simulated rainfall (30 ± 5 mm h-1) was applied for 1 h. Runoff was collected at 20, 40 and 60 min following initiation of rainfall event. Carbon dioxide production was monitored for 100 days in runoff samples incubated without and with N (0.15-0.20 g NH4-N kg-1 sediment) amendment to simulate situations where water erosion coincides with high soil mineral N availability. The data show that soil layer depth and time of runoff sampling had no significant effect on any of the parameters considered. Sediment delivery (g sediment m-2 h-1) was significantly lower in the NT (17.4) than in the other tillage (CT: 48.9, MP: 34.1) practices; it was inversely related to degree of soil aggregation and sediment C content. The average of C export ranged between 0.6 and 1.1 g C m-2 h-1, and was highest in the CT soil. Mineralization of runoff C followed a first-order kinetics and proceeded at rates significantly higher in NT and N-amended runoff. Nearly half of the total runoff C mineralization recorded during the entire incubation occurred during the first 20 days suggesting that under field conditions, most of the erosion-induced CO2 production will occur in the days immediately following rainfall events. Potentially mineralizable carbon (C0) in runoff was significantly greater with NT (13.5 g C kg-1 sediment) than with the other tillage practices, and was positively correlated with sediment C content (R2= 0.76) and cumulative C mineralized (R2 = 0.77-0.97). The data presented showed that 29-35 and 33-46% of the C exported in runoff was mineralized in 100 days without and with N amendment, respectively. These results are the first quantitative evidence that a significant fraction of the SOC released through water erosion is mineralizable and, therefore represents an additional source of atmospheric CO2. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Re-Os analyses were performed on five soil profiles developed on silicate lithologies in the Narayani drainage basin of the Himalayas, as well as on several altered black shales and associated alteration phases. The results indicate that all of these samples have lost large amounts of Re. This Re loss approached 100% in the black shale-derived soils, which also most probably lost substantial quantities of Os. The near constancy of Os and Re concentrations with depth indicates that this loss occurred quite early in the alteration process, rather than progressively during the course of soil development. A slight decrease in 187Os/188Os was observed toward the surface of the two black shale soil profiles, possibly indicating a minor preferential mobility of radiogenic 187Os for this lithology. In the black shale-derived saprolite and soils, the loss of Re and Os was related to the loss of organic carbon. The importance of this phase is underscored by the fact that organic material separated from a black shale sample accounted for nearly all of the Os contained in the whole rock. Analysis of alteration phases from the surface of a weathered black shale showed that Os liberated during alteration was partially reprecipitated in Fe oxides, with Os isotopic compositions very similar to that of the original rock, whereas Re was removed with the fluid phase. These results demonstrate the disproportionately large role that black shale weathering may play in determining the Re and Os contents of continental runoff and, thus, ultimately of seawater, but they also emphasize the possible complexity of this process. The data suggest that a large fraction of the Os contained in black shales is released during chemical alteration, which is apparently not the case for most other silicate rocks. Therefore, the potential contribution of black shales to the dissolved Os budget of runoff and river water may be even greater than that expected from the high Os concentrations of these rocks. The extent to which this Os will affect the seawater Os composition depends on how efficiently it is recaptured by secondary phases such as Fe-Mn oxides in situ or during transport. These results also underscore the high mobility of Re with respect to Os at every stage in the erosional process, thus explaining the order of magnitude increase in Re/Os ratio from the black shale source rocks to seawater.

abstract={Soil organic carbon (SOC) in Canadian agricultural soils plays an important role in the global cycle of C, and management can influence its fate. Although the scientific literature suggests that practicing no-till (NT) can sequester C, this is not always the case. Furthermore, there are many other factors including climate, management history, soil type and soil landscape processes that may affect the dynamics of SOC under NT. We measured the changes in SOC under NT in southern Ontario, at varying positions in the landscape in Gleyic and Orthic Luvisols at the end of a 15-year-period. Soil cores taken to depths beyond the solum, were segmented with depth, and total SOC was determined for each segment on an equivalent mass basis. When the entire soil column was considered, there was a loss of SOC in more profiles than there were gains. Furthermore, the erosion/deposition history at each landscape position appeared to influence the dynamics of SOC. In depression areas where Ap horizons were greater than 27 cm thick due to a history of soil deposition from upslope and local hydrology, there was a loss of total SOC after 15 years of NT. While where the Ap thickness was less than 27 cm, there were 18 profiles with SOC gains and 15 with net losses. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the change in SOC after 15 years was negatively related to the initial total SOC content and positively related to mass of clay. The results of this study suggest that landscape position and erosion/deposition history play a significant role in the ability of NT soils to sequester SOC. Interpretations of long-term SOC monitoring studies must take into account the location of samples within fields if useful information is to be gained on C dynamics in agricultural soils. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Continuous cultivation of soils of the semiarid tropics has led to significant land degradation. Soil erosion and nutrient loss caused by high runoff volumes have reduced crop yields and contributed to offsite damage. We compared a number of soil management practices (tillage, mulch and perennial/annual rotational based systems) for their potential to improve crop production and land resource protection in an Alfisol of the semiarid tropics of India. Runoff and soil erosion were monitored and surface soil and sediment were analysed for nitrogen and carbon to determine enrichment ratios. Amelioration of soils with organic additions (farmyard manure, rice straw) or rotating perennial pasture with annual crops increased soil carbon and nitrogen contents and reduced runoff, soil erosion and nutrient loss. Soil erosion totalled less than 7t ha-1, but enrichment ratios were often greater than 2 resulting in up to 27kg N ha-1 and 178 kg C ha-1 being lost in sediment. Up to an extra 250mm of water per year infiltrated the soil with organic additions and was available for crop water use or percolation to groundwater. The results show that there are good opportunities for reducing degradation and increasing productivity on farms.},

abstract={Investigations were conducted on both the annual patterns of earthworm casting activity and the annual variations in soil and phosphorus (P) transfers by water runoff, under a temperate maize crop, to determine whether there is any time synchronism over the year between these processes that could increase risk of soil erosion. Cast dynamics were measured at 15-day intervals for 1 year. Phosphorus forms were determined in runoff waters and the sediments collected were analyzed for nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and P contents. As long as there was no crust at the soil surface, no runoff was observed. Once the sealing crust formed, the soil erosion began. After the rainstorm events in August, soil erosion already reached 70% of the total soil loss that occurred over the crop year. A total of 140 g m-2 year-1 of sediment was lost by the end of the year. A time synchronization was observed between tillage practices and highest cast productions over the year, which were then interrupted for up to 5 weeks after both ploughing and crop harvest. In particular, the absence of anecic casts onto the soil till September underline that Lumbricus terrestris was most affected by ploughing. The likelihood that earthworm casts contributed to soil erosion was enforced by the correlation between the timing of cast disappearance and the increase in sediment transfers for rainstorm events observed in summer, as well as for long rainy period in fall/winter. However, we could not outline a systematic correlation over the year but just for defined periods. Particulate soil erosion and P amounts in runoff waters decreased (55-2 g m-2, and 19-5 mg of P losses m-2, respectively) through the crop year. However, the content of organic matter in sediment increased (2.54-5.16%) compared to the initial soil (1.8%), as well as the P concentration (1.1-1.6 mg g-1). © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Spatial distribution of chlorinated hydrocarbons [chlorinated pesticides (CPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was measured in riverine and estuarine sediment samples from Pearl River Delta, China, collected in 1997. Concentrations of CPs of the riverine sediment samples range from 12 to 158 ng/g, dry weight, while those of PCBs range from 11 to 486 ng/g. The CPs concentrations of the estuarine sediment samples are in the range 6-1658 ng/g, while concentrations of PCBs are in the range 10-339 ng/g. Total PAH concentration ranges from 1168 to 21,329 ng/g in the riverine sediment samples, whereas the PAH concentration ranges from 323 to 14,812ng/g in the sediment samples of the Estuary. Sediment samples of the Zhujiang River and Macao harbor around the Estuary show the highest concentrations of CPs, PCBs, and PAHs. Possible factors affecting the distribution patterns are also discussed based on the usage history of the chemicals, hydrologic condition, and land erosion due to urbanization processes. The composition of PAHs is investigated and used to assess petrogenic, combustion and naturally derived PAHs of the sediment samples of the Pearl River Delta. In addition, the concentrations of a number of organic compounds of the Pearl River Delta samples indicate that sediments of the Zhujiang river and Macao harbor are most likely to pose biological impairment. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={The first and possibly only major rise of atmospheric oxygen, from po2 ≤ 0.1% PAL (the present atmospheric level) to po2 ≥ 10% PAL, appears to have occured sometime before 2 Ga ago, although the exact time of and the cause(s) for the rise have been hotly debated. Equally important questions on the atmospheric oxygen concern its stability, especially the mechanisms regulating the atmospheric po2 level and the causes and magnitude of po2 variations since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen. Previous efforts to model the po2 variation during the Phanerozoic time have typically relied on secondary information, such as the carbon and sulfur isotopic records of sedimentary rocks, and on simple dynamics of the geochemical cycles of O,C, S, and P based on box-type models. As a result, many kinetic questions about the variation and stability of atmospheric oxygen could not have been answered. Here we quantitatively evaluate the dynamics and stability of atmospheric O2 and CO2 using recent experimental data, field observations, and a new model for the C-O coupled geochemical cycles. We examine the change with time in the fluxes of various compounds (O2, CO2, phosphate, organic C, carbonate C, C-bearing reduced volcanic gases, and C-free reduced volcanic gases) among the various reservoirs (atmosphere, soil, surface ocean, deep ocean, the lower crust and mantle, and upper crust) under a variety of scenarios. Our model does not assume steady-state fluxes for any of the reservoirs. Rather, the model incorporates the kinetic experimental data on oxidation of coal, a proxy for kerogen, the dynamics of soil formation and erosion, the kinetics of decomposition of organic matter in the Oceans by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, the equilibrium ocean-atmosphere carbonate model, the observed relationships among the organic burial flux, dissolved O2 content of deep ocean, and sedimentation rates, and the three-box model ocean. The important parameters that strongly influence the dynamics of atmospheric O2, are found to be (a) the total area of soil formation on Earth; (b) the average soil depth; (c) the average rate of physical erosion of soils, which is linked to the average rate of accumulation of clastic sediments in the oceans; (d) the composition and flux of volcanic gas; and (e) the level of atmospheric CO2. We develop kinetic equations linking these parameters to the production and consumption fluxes of atmospheric oxygen and also to stable po2 values. Considering the likely ranges of variations in these parameters in geologic history, we suggest that the atmospheric po2 level is likely to have stayed within a very narrow range of 0.6-2 PAL and that the entire ocean, except for local euxinic basins, is likely to have been basically oxygenated since the first major rise of atmospheric oxygen more than 2 Ga ago.

Ghiorso APPENDIX The dependence of the experimental rate of oxidation of coal on the square root of the oxygen concentration is a significant result. As such, it is important to justify the rate law based on what is known from surface chemical kinetics. gives a probable mechanism that accounts for the square-root dependence of the rate. The first step involves molecular adsorption of the O Figure 14 2 molecule on the organic surface. The adsorbed O 2 molecules can then use the organic substrate to dissociate into adsorbed oxygen atoms [step (2)]. Such dissociation has been commonly observed with diatomic molecules on solid surfaces (Lasaga, 1998) . These adsorbed oxygen atoms can also recombine to form adsorbed oxygen molecules, thereby leading to an equilibrium relationship [step (2)]. The slow step in the oxidation involves the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bonds and the formation of CO by the reactive adsorbed oxygen atoms [step (3)]. The CO products are quickly oxidized to CO 2 [step (4)]. The rate-determining step is proportional to the concentration of adsorbed oxygen atoms [Eqn. (A1)]. But from the previous equilibrium relationship between adsorbed oxygen molecules and adsorbed oxygen atoms [step (2)], the concentration of adsorbed oxygen atoms is proportional to the square root of the adsorbed oxygen molecules [Eqn. (A2)]. If the adsorbed oxygen molecules are linearly related to the amount of oxygen in the fluid, the overall rate has a square-root dependence on p O 2 [Eqn. A3)]. Such square-root dependencies have been observed in other heterogeneous reaction mechanisms (e.g., Lasaga, 1998) . We add the possible mechanism here because it has not been presented in this regard by Chang and Berner (1999) . Note that the mechanism proposed for the experimental data is independent of any bacterial action. Also note that the mechanism would apply even if some of the intermediate oxidation products are complex humic substances, as observed in part by Chang and Berner. Finally, the mechanism assumes that the oxygen molecules obey a linear adsorption isotherm, which is consistent with other studies of neutral diatomics on crystal surfaces (Lasaga, 1998) .},

abstract={Organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and stable isotope ratios (δ13C, δ15N) of fine (&lt;50 μm) size fractions of deep-sea sediments from the central North Atlantic were employed to identify changes in sources of organic matter over the past 50 ka BP. Ambient glacial sediments are characterised by values that reflect mixtures of marine and terrestrial inputs (averages ± 1 σ: OC/TN = 7.6 ± 0.8; δ13C = -22.8 ± 1.0‰; δ15N = 5.5 ± 0.6‰). δ13C, OC, and TN concentrations shift to higher values during the Holocene, indicating a gradual decrease of fine terrigenous supply to the North Atlantic. The unchanged δ15N record between last glacial and Holocene stages indicates that the central North Atlantic region remained oligotrophic at least during the past 50 ka BP, but additional studies are required to support this result in terms of nitrogen oceanic budget. During the phases of enhanced ice-rafted detrital supply corresponding to prominent Heinrich events (HL1, HL2, HL4, and HL5), fine-sized sedimentary organic matter has lower OC and TN concentrations, contrasting sharply with those of ambient glacial sediments. Lower δ13C (down to -28‰) and δ15N (down to 1.6‰) values and high OC:TN ratios (up to 14.7 ± 1.1) are found for HL1, HL2, and with lesser extent for HL4. These values reflect enhanced detrital supply originating from poorly differentiated soil horizons that characterise periglacial climate conditions and from organic matter-bearing rock sources of the underlying geological basement. During HL5, only the δ13C offset records the input of fine size ice-rafted organic matter. Gradually changing soil development conditions during the time interval covering HL5 to HL1 (marine isotope stages 5 to 2), as well as varying erosion levels, have been hypothesized on the basis of constant δ13C, increasing OC/TN and decreasing δ15N values.

abstract={Thick laminar calcrete profiles are common on the surface of the eastern Canary Islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. This paper reports the study of one profile from Lanzarote (Macher profile) and one from Fuerteventura (Tefía profile). These profiles are about 2 m thick. The Macher profile is developed on basaltic host rocks and consists of two main horizons: a lower horizon in which white veins of laminated micrite penetrate cracks, and an upper laminar horizon. The Tefía profile is cumulative and consists, from base to top, of massive, laminar, and massive and laminar-brecciated horizons. Highlighted in the study of these profiles are the presence of ooids, the complex structure of the laminar horizons, and the occurrence of fossil bee nests (Celliforma). Ooids consist of a nucleus of clay, micrite and etched grains coated with envelopes of micrite and clay (mainly palygorskite). Organic films favoured both the precipitation of carbonate and the adhesion of clays when the ooids formed in the soil. The laminar horizons consist of a centimetre-scale alternation of massive micrite with varied amounts of ooids and detrital grains with laminated micrite. This alternation indicates the small-scale periods of sedimentation, erosion and soil formation in the upper part of a relatively stable surface. These small-scale alternations may reflect climatic vegetation changes in which arid periods are represented by micrite with ooids, while laminated micrite reflects a better-developed vegetation of the wet periods. Celliforma occur as ovoid larval cells with more or less rounded bases and a flat top. The cells are about 3 cm long and 1.5 cm in diameter. Their wall is about 5 mm thick, and is commonly laminated. Celliforma is interpreted as fossil nests of solitary bees. Their presence in the laminar horizon is evidence for the existence of a vegetation cover containing angiosperms. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.},

abstract={Maintaining and/or conserving organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in the soil using management practices can improve its fertility and productivity and help to reduce global warming by sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and N2. We examined the influence of 6 years of tillage (no-till, NT; chisel plowing, CP; and moldboard plowing, MP), cover crop (hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) vs. winter weeds), and N fertilization (0, 90, and 180kg N ha-1) on soil organic C and N concentrations in a Norfolk sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic, Typic Kandiudults) under tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and silage corn (Zea mays L.). In a second experiment, we compared the effects of 7 years of non-legume (rye (Secale cereale L.)) and legume (hairy vetch and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.)) cover crops and N fertilization (HN (90 kg N ha-1 for tomato and 80 kg N ha-1 for eggplant)) and FN (180 kg N ha-1 for tomato and 160 kg N ha-1 for eggplant)) on soil organic C and N in a Greenville fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic, Rhodic Kandiudults) under tomato and eggplant (Solanum melogena L.). Both experiments were conducted from 1994 to 2000 in Fort Valley, GA. Carbon concentration in cover crops ranged from 704 kg ha-1 in hairy vetch to 3704 kg ha-1 in rye in 1999 and N concentration ranged from 77 kg ha-1 in rye in 1996 to 299 kg ha-1 in crimson clover in 1997. With or without N fertilization, concentrations of soil organic C and N were greater in NT with hairy vetch than in MP with or without hairy vetch (23.5-24.9 vs. 19.9-21.4 Mg ha-1 and 1.92-2.05 vs. 1.58-1.76 Mg ha-1, respectively). Concentrations of organic C and N were also greater with rye, hairy vetch, crimson clover, and FN than with the control without a cover crop or N fertilization (17.5-18.4 vs. 16.5 Mg ha-1 and 1.33-1.43 vs. 1.31 Mg ha-1, respectively). From 1994 to 1999, concentrations of soil organic C and N decreased by 8-16% in NT and 15-25% in CP and MP. From 1994 to 2000, concentrations of organic C and N decreased by 1% with hairy vetch and crimson clover, 2-6% with HN and FN, and 6-18% with the control. With rye, organic C and N increased by 3-4%. Soil organic C and N concentrations can be conserved and/or maintained by reducing their loss through mineralization and erosion, and by sequestering atmospheric CO2 and N2 in the soil using NT with cover crops and N fertilization. These changes in soil management improved soil quality and productivity. Non-legume (rye) was better than legumes (hairy vetch and crimson clover) and N fertilization in increasing concentrations of soil organic C and N. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils is controlled by the balance of added organic residues and microbial oxidation of both residues and native organic matter (OM) as moderated by management and tillage. The PC-based model CQESTR predicts decomposition of residues, organic amendments and soil OM, based on cropping practices. CQESTR uses RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) crop rotation and management practice, crop production, and operation databases. These data are supplemented with residue nitrogen and soil OM, bulk density, and layer thickness. CQESTR was calibrated with soil carbon data from 70-year-long experiments at the Research Center at Pendleton, OR. The calibrated model provides estimates with a 95% confidence interval of 0.33% OM. Validation at 11 independent sites resulted in a matching of observed with calculated OM with a 95% confidence interval of 0.55% OM. A 12th site, with a history of severe erosion, provided a poor match. Copyright © 2001 .},

abstract={The USA has about 336 Mha of grazing lands of which rangelands account for 48%. Changes in rangeland soil C can occur in response to a wide range of management and environmental factors. Grazing, fire, and fertilization have been shown to affect soil C storage in rangelands, as has converting marginal croplands into grasslands. Carbon losses due to soil erosion can influence soil C storage on rangelands both by reducing soil productivity in source areas and potentially increasing it in depositional areas, and by redistributing the C to areas where soil organic matter mineralization rates are different. Proper grazing management has been estimated to increase soil C storage on US rangelands from 0.1 to 0.3 Mg C ha-1year-1 and new grasslands have been shown to store as much as 0.6 Mg C ha-1year-1. Grazing lands are estimated to contain 10-30% of the world's soil organic carbon. Given the size of the C pool in grazing lands we need to better understand the current and potential effects of management on soil C storage. Copyright © 2001 .},

abstract={Soil erosion from agricultural lands causes loss of soil productivity, as well as environmental problems down stream due to sediment and contaminants sorbed on dispersed colloids. In order to estimate the potential effects of erosion and to describe the behavior of various inorganic and organic contaminants in agro-ecosystems, quantitative characterization of soil colloid dispersion is essential. The effect of long-term tillage management (conventional-tillage and no-tillage) on mineralogical and organic carbon content in both field- and laboratory-generated water dispersible particles (WDP) were studied. Field-WDP were collected during rainfall simulation. Laboratory-WDP were obtained by shaking soil for 16 hours (soil to water ratio of 1:10). Results demonstrate that laboratory- and field-WDP differ in organic carbon content, particle size distribution, and mineralogical concentrations, and are influenced by soil management. Soils under no-tillage produced much larger amounts of laboratory-WDP and smaller amounts of field-WDP than the soils under conventional-tillage. Field-WDP from both no-tillage and conventional-tillage fields were dominated by silt-sized particles, while laboratory-WDP dominated in the clay-sized fraction. Both organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon concentration in field-WDP runoff decreased with time during simulated rainfall events. The laboratory procedure used here for generating water-dispersible particles may not be suitable for studying runoff sediments in the field.},

abstract={Field production of ornamental shrubs often results in significant topsoil removal and degradation of surface soil physical properties. Building soil organic matter through compost amendments is one way to ameliorate effects from topsoil removal in woody ornamentals production. We amended field soils with three composts to evaluate their effects on soil physical properties and shrub biomass production. Specifically, we applied either duck manure-sawdust (DM), potato cull-sawdust-dairy manure (PC) or paper mill sludge-bark (PMB) composts to a Plano silt loam soil using two application methods: 2.5 cm of compost incorporated into the top 15 cm of soil (incorporated-only) or 2.5 cm of compost incorporated plus 2.5 cm of compost applied over the soil surface (mulched). We grew three shrub species from liners: Spirea japonicum 'Gumball', Juniper chinensis 'Pfitzeriana', and Berberis thunbergia 'Atropurpurea'. Shrub species and soil amendment treatments were established in triplicate in a randomized split plot design. Total soil carbon (TC), bulk density (pb), aggregate stability, soil moisture retention capacity (MRC), volumetric moisture content (θv), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) were measured over three years (1998 to 2000). We measured above and below ground shrub dry matter production at the end of the first (1998) and second (1999) growing seasons. Mulched treatments resulted in 15%-21% higher TC than the incorporated-only and no-amendment control treatments. Bulk density decreased with increasing TC contents. Greater aggregate stability and the formation of larger aggregates were related to increased TC. Field moisture retention capacity tended to be higher in the incorporated treatments compared to the mulched and nonamended control treatments. Compost amended treatments increased saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) sevenfold over the nonamended control. There were no compost effects on shrub biomass until the second year of growth. Barberry was the only species to respond significantly and positively to compost application. Specifically, mulched DM compost produced 39-42% greater total Barberry biomass than the other compost treatments and the nonamended control. Our findings showed that compost effects on soil physical properties differed among composts and their subsequent effects on shrub growth were species specific.},

abstract={Twenty-one benchmark soils of the United States, including surface and subsurface horizons and satellites, from the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) were analyzed for phosphorus (P), using methods that include total (TP), water-soluble (WP), Bray 1 (BP), Mehlich No. 3 (MP), Olsen (OLP), New Zealand P Retention (NZP), organic (OP), anion exchange resin (AEP), and acid oxalate (Po). Objectives of this study were to determine relationships among soil P test values and other soil properties. Knowledge and understanding of these relationships are important to researchers when evaluating soil P data sets for use in predictive models for agronomic, soil genesis, or environmental purposes. Important relationships that were developed, using simple or multiple linear regression models, among P methods and other soil properties, e.g., organic carbon (OC), total N (TN), dithionitecitrate extractable iron and aluminum (Fed, Ald), and clay are as follows.},

abstract={Recent modeling studies indicate that soil erosion and terrestrial sedimentation may establish ecosystem disequilibria that promote carbon (C) sequestration within the biosphere. Movement of upland eroded soil into wetland systems with high net primary productivity may represent the greatest increase in storage capacity potential for C sequestration. The capacity of wetland systems to capture sediments and build up areas of deposition has been documented as well as the ability of these ecosystems to store substantial amounts of C. The purpose of our work was to assess rates of sediment deposition and C storage in a wetland site adjacent to a small first-order stream that drains an agricultural area. The soils of the wetland site consist of a histosol buried by sediments from the agricultural area. Samples of deposited sediments in the riparian zone were collected in 5 cm increments and the concentration of 137Cs was used to determine the 1964 and 1954 deposition layers. Agricultural activity in the watershed has caused increased sediment deposition to the wetland. The recent upland sediment is highly enriched in organic matter indicating that large amounts of organic C have been sequestered within this zone of sediment deposition. Rates of sequestration are much higher than rates that have occurred over the pre-modern history of the wetland. These data indicate the increased sedimentation rates in the wetland ecosystem are associated with increased C sequestration rates. Copyright © 2001 .},

abstract={The depth distribution of 137Cs (cesium-137) and its relationship with organic carbon and different particle size fractions in Haplic-Udic Ferrosols in Yujiang, Southern China, are described in this paper. Compared with other sites, the lower 137Cs inventories associated with uncultivated soils on or close to the crests indicate the relatively low 137Cs in situ retention ability of the soil. Therefore, the use of 137Cs techniques in erosion studies on uncultivated Haplic-Udic Ferrosols may create some significant difficulties and limitations, including identifying the suitable 137Cs reference site and its validity on and near the crests. The impact of the soil erosion process to a depth of more than 4 to 6 cm on the sloping dry farmland and dry terrace farmland indicates that the widely accepted assumption of uniform 137Cs depth distribution within the plough layer may not apply in these soils, although it does basically hold true for the paddy terrace field, in the area dominated by Haplic-Udic Ferrosols. For uncultivated Haplic-Udic Ferrosols, the organic matter may not control the downward migration of 137Cs because no significant relationship was found between the depth distribution of 137Cs and that of organic matter. It was also demonstrated that the 137Cs fallout is associated mainly with the clay fraction, whereas the organic matter is associated mainly with the silt fraction. For Haplic-Udic Ferrosols, the water-induced erosion removes preferentially the clay associated with the relatively high concentration of 137Cs and low content of organic matter.},

abstract={The elemental and isotopic composition of particulate and dissolved organic matter was investigated in the Piracicaba River basin, São Paulo State, Brazil. Comparison of riverine organic matter from the Piracicaba River basin, a region where rivers and streams receive urban sewage and industrial effluents, with data reported for the pristine Amazon system revealed significant differences associated with anthropogenic impacts. One important difference was N enrichment in the particulate organic material of the Piracicaba basin rivers, due to (a) urban and industrial effluents, and (b) enhanced phytoplankton growth, which results from the combination of nutrient enrichment and damming of sections of the rivers. Radiocarbon concentrations were overall more depleted (older 14C age) in the Piracicaba basin rivers than in the Amazon, which may reflect the importance of soil erosion in the former. Analyses of stable and radioactive carbon isotopes and lignin-derived compounds indicated that coarse particulate organic material is composed of a mixture of soil particles and degraded organic matter from C3 and C4 vascular plants. Fine particulate organic material was composed mainly of soil particles and phytoplankton cell remains, the latter especially during low water. Ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter was the most degraded fraction according to its lignin oxidation products, and showed the greatest influence of C4 plant sources. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Site-specific forestry requires detailed characterization of the spatial distribution of forest soil properties and the magnitude of harvesting impacts in order to prescribe appropriate management schemes. Furthermore, evaluation of the effects of timber harvesting on soil properties conducted on a landscape scale improves the interpretive value of soil survey data. Questions exist regarding the extent and spatial distribution of the effects of timber harvesting on eroded soils of the Alabama Piedmont. We evaluated the impacts of clear-cut harvesting on the temporal and spatial variability of bulk density (ρb), soil strength, and water content (θg) at three sites in the Alabama Piedmont where timber was predominantly mature plantation stands of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Pre-harvest spatial variability of texture, surface horizon thickness, and soil organic carbon (SOC) within single soil mapping delineations was also evaluated. Soils were moderately to severely eroded and classified in fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic and Rhodic Kanhapludult and Kandiudult families. Although significant increases (P &lt; 0.05) in ρb were observed after timber harvesting for some of the trafficking class-depth interval combinations at all sites, the largest increases were observed at the moderately eroded site. Harvesting timber increased soil strength by 25.1% on the moderately eroded site, with increases occurring to a 40-cm depth in skid trails. Results suggested the degree of harvesting impacts were erosion phase dependent, with greater impacts on moderately versus severely eroded soils. Geostatistical analyses indicated that pre-harvest % clay and surface thickness were more highly spatially correlated than pre-harvest SOC, which may be related to erosion processes. Analyses also suggested harvesting slightly increased the overall spatial variablity of ρb, soil strength, and θg. These results suggest that the establishment of site-specific forest tillage zones to ameliorate compaction may be impractical to implement because of the increases in spatial variability of these properties.},

abstract={Pistacia atlantica trees have a very limited distribution in wadis in the central Negev highlands, and erosive processes may have a negative impact on the recruitment and survival of the trees. We measured the sizes of the trunks of adult trees, the condition of their canopies, fruit density, insect herbivory, and soil parameters - both in eroded and noneroded habitats. This was to determine the habitat soil quality and how it relates to the demographic disposition and vitality of these trees. The results revealed irregular size/age distribution and possible poor recruitment. There were no differences in fruit density between trees in eroded and noneroded habitats. However, analysis on gall density per branch revealed that Slavum wertheimae prefer host plants in relatively uneroded habitats. Analysis of water-holding capacity, soil organic carbon content, and pH revealed significant differences, with better soil quality existing in noneroded areas.},

abstract={An index to benchmark pesticide mobility relevant to surface water runoff and soil erosion (surface water mobility index, or SWMI) was derived based on two key environmental fate parameters: degradation half-life and organic carbon-normalized soil/water sorption coefficient (Ko-c). Values assigned with the index of each individual compound correlate well with the concentration trend of 13 pesticides monitored in six Lake Erie, USA, tributaries from 1983 to 1991. Regression using a power function of SWMI fits concentration data well at various percentiles in the database for each tributary and all six tributaries combined, with r2 ranging from 0.71 to 0.94 for the concentrations at the 95th percentile. Good agreement was also obtained between SWMI and the time-weighted annual mean concentrations (r2 = 0.67-0.87). Although concentrations at or near peaks tend to be driven by rare hydrological events (intense precipitation immediately after application), SWMI explains the peak concentration data generally well (r2 = 0.53-0.86). The SWMI-concentration relationship was further evaluated with two other pesticide monitoring databases: the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment Program White River Study Unit (1991-1996) at Hazelton, Indiana, USA, and the Syngenta (previously Novartis) Voluntary Monitoring Program with Community Water Systems at the Higginsville City Lake, Missouri, USA (1995-1997). The ability of the proposed SWMI to discriminate pesticide runoff mobility and its correlation with surface water monitoring data can be significant in the development of screening methodologies and data-based models for government agencies and/or practitioners in general facing increasing pressure to assess pesticide occurrence in aquatic environments.},

abstract={A 4000-yr sediment core record from Lake Salpetén, Guatemala, provides evidence for Maya-induced forest clearance and consequent soil erosion between ∼1700 cal yr B.C. and 850 cal yr A.D. Radiocarbon ages of wood, seeds, and charcoal support an age-depth model with average errors of ± 110 cal yr. Relatively low carbonate δ18O values between 1300 and 400 cal yr B.C. coincide with pollen evidence for forest loss, consistent with increased surface and groundwater flow to the lake. Minimum δ18O values between 400 cal yr B.C. and 150 cal yr A.D. suggest a high lake level, as do 14C-dated aquatic gastropods as much as 7.5 m above the present lake stage. High lake levels resulted from reduced evaporation-to-precipitation ratios, increased hydrologic input caused by anthropogenic deforestation, or both. The Preclassic abandonment (150 A.D.) and Early Classic/Late Classic boundary (550 A.D.) are marked by relatively high δ18O values indicating reduced lake levels. Oxygen isotope composition increased further coincident with the Terminal Classic Maya demographic decline between 800 and 900 A.D. This period of high δ18O may have been caused by the greater aridity that has been documented in northern Yucatán lakes or by decreased hydrologic input to the lake as a consequence of forest recovery. Reduced soil erosion after 850 cal yr A.D. coincided with the Terminal Classic Maya demographic decline and permitted forest recovery and resumption of organic sedimentation. © 2002 University of Washington.},

abstract={Drained and cutover peatlands represent a persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Contemporary, intermediate, and long-term rates of peat oxidation were measured in an abandoned cutover peatland to estimate the mass of C lost in order to determined if the oxidation rate has changed with time since abandonment. Contemporary rates were measured six times per week at 25 locations within the peatland using a portable infrared gas analyzer and an enclosure system. Mean daily peat oxidation was 7.7 g CO2 m-2 d-1 or 4.8 mm yr-1. Intermediate (2-13 yr) oxidation rates were estimated using dendrochronological techniques. Over 325 birch (Betula spp.) shrubs, an invasive group of species in abandoned cutover peatlands, were removed from the peatland after measuring the distance to the existing peat surface from the collar of the trunk. Dating the birches permitted the determination of the rate of peat oxidation and erosion since the establishment of individuals. Long-term oxidation (19 yr) was estimated with over 10 000 measurements on exposed stable tree stumps. The mean intermediate and long-term oxidation rates were 6.2 ± 2.9 mm yr-1 and 5.7 ± 1.1 mm yr-1, respectively. These results suggest that peat oxidation rates remain high even after two decades of post-extraction abandonment. Since oxidation is an irreversible process, these results carry important implications for restoration work as well as for the determination of the long-term source of atmospheric CO2.},

The results show that as inadequate management affects the soil quality, so soil evaluation prior to land management is important.},

abstract={Restoration of degraded soils with organic wastes could be a feasible practice to minimise erosion in the Mediterranean area. In this work we have applied three different organic wastes to three different soils of degraded areas. Two composted and one uncomposted sewage sludges were used for the restoration of soils. The soils were: one soil of overexploited agricultural area, one burned forest soil, and one shrub-land soil degraded by environmental conditions (annual rainfall ∼300 mm) and erosion. The experiment was carried out in field conditions. After the addition of organic amendments, some soil samplings were made. Different soil properties were determined: physical (aggregate stability %), chemical (pH, salinity, available nutrients) and biological (microbial biomass carbon, soil respiration rate). Beneficial and detrimental results have been obtained in the earliest stages (around three months after organic application) of this long-term restoration experiment. In the first 90 days after wastes application one of the positive effects in the shrub-land soil has been the increase of around 1.7-fold in soil microbial biomass carbon with respect to untreated soils. But, in some treated soils negative effects have been observed too, such as an increase in electrical conductivity. This negative effect is reversible and temporary, and may disappear after rainfalls. Therefore, the application of the different organic wastes to degraded soils could be a good restoration management.},

abstract={Soil properties related to carbon and nitrogen dynamics of a savanna of Elionurus muticus (Spreng) O. Kuntze under three different fire frequencies ('fire history') were compared at one point of time. Soil was described as a Torriorthentic Haplustoll. Fire frequencies were characterized as: high (one fire every year), medium or normal (one fire every 3-4 years), and low (one fire every 10 years). Total soil organic carbon (COT) and nitrogen (NOT) contents, particulate organic matter carbon (COP) and nitrogen (NOP) contents, carbon content of the gross organic matter fraction (COG), as well as soil nitrate nitrogen content (N-NO3), soil respiration and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (NBM) were assessed at two soil depths, 0-2.5 cm and 2.5-7.5 cm. Gross organic matter carbon was lower under the high frequency than under the medium and low frequency areas. Total soil organic carbon, NOT, N-NO3- and NBM were lower under high frequency fires, than under medium and low frequency fires, that did not differ between them. Particulate organic carbon and NOP were also lower under the high frequency, and were more sensitive than COT and NOT to the effects of fire history. There were not differences in soil respiration among fire histories. These results showed that repeated burns reduce soil organic matter as well as soil biological activity and may increase soil susceptibility to erosion processes. However, areas under medium or normal fire frequency maintained organic nitrogen and carbon pools and showed higher nitrogen availability.},

abstract={Studies on dispersive behavior of semiarid soils upon application of water are very important since such soils are often irrigated and followed by dry periods. The outcome of such treatments on the soils affect the soil physical properties adversely leading to wind erosion. The objective was to determine the water-dispersibility of the semi-arid soils and the contribution of their electrolyte and soil organic carbon (SOC) content in their dispersibility. The soils are mainly Cambic Arenosols (FAO) or Typic Xeropsamments (USDA Soil Taxonomy), kaolinitic with few smectite and low in cation exchange capacity. Ten topsoil samples from 0-20 cm depth for this study were collected from the aeolian zones of northern Nigeria. Total clay content of the soils varied between 6 and 16% while water-dispersible clay was low (4-8%) and a reflection of the low total clay content. Organic carbon (OC) correlated significantly with WDC (r = 0.57) while exchangeable Na+ also correlated significantly with total clay (DC) and WDC (r = 0.84,0.67) respectively Organic carbon, and exchangeable Na+, influenced water-dispersible clay content while exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR) and electrolytic conductivity (EC) correlated significantly with clay-dispersion ratio (CDR).

abstract={Soil carbon is a major determinant of sustainability of agricultural systems and changes can occur in both total and active or labile C pools. The measurements of soil organic matter (SOM) changes under various forms of land use are needed for the development of sustainable systems. Soil organic matter quality was assessed by HA:FA ratios determined by two fractional methods (Tyurin's in modification Ponomareva-Plotnikova and by Kononova-Belchikova method) and by the calculation of Carbon Pool Index (CPI) and Lability Index (LI), these were used to calculate a Carbon Management Index (CMI). These parameters were determined and assessed in arable soil (two sites - on upland and colluvial foot slope) and in forest soil (National Nature Reserve) in locality Báb. Analyses of paired samples (cropped and uncropped soil) have shown high difference in total and labile carbon content, and in quality of SOM caused by intensive cultivation. We observed a decline in CPI as influence of erosion processes and cultivation, a greater decline in LI and hence a decline in CMI. Labile carbon and the CMI can be used effectively to monitor the rate of change in soil carbon.},

abstract={Some general notions on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and the difficulties to evaluate this process globally are presented. Problems of time- and space- scales are emphasized. SOC erosion, which is generally difficult to evaluate in relation to land use changes, is discussed in detail. Different aspects of SOC sequestration on the Lesser Antilles are presented for a wide range of soil types. Comparisons between soils revealed that the SOC stocks in the Lesser Antilles are highly dependent upon the mineralogy: higher stocks for allophanic (ALL) soils than for low activity clay (LAC) and high activity clay (HAC) soils. But in terms of potential of SOC sequestration (pSeq-SOC, differences between permanent vegetation and continuous cultivation situations), there are no differences between ALL and LAC soils (22.9 and 23.3 tC. ha-1 respectively). On the other hand, the potentials of SOC sequestration were higher for HAC soils (30.8 - 59.4 tC. ha-1, with the higher levels in the less Mg- and Na-affected Vertisol). Sheet erosion is a serious problem for Vertisol with high Mg and Na on exchange complex, causing high dispersability of fine elements. Thus, the lower SOC levels in these soils may be partly due to erosion losses. Laboratory incubations have shown that 37 - 53% of the protected SOC in these soils was located in aggregates larger than 0.2 mm. The effect of agricultural practices on SOC sequestration was studied for the Vertisols. Intensification of pastures led to higher plant productivity and higher organic matter restitutions and SOC sequestration. The gain was 53.5 and 25.4 tC. ha-1 for the low and high-Mg Vertisol, respectively (0-20 cm layer). SOC sequestration with pastures also depends upon the plot history with lower mean annual increase in SOC for the initially eroded (1.0 gC. kg-1 soil. yr-1) than for the non-degraded (1.5 gC. kg-1 soil. yr-1) Vertisol. Loss of SOC in a pasture-market gardening rotation was 22.2 tC. ha-1 with deep (30-40 cm) and 10.7 tC. ha-1 with surface (10-15 cm) tillage. It was unclear whether the differences in SOC losses were due to mineralization and/or to erosion.},

abstract={The goal of this paper is to put the issue of preserving Soil Organic Matter (SOM) into a regional, urban-rural, context. In doing so, we apply the method of material flux analysis to a watershed in Boyacá in Colombia. We estimate the order of magnitude of the dry organic matter and carbon fluxes between the rural and urban parts of the region, including estimates on biomass growth, tillage, organic waste, and sewage. These estimates are used to derive potentials for carbon cycling between rural and urban areas. It is shown that (i) for the municipality of Tunja, the treated organic wastes produced in the urban area could add about 30% to the current carbon input into arable soils; (ii) to preserve the organic carbon content in soils in Tunja over the long-term, either, erosion control measures have to be implemented and/or the total treated urban organic wastes have to be concentrated on about 1/5 of the agricultural area. However, such an attempt has to consider the possible trade off between allocation needs (poor farmers on the hillside) and allocation costs (transportation and distribution costs).},

abstract={Judged by their negative nutrient balances, low soil cover and low productivity, the predominant agro-pastoral farming systems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa are highly unsustainable for crop production intensification. With kaolinite as the main clay type, the cation exchange capacity of the soils in this region, often less than 1 cmolc kg-1 soil, depends heavily on the organic carbon (Corg) content. However, due to low carbon sequestration and to the microbe, termite and temperature-induced rapid turnover rates of organic material in the present land-use systems, Corg contents of the topsoil are very low, ranging between 1 and 8 g kg-1 in most soils. For sustainable food production, the availability of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) has to be increased considerably in combination with an improvement in soil physical properties. Therefore, the adoption of innovative management options that help to stop or even reverse the decline in Corg typically observed after cultivating bush or rangeland is of utmost importance. To maintain food production for a rapidly growing population, targeted applications of mineral fertilisers and the effective recycling of organic amendments as crop residues and manure are essential. Any increase in soil cover has large effects in reducing topsoil erosion by wind and water and favours the accumulation of wind-blown dust high in bases which in turn improves P availability. In the future decision support systems, based on GIS, modelling and simulation should be used to combine (i) available fertiliser response data from on-station and on-farm research, (ii) results on soil productivity restoration with the application of mineral and organic amendments and (iii) our present understanding of the cause-effect relationships governing the prevailing soil degradation processes. This will help to predict the effectiveness of regionally differentiated soil fertility management approaches to maintain or even increase soil Corg levels.},

abstract={The global population of 6 billion is increasing at the rate of 1.3%or 73 million persons/year.A the present rate of growth,the population will reach 7.5 billion by 2020 and 9.4 billion by 2050.With the projected increase in world population and change in food habits,the future food demand for cereals will increase drastically. Therefore,among principal global concerns of the twenty-.rst century are: (1)food security due to a rapid increase in the world population,(2)soil degradation by land misuse and soil mismanagement;and (3)anthropogenic increases in atmo spheric greenhouse gases.All of these issues are linked to the sustainability of soil quality especially in relation to the soil organic carbon (SOC)pool and its dynamics. Soil supports terrestrial life through .ve processes:(1)biomass productivity,(2)restoration and resilience of ecosystems,(3)puri .cation of water,(4)detoxication of pollutants,and (5)cycling of C,N,P,S,and H2O.These processes are affected by the quality and quantity of the SOC pool.However,the SOC pool of agricultural soils has been depleted by 30-40 Mg C/ha (Mg =1 metric ton, 1hectare =2 47 acres)due to cultivation and other degradative processes,which has set in motion the downward spiral of soil degradation. The increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 is occurring at the rate of 3.4 billion metric tons (Pg)/year.In addition to fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacture,this increase is caused by deforestation,biomass burning,and soil cultivation.Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems has resulted in emission of 66-90 Pg of C from world soils.The rate and magnitude of gaseous emissions from world soils are exacerbated by soil degradative processes,that is,decline in soil structure,accelerated erosion,and nutrient imbalance.Until the 1970s,more C was emitted annually from soils and land-use conversion than from fossil fuel combustion.Currently,about 25%of global emissions are from all agricultural activites.Judicious land use and recommended soil management techniques can resequester 60-70% of the historic C loss. Adoption of recommended agricultural practices or agricultural intensication can improve productivity and resequester C lost from the world soils.In the past 50 years,the number of people fed by a single U.S.farmer has increased from 19 o 129 through adoption of recommended agricultural practices.Such practices include use of conservation tillage,growing cover crops,using biosolids and amendments,enhancing soil fertility through judicious use of fertilizers and adopting precision farming,water conservation and improved methods of irrigation,and use of improved varieties.The global potential of soil C se-questration is estimated at 0.9-1.9 Pg/year through deserti .cation control and about 3 Pg/year through restoration of all degraded soils.Soil carbon sequestration is a win -win strategy based on adoption of improved agricultural practices with potential of 40-70 Pg over a 50-year period.This potential is over and above that in rangeland/pasture soils,forest ecosystem,and biofuel production.In addition,it is important that degraded soils and ecosystems be restored.The soil carbon strategy (1)increases agricultural productivity,(2)improves water and air quality,and (3)reduces the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2. As the world population continues to grow,available farmland shrinks and the emission of gases into the atmosphere increases.Nonetheless,world soils have the capacity to feed the current and future population provided that soils are used,improved,and restored.As has been the case in the past,those holding neo-Malthusian views will again be proven wrong through adoption of recommended agricultural practices for sustainable management of soil resources. Contrary to the misconception,adoption of recommended agricultural practices is a solution to the environmental issues and also to achieving global food security. © 2001.},

abstract={In the Caldenal region, overgrazing causes important soil losses due to water erosion. The magnitude of this process is related to soil properties and vegetation cover. The objective of this study was to evaluate nutrient losses due to water erosion on an Entic Haplustoll and a Typic Ustipsamment. Treatments were: natural vegetation, clipped vegetation with residue reduction, and bare soil. Evaluations were carried out in March and September using a rainfall simulator (28 mm in 30 min) over 2 m 2 runoff plots. Organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N) and available phosphorus (P) were determined on sediments. Average sediment OC and N content was higher in the Haplustoll (59.5 g.kg -1 and 4.3 g.kg -1) than in the Ustipsamment (37.6 g.kg -1 and 2.2 g.kg -1). P was lower in the Haplustoll (29.8 mg.kg -1) than in the Ustipsamment (40.2 mg.kg -1). Losses of N and P were significantly higher in March than in September. In the bare soil, nutrient losses were higher in the Haplustoll than in the Ustipsamment, while with vegetation cover, erosion was of lesser importance, and similar for both soil types. Organic carbon was the soil constituent that suffered the highest losses due to water erosion.},

abstract={In order to establish relative chronological differences among the different geomorphological units, the pedological characteristics of 15 profiles of soils originated on glacial, fluvioglacial and aluvio torrential deposits of different ages, were analyzed in the Venezuelan Central Andes. In addition, some pedogenetic characteristics such as granulometry, texture and morphometry of the sediments were determined, as well as some chemical properties such as pH, pH of abrasion, CIC, percentange of saturation of bases of aluminum and organic carbon. In the same way, the mineralogy of the clay fraction was determined through X-rays analysis. The results of physical and chemical analyses showed no significant differences among the different soil units. At the same time, the mineralogical analysis of the clay fraction revealed the presence of illite, kaolinite and chlorite as principal components. Therefore, it seems that these clays represent a stage of early or incipient weathering, whose origin is intimately related to the parental material of these soils. In this particular case, the pedological analyses were not useful to elaborate a relative chronology by means of which the geomorphological units in deposits of different ages could be separated as a function of the evaluated soil properties.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to compare and determine changes in some soil properties after 27 years. For comparison were used data published by Hrasko (1970), within the frame of MAB - UNESCO Programme. Experimental plot was located in Báb forest declared in 1966 as a National Nature Reserve. We found out, that during 27 years content of soil organic carbon was a little changed, increased in top layer and decreased in depth 0.5-0.6 m, more intensively this changes were in colluvial foot slope than upland site. In topsoil of upland forest position the values of soil reaction slightly increased, more expressive differences were observed in Bt - luvic horizon. In the site on the colluvial foot slope the values of soil reaction slightly decreased in the whole soil profile. Generally, values of soil reaction and content of carbonates in subsoil were similar like those determined in year 1970. On the basis of determined values characterizing compared soil profiles we note, that evidence by Hraško (1970) stated of eolic accumulation on colluvial foot slope site is lesser than in 70'years. This is important result of continuing acidification and erosion processes.},

abstract={At the Csákvár Research Station measurements were carried out on five experimental parcels, four of which represented the uppermost 25 cm (ploughed) layer of the most erosion-relevant soil types from the Balaton Upland and one parcel contained that of the in situ soil. The measured runoff values were fixed by a computer system. The experiments were aimed at the registration of soil loss caused by atmospheric precipitation influencing K (erodibility) factor in the USLE (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). The trends of change in soil parameters during the studied period (1990-2000) are described below based on laboratory analyses of soil samples and on the evaluation of results. The parcels were kept free of vegetation, consequently the organic matter reduced considerably on parcels E, B and C, having already been eroded topsoils when the experiments started. Carbonate content has tended to decrease as well and this loss is probably associated also with soil permeability. The more mobile is water along the profile the higher quantity of carbonates can be solved. For the studied period chemical reaction has hardly changed and despite carbonate loss it remained to be basic. For the past 10 years fundamental changes have occurred in the mechanical composition of soils. Four granulometric classes have been separated as a starting point to create a basis to determine the Wischmeier-Smith nomogrammic K factor based on physical properties of soils. A general trend has been the decrease in clay and sand content and an enrichment in silt fraction. After intense rainfall events a thin, non-structured muddy crust keeps rainwater on the surface as a result of poor permeability. During less intense precipitation events silt fraction is mobilised first and penetrates into the lower horizons transported by the infiltrating water raising the portion of this fraction in the mechanical composition. The typical topsoil granulometry has changed: sand and clay have a relative prevalence, subsequently removed by surface runoff. The experiment suggests that for the application of USLE or the nomogram in Hungary a correction factor has to be built in which should reflect values to be obtained through extensive domestic rainfall simulation.},

abstract={The tropics cover 8.2 billion hectares or approximately 40% of the world's land area. These regions are characterized by a large portion of the world's rapidly increasing population, high risks of soil and environmental degradation because of harsh climate and resource-poor farmers, and rapid decomposition of soil organic matter because of continuously high temperatures. Predominant soils of the tropics include Oxisols, Aridisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols. Soil and ecosystem degradation lead to emissions of greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) into the atmosphere. Anthropogenic activities that exacerbate gaseous emissions include deforestation and biomass burning, low- or no-input subsistence agriculture, plowing, drainage of wetlands, and elimination or shortening of restorative fallows. Soils of the tropics contain about 496 Pg of soil organic carbon (SOC) or 32% of the global pool. The historic loss of the SOC pool, due to land-use change and cultivation, may be 17-39 Pg compared with the global loss of 66-90 Pg. If 60-80% of the SOC lost can be resequestered through land-use change and adoption of recommended management practices, the potential of SOC sequestration in the tropics is 12-27 Pg over a 25-to 50-year period. Important strategies of SOC sequestration include reduction in emission of greenhouse gases and sequestration of carbon (C) in biomass and soils. The potential of C sequestration in soils and biomass of the tropics is estimated at 10.0-25.0 Pg by effective erosion control, 5.7-10.8 Pg through restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems, 58-115 Pg through biofuel offset, 2.2-4.1 Pg through adoption of recommended practices on croplands, and 6.0-12.0 Pg through adoption of recommended practices on grazing lands. Of this, the potential of SOC sequestration is only 13.9-26.9 Pg over the 50-year period. Realization of this vast potential is a challenge for researchers, land managers, and policymakers. © 2002.},

abstract={We discuss paleoenvironmental changes at the Dae-Am San high moor, located near the Demilitarized Zone at 38°N. This area has been reported to be the only high moor in the Korean peninsula. The 14C age of the bottom sediment (75-80 cm in depth) at this site is about 1900 BP. Since the radiocarbon ages for the intervals at 50-55 cm and 75-80 cm were almost the same, we conclude that the deep layers (55-80 cm) in the high moor were all part of the original soil. Low organic C and N contents in the deeper layers support this inference. The 50-55-cm layer consists of sandy material with very low organic content, suggesting erosion from the surrounding area. The surface layer (0-5 cm) was measured as 190 BP. and the middle layer (30-35 cm) was 870 BP. The bulk sedimentation rate was estimated to be about 0.4 mm yr-1 for the 0-30-cm interval. The δ13C value of organic carbon in the sediments fluctuated with depth. The δ13C profile of the Dae-Am San high moor may be explained by climatic changes which occurred during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period. © 2001 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.},

abstract={The distribution of particulpate organic carbon (POC) along the lower reaches is similar between the dry season and the flood season in the Yalujiang Estuary, North China. However, the values of particulate organic carbon of the upperstream in the dry season are one magnitude lower than the concentrations in the flood season. Stable carbon isotope ratios have been used to study the sources of particulate organic carbon in the Yalujiang Estuary. The isotopic composition of POC shows a range from -23.1‰ to -29.4‰ with a little seasonal variation. The isotopic evidence indicates that the POC in the Yalujiang Estuary is predominantly of terrestrial origin rather than a result of in situ plankton. The study of the ratio of POC: Chla shows that the turbidity maximum plays an important role in POC cycle in the Yalujiang Estuary. Organic detritus and soil erosion are the main contributions to POC in the turbidity maximum, especially in the flood season.},

abstract={In intensive cropping systems, mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizers represent the largest component of the N cycle because the indigenous N supply is not adequate. The requirement for mineral fertilizer may be reduced with the use of organic nutrient sources. A more realistic use of organic matter, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa due to limited amounts and availability, is the combined use of organic nutrient sources and mineral fertilizers. The beneficial effects of integrated use of inorganic fertilizers and organic manures on improved nutrient recoveries, soil moisture retention, cation exchange capacity, and erosion control have been reported. However, there are as many reports indicating negligible benefits or even disadvantages of combining nutrient sources on crop production. This is not surprising given the combination of organic residue sources, soils, climatic, crops, and management factors that influence nutrient dynamics. The most widely accepted function of organic materials is improving the nutrient availability to crops by supplying N. The key to both improving efficiency of N use and reducing N losses is synchronization of N supply from soil, biological N2 fixation, organic residues, and inorganic fertilizers with the crop N demand. Organic materials are not magic; N losses also result from their use. Controlling N release from organic sources depends on their nutrient content and quality, soil properties, and the environmental and management factors. This paper will synthesize the information generated from integrated nutrient management trials in sub-Saharan Africa and the Philippines. Management strategies based on an organic resources database and a dynamic soil-crop simulation model are used to identify organic sources as N fertilizers or soil amendments. The decision support tools are also used to attain optimum synchrony between release from organic sources and soils with crop N demand.},

abstract={The fate of soil organic matter during erosion and sedimentation has been difficult to assess because of the large size and complex turnover characteristics of the soil carbon reservoir. It has been assumed that most of the carbon released during erosion is lost to oxidation. Budgets of bulk soil and soil organic carbon erosion and deposition suggest that the primary fates of eroded soil carbon across the conterminous United States are trapping in impoundments and other redeposition. The total amount of soil carbon eroded and redeposited across the United States is ∼0.04 Gt yr-1. Applying this revision to the U. S. carbon budget by Houghton et al. [1999] raises their net sequestration estimate by 20-47 %. If comparable rates of erosion and redeposition occur globally, net carbon sequestration would be ∼1 Gt yr-1.},

abstract={A better understanding of tillage effects on soil organic matter is vital for development of effective soil conservation practices. The objective of this research is to determine the effect of tillage and crop sequence on soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) content in an irrigated southern Alberta soil. A field experiment was conducted using a split-split plot design from 1994 to 1998 in Alberta, Canada. There were two crop sequences (Sequence 1: spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.)-spring wheat-annual legume; and Sequence 2: spring wheat-spring wheat-annual legume-sugar beet) and two tillage practices (CT: conventional tillage and MT: minimum tillage). Surface soil under MT had significantly higher OC (30.1 Mg ha-1) content than under CT (28.3 Mg ha-1) after 4 years of treatment. The MT treatment retains crop residue at the soil surface, reduces soil erosion and slows organic matter decomposition, which are key factors in enhancing the soil fertility status of southern Alberta irrigated soils. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Data are presented on the effects of modern farming practices on soil as an agricultural resource in England and Wales (E&W), namely: nutrient status, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), heavy metal concentrations, and on soil erosion risk. Fertilizer-N inputs to tillage (arable) and grassland soils increased from 84 and 65 kg/ha N in 1969 to 151 and 120 kg/ha N, respectively, in 1997. The estimated N surplus (inputs less outputs) increased from 84 and 96 kg/ha N to 102 and 154 kg/ha N, respectively, over the same time. Phosphorus inputs to tillage (mean 37 kg/ha P) and grassland (mean 21 kg/ha P) changed little over the period. However, P surpluses decreased from 25 kg/ha P in 1969 to 15 kg/ha P in 1997 on tillage land (largely as a result of greater P offtakes), and from 20 to 17 kg/ha P in 1997 on grassland (largely because of a small decrease in fertilizer P). The cumulative tillage land soil P surplus was c. 580 kg/ha P, and was estimated to increase topsoil total P concentrations by c. 170 mg/kg P and Olsen-extractable soil P by c. 26 mg/l P. The mean annual P surplus for grassland was 18 kg/ha P which, over the study period, added c. 427 kg/ha P to the soil, an increase in topsoil total P of c. 214 mg/kg P, and in Olsen-extractable P of 19 mg/l P. Concentrations of SOC in some soils have decreased between 1980 and 1995, especially where soils have been ploughed out of grassland and on lowland organic and peaty soils in tillage. The mean SOC of soils in arable/ley cultivation in 1980 was 3.4% and 2.8% in 1995. The proportion of arable soils with pH < 6.0 decreased from 10% in 1969-73 to 4% in 1990-93, reflecting the better targeting of lime inputs. In contrast, the proportion of grassland soils with pH < 6.0 increased from 39% in 1969-73 to 56% in 1990-93. Although there were statistically significant changes in the mean soil concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn between 1980 and 1995, many of the changes were small in absolute terms. Hence, there was little evidence of marked or systematic changes in topsoil total heavy metal concentrations that could not be explained by factors other than increased pollutant loadings. Over the next 50 years or so, the threat from soil erosion to crop productivity will be greatest on shallow soils (≤ c. 0.3 m depth), mostly over chalk and sandstone as further removal of soil will lead to increased drought stress. Provided that nutrient supplies are maintained, the evidence is that losses in arable crops on eroded soils would range between 2 % and 8 % of current yields. Thus, within the limitations of the data available, both in time and space, we found little evidence that most soils in E&W cannot continue to support modern farming practices, and the associated crop and animal outputs, given appropriate inputs of nutrients and an adequate degree of crop protection.},

abstract={Increase in the use of conservation practices by agriculture in the United States will enhance soil organic carbon and potentially increase carbon sequestration. This, in turn, will decrease the net emission of carbon dioxide. A number of studies exist that calibrate the contribution of various individual, site-specific conservation practices on changes in soil organic carbon. There is a general absence, however, of a comprehensive effort to measure objectively the contribution of these practices including conservation tillage, the Conservation Reserve Program, and conservation buffer strips to an change in soil organic carbon. This paper fills that void. After recounting the evolution of the use of the various conservation practices, it is estimated that organic carbon in the soil in 1998 in the United States attributable to these practices was about 12.2 million metric tons. By 2008, there will be an increase of about 25%. Given that there is a significant potential for conservation practices to lead to an increase in carbon sequestration, there are a number of policy options that can be pursued.},

abstract={There are a number of uncertainties in the use of 137Cs as a marker for deriving soil erosion rates. However, this should not limit other potential uses of this anthropogenic radionuclide in the study of soil landscape processes. This study outlines a sampling methodology which aids in the assessment of the history of erosion and depositional processes within a landscape unit. The depth distribution of 137Cs and soil organic carbon (SOC) was utilized as a means of determining the erosion and depositional history of a conventionally tilled agricultural field in southern Ontario, Canada. Three transects oriented along the slope of a large field had five soil profiles excavated at the summit, sideslope, shoulder slope, footslope and toeslope landscape positions. The soils were sampled in 5 cm increments, and 137Cs and SOC were determined on the samples. The results show that soil redistribution within landscape units of agricultural fields has been substantial both before and after fallout of 137Cs to the soil surface. Soils in depositional areas contained significant 137Cs and SOC at depths beyond which the plow can attain at present. This implies that a significant amount of carbon is being sequestered beneath the present plow layer, and the characterization of this pool must be considered in deriving the dynamics of SOC in agroecosystems. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The Santa Clara River is a prototypical small mountainous river, with a headwater height greater than 1000 m and a basin area smaller than 10,000 m2. Although individual small mountainous rivers export trivial amounts of sediment and carbon to the ocean, as a group these rivers may export a major fraction (as much as 50%) of the total global river sediment flux [Milliman and Syvitski, 1992], making their geochemistry relevant the study of the ocean's carbon cycle. In addition, many small rivers export sediment in a few high flux events, causing massive, sporadic discharge of carbon onto coastal shelves, discharge conditions very different from those of large rivers. This class of rivers is an end-member of the river-ocean carbon exchange system, opposite the Earth's largest river, the Amazon. The carbon mass and isotopic properties of the Santa Clara River are significantly different from previously studied large rivers. During the 1997-1998 winter, all Santa Clara carbon pools were old, with flux-weighted average Δ14C values of -428 ± 76‰ for particulate organic carbon, -73 ± 31‰ for dissolved organic carbon, and -644 ± 58‰ for black carbon. The age of exported carbon is primarily due to the deep erosion of old soils and not to inclusion of fossil fuel carbon. Additionally, the δ13C signatures of exported carbon pools were high relative to terrestrial carbon, bearing a signature quite similar to marine carbon (average particulate organic carbon (POC) δ13C= -22.2 ± 0.8‰). The Santa Clara's estuary is small and drains onto the narrow eastern Pacific coastal margin, exporting this old soil organic matter directly into the ocean. If the Santa Clara export patterns are representative of this class of rivers, they may be a significant source of refractory terrestrial carbon to the ocean.},

abstract={Geomorphic erosion on hillslopes creates a distribution of soil properties within the landscape that influences ecosystem, erosional, and hydrological processes. These soil properties typically reflect topography and define a template for plant productivity and consequent soil carbon accumulation. Erosion also redistributes soil carbon and, by burying or excavating carbon, changes turnover time and may figure prominently in the global carbon budget [Stallard, 1998]. In this paper, we present the Changing Relief and Evolving Ecosystems Project (CREEP), a theoretical, process-response model that focuses on the redistribution of soil texture and soil carbon along a hillslope in response to geomorphic transport processes. The CREEP model simulates long-term ecological and geomorphic landscape evolution by simulating general soil, vegetation, and hillslope transport relationships. In particular, the model allows for the removal and downslope transport of soil carbon, as well as for the burial and decomposition of carbon in the accumulation zone. CREEP model results suggest that sandy soils are more likely to differentiate downslope with respect to soil texture than are more clay-rich soils and that this redistribution will lead to disproportionately broad areas of predominantly coarse-grained particles on upper slopes. Gridded biogeochemical models, which may otherwise overlook landscape heterogeneity, may use CREEP estimates of the areal distribution of soil texture as a basis for parametrically capturing trace gas fluxes nonlinearly related to soil texture.},

abstract={Sediment and total phosphorus (TP) export vary through space and time. This study was conducted to determine the factors controlling sediment and TP export in two agricultural catchments situated in the Belgian Loess Belt. At the outlet of these catchments runoff discharge was continuously measured and suspended sediment samples were taken during rainfall events. Within the catchments vegetation type and cover, soil surface parameters, erosion features, sediment pathways, and rainfall characteristics were monitored. Total P content and sediment characteristics such as clay, organic carbon, and suspended sediment concentration were correlated. Total sediment and TP export differ significantly between the monitored catchments. Much of the difference is due to the occurrence of an extreme event in one catchment and the morphology and spatial organization of land use in the catchments. In one catchment, the direct connection between erosive areas and the catchment outlet by means of a road system contributed to a high sediment delivery ratio (SDR) at the outlet. In the other catchment, the presence of a wide valley in the center of the catchment caused sediment deposition. Vegetation also had an effect on sediment production and deposition. Thus, many factors control sediment and TP export from small agricultural catchments; some of these factors are related to the physical catchment characteristics such as morphology and landscape structure and are (semi)permanent, while others, such as vegetation cover and land use, are time dependent.},

abstract={Eroded soil material may be an important transporting agent for pesticides that are strongly sorbed to soil. The ability of the fungicide propiconazole to interact with colloidal and particulate materials has been studied by means of sorption and desorption experiments. Size separation of silty clay soil from Mørdre, Norway and subsequent characterization showed that different size fractions of soil possessed different physical and chemical properties and, therefore, different capacity to associate with propiconazole. A large part of the soil organic carbon was associated with coarser material (2-0.02 mm), which also showed higher affinity towards propiconazole than for smaller size fractions (&lt;20 and &lt;2 μm). Similar Koc values (2306 and 2244) for the size fractions &lt;2 and &lt;20 μm indicate that organic carbon played a dominant role in the sorption of propiconazole. Furthermore, organic carbon associated with these size fractions seemed to have similar properties with respect to binding of propiconazole. Although, poor in organic carbon (0.4%), the smallest size fraction (&lt;2 μm) had higher sorption capacity for propiconazole compared to the medium size fraction (&lt;20 μm). Higher sorption for the smallest size fraction (&lt;2 μm) is probably due to higher specific surface area, cation exchange capacity and content of Fe/A1 oxides (free, organically bound and amorphous oxides) than the other size fractions. Results from the desorption experiments indicate that a part of propiconazole associates with sites in the soil material that resist desorption. Fluvial sediments originating from propiconazole treated fields may, therefore, represent potential reservoirs of propiconazole. Treatment with H2O2 modified the sorption/desorption characteristics of the soil beyond that which could be expected simply by the removal of organic material. The pH values for all the size fractions decreased, and the specific surface area of the medium sized fraction (&lt;20 μm) increased from 14 to 19 m2 g-1 after the treatment with H2O2, probably due to disruption of the aggregate structure. Carrying out fractionation and separation procedures, it is important to be aware of physical and chemical changes that are introduced during the different steps. An effort should be made to develop fractionation methods that keep the original characteristics of the soil material as intact as possible.},

abstract={The burgeoning poultry industry in the southeastern US is presenting a major environmental problem of safe disposal of poultry litter (PL). In a comprehensive study, we explored ways of PL use in conservation tillage-based cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production systems on a Decatur silt loam soil in north Alabama, from 1996 to 1999. The study reported here-in presents the residual effects of PL applied to cotton in mulch-till (MT) and no-till (NT) conservation tillage systems in 1997 and 1998 cropping seasons on N uptake, growth, and yield of rye (Secale cereale, L.) cover crop and rotational corn (Zea mays L.) in 1999. Rye was grown without additional N, whereas corn was grown at three inorganic N levels (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha-1). Poultry litter was applied to cotton in 1997 and 1998 at 0, 100, and 200 kg N ha-1. Residual N from PL applied to cotton in 1997 and 1998 produced up to 2.0 and 17.3 Mg ha-1, respectively, of rye cover crop and corn biomass (includes 7.1 Mg ha-1 of corn grain yield) without additional fertilizer. Therefore, in addition to supplying crop residues which reduce soil erosion, increase soil organic matter, and conserve soil moisture, the rye cover crop was able to scavenge residual N left by the cotton crop, which would otherwise, be at risk of being leached and pollute groundwater resources. Poultry litter applied to cotton also increased corn grain quality as shown by up to 100% increase in grain N content compared to the 0N treatment. Using PL with a slower rate of N release compared to inorganic fertilizer to meet some of the N requirements of corn, will not only reduce N fertilizer costs for corn, but will also reduce the risk of nitrate N leaching into groundwater. The maximum amount of crop residues added to the cotton based cropping system by residual N from PL and inorganic N was 21.3 Mg ha-1. This will lead to an increase in soil organic carbon and soil structure in the long term and a reduction in soil erosion, thereby further improving soil productivity, while at the same time, protecting the environment from nitrate pollution and soil degradation. Our study demonstrates that cotton under conservation tillage system in combination with rye cover crop and rotational corn cropping could use large quantities of PL thereby avoiding serious potential environmental hazards. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The accelerated greenhouse effect and the degradation of land resources by water and wind erosion are two major, yet interrelated global environmental challenges. Accelerated decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) in cultivated soils results in decline in SOC stocks over time and also contributes to increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Off-site transport of SOC in runoff waters during erosional events also contributes to SOC depletion, but there is a paucity of data in the literature documenting erosional SOC losses and the fate of eroded SOC. In this paper, we present a mass balance approach to compute CO2 evolved from mineralization of SOC during transport and deposition of eroded soils. Erosion-induced CO2 emission rates ranging between 6 and 52 g C m-2 yr-1 were computed using data on SOC stocks and dynamics from a series of long-term experiments conducted across a range of ecological regions. For the cropland of the world, we estimated an annual flux of 0.37 Pg CO2-C to the atmosphere due to water erosion. This flux is significant and suggests that water erosion must be taken into consideration when constructing global and regional C budgets. Through its contribution to atmospheric CO2 increase, water erosion can have a positive feedback on the accelerated greenhouse effect. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Soil erosion contributes to the removal of soil organic carbon (SOC) from cultivated soils and its entrapment in terrestrial depressions. The fate of SOC entrapped in terrestrial deposits is largely unknown, but there has been speculation that such entrapment could lead to C sequestration, thereby playing a role in global C cycling. It has been hypothesized that the fate of eroded C in these deposits depends on SOC quality (bioavailability) and the environmental conditions at the depositional site. The SOC storage and dynamics were studied in cultivated, forested, and deposited soils at sites with and without subsurface tile-drainage. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), readily mineralizable C (MinC), and basal soil respiration (BSR) rates were used as SOC quality indicators and were assessed in field-moist soil aggregates of four sizes: 2-3 mm, 1-2 mm, 0.5-1 mm and &lt;0.5 mm. Soil organic carbon inventory (mass of C over the depth sampled) was significantly different (P &lt; 0.01) among the land uses and was in the order: deposit &gt; forest &gt; cropland. It was also significantly (P &lt; 0.1) different between the two deposits, amounting to 14.6 and 17.1 kg C m-2 in the tile-drained and undrained deposits, respectively. Over that same depth, the total SOC pool in the forest soil was 9.5 kg C m-2. Overall, the various aggregate sizes did not differ significantly in terms of their total SOC content, but the SOC quality indicators (MBC, MinC, and BSR) were generally higher in the larger than in the smaller aggregates. These indices were also higher in the forest and depression sites than in the croplands. The data indicated that cultivation and erosion resulted in depletion of both total and labile SOC, but the labile pools were depleted at rates 1.5 to 3 times faster. Conversely, there was an enrichment in both clay (1.4 to 2 times) and SOC (1.3 to 1.6 times) in the depression areas, indicating removal of fine particle-associated SOC from the cultivated fields and its entrapment in the deposits. However, the levels of labile C (MBC, MinC) in the entrapped materials were 20 to 46% lower than would be anticipated based on their total C contents. These reductions suggest that, compared with the forest and cropland, a relatively greater proportion of the C retained in the deposits is in the slow and passive pools, and that distribution is favorable to sequestration of C in these landscape positions.},

abstract={The watersheds at Bear Creek, Oak Ridge, TN, have similar soil - landscape relationships. The lower reaches of many of these watersheds consist of headwater riparian wetlands situated between sloping non-wetland upland zones. The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of (i) slope and geomorphic processes, (ii) human impacts, and (iii) particular characteristics of soils and saprolite that may effect drainage and water movement in the wetlands and adjacent landscapes in one of these watersheds. A transect was run from west to east in a hydrological monitored area at the lower reaches of a watershed on Bear Creek. This transect extended from a steep side slope position across a floodplain, a terrace, and a shoulder slope. On the upland positions of the Nolichucky Shale, mass wasting, overland flow and soil creep currently inhibit soil formation on the steep side slope position where a Typic Dystrudept is present, while soil stability on the shoulder slope has resulted in the formation of a well-developed Typic Hapludult. In these soils, argillic horizons occur above C horizons on less sloping gradients in comparison to steeper slopes, which have Bw horizons over Cr (saprolite) material. A riparian wetland area occupies the floodplain section, where a Typic Endoaquept is characterized by poorly drained conditions that led to the development of redoximorphic features (mottling), gleying, organic matter accumulation, and minimal development of subsurface horizons. A thin colluvial deposit overlies a thick well developed Aquic Hapludalf that formed in alluvial sediments on the terrace position. The colluvial deposit from the adjacent shoulder slope is thought to result from soil creep and anthropogenic erosion caused by past cultivation practices. Runoff from the adjacent sloping landscape and groundwater from the adjacent wetland area perhaps contribute to the somewhat poorly drained conditions of this profile. Perched watertables occur in upland positions due to dense saprolite and clay plugging in the shallow zones of the saprolite. However, no redoximorphic features are observed in the soil on the side slope due to high runoff. Remnants of the underlying shale saprolite, which occur as small discolored zones resembling mottles, are also present. The soils in the study have a CEC of &lt; 10 cmol kg-1, silt loam textures and Fed values of 0.5-4.3%. These soils are also mainly acidic and low in total carbon. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Ridge tillage is a special conservation tillage method, but the long-term effect of this tillage system on crop yield and soil quality in a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation is largely unknown in the northern Corn Belt of the USA. Our objectives were to compare crop performance and soil condition at three nitrogen-fertilizer levels under ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). The experiment was started in 1990 at Brookings, SD, on a Barnes clay loam (US soil taxonomy: fine-loamy, mixed Udic Haploboroll; FAO classification: Chernozem). CT included moldboard or chisel plowing, seedbed preparation with tandem disk and field cultivator, and row cultivation. Raised beds under RT were maintained using only row cultivation. Corn grain yield was significantly (p ≤ 0.10) greater on CT than on RT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) corn yield was 6267 kg ha-1 with RT and 6500 kg ha-1 with CT. Soybean grain yield was not significantly (p ≤ 0.10) different between RT and CT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) soybean yield was 1997 kg ha-1 with RT and 2058 kg ha-1 with CT. In 9 of 11 years there was a significant soybean-yield response to N-starter fertilizer. There was no significant accumulation of NO3-N in the top 3 m of soil at the end of 9 years in either tillage treatment (111 kg NO3-N ha-1 under RT and 121 kg NO3-N ha-1 under CT). Soil pH in the top 15 cm was unaffected by tillage (average pH was 6.62). In 1999, soil organic C in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under CT (56 Mg ha-1) than under RT (52 Mg ha-1). Bulk density in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under RT (1.52 g cm-3) than under CT (1.44 g cm-3). Tillage did not have a great effect on grain yield or soil properties. RT can protect soil from erosion because crop residues remain relatively undisturbed on the soil surface in contrast to chisel plow. In this respect, we expect RT to be more sustainable over the long term than chisel plow tillage. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={This study evaluated seasonal variability in the quantity and quality of particulate organic matter exported by the Columbia River into its estuary. Samples of suspended particulate material (SPM), collected monthly over a 1 year period (November 1995-October 1996) from a freshwater site in the Columbia River, near the head of its estuary, were analyzed for total aluminum, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PN, respectively) and algal pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids). High Al content, averaging 7.9% by weight throughout the year, indicated that detrital minerals accounted for the majority of SPM mass at all times. Organic matter (approximately 2 X POC) varied on a seasonal basis both in terms of its mass contribution to SPM (5-26% by weight) and its chemical composition. In winter, organic matter originated mainly from allochthonous sources, most likely from erosion of soils. Diatoms, the major phytoplankton group present as inferred from pigment analysis, "bloomed" in April-June 1996, resulting in increased autochthonous contribution to POC during spring and summer as well as increased organic matter content of SPM introduced to the estuary. Comparison with results for the same site in the mainstem Columbia obtained between 1990 and 1999 as part of a land-margin ecosystem research project shows that enhanced algal production in springtime is not a feature unique to our data set, at least in the Columbia River's present highly regulated state of hydrographic operation. The possibility is discussed that recent human influence, principally dam construction, has significantly altered the historical SPM concentration and the chemical composition of its associated organic matter.

abstract={Studies on dispersive behavior of semiarid soils upon application of water are very important since such soils are often irrigated and followed by dry periods. The outcome of such treatments on the soils affect the soil physical properties adversely leading to wind erosion. The objective was to determine the water-dispersibility of the semi-arid soils and the contribution of their electrolyte and soil organic carbon (SOC) content in their dispersibility. The soils are mainly Cambic Arenosols (FAO) or Typic Xeropsamments (USDA Soil Taxonomy), kaolinitic with few smectite and low in cation exchange capacity. Ten topsoil samples from 0-20 cm depth for this study were collected from the aeolian zones of northern Nigeria. Total clay content of the soils varied between 6 and 16% while water-dispersible clay was low (4-8%) and a reflection of the low total clay content. Organic carbon (OC) correlated significantly with WDC (r = 0.57) while exchangeable Na+ also correlated significantly with total clay (DC) and WDC (r = 0.84, 0.67) respectively Organic carbon, and exchangeable Na+, influenced water-dispersible clay content while exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR) and electrolytic conductivity (EC) correlated significantly with clay-dispersion ratio (CDR).},

abstract={Cable-logging is a method commonly used to harvest native forests on steep slopes in Tasmania, Australia. A study was carried out to determine impacts on site disturbance and selected soil properties resulting from cable-logging wet eucalypt forest developed on granite substrates in northeastern Tasmania. The results show that both the area and depth of soil surface disturbance are relatively minor, with ca. 11% of the study coupe affected by moderate (litter and part topsoil removed) or severe (subsoil exposed) disturbance. Cable draglines accounted for just over 7% of the soil disturbance (7% moderate and 0.2% severe), whereas tree uprooting associated with the logging accounted for a further 3% moderate disturbance and 1% severe disturbance. Measurements of soil properties in the surface layer (0-10 cm) show that bulk density is ca. 20% higher and organic carbon content (kg/ha) is 15% lower on cable draglines compared to undisturbed sites. However, the dominant type of soil disturbance caused by cable-logging appears to have been displacement of the upper 10 cm of topsoil from the centre to the outside edges of draglines rather than compaction in situ. Comparison of the data with studies of ground-based logging of wet native forests elsewhere in southeastern Australia shows that cable-logging has resulted in significantly less impact on both area of soil disturbed and soil properties. The results are also discussed in relation to relevant sustainability indicators (soil erosion, organic matter and compaction) specified in Criterion 4 of the Montreal Process together with recently proposed threshold values. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The odor emissions from the three types of biosolids from King County, WA, were measured using dilution-to-threshold olfactometry and mass spectral analyses. This article describes thermal desorption and cryogenic GC/MS methods developed to characterize odorant emissions from biosolids application to forest soil. The major odorous compounds volatilized from two anaerobically digested biosolids were ammonia and dimethyl disulfide, with lesser quantities of carbon disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, trimethyl amine, acetone and methyl ethyl ketone. A third type of biosolids was formed by centrifuge and drying one of the other biosolids at 190 °C. This dry biosolids produced more odor and volatilized a more complex array of volatile compounds including: dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, methylethyl disulfide, methane thiol, trimethyl amine, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. Odor unit emissions were not found to correlate with microbial activity, initial biosolids ammonium, organic nitrogen, and total sulfur. Variability in odor emission were explained by the number of odorous compounds volatilized from each material, surface area of biosolids and drying of the biosolids.},

abstract={A knowledge of the kinetics of organic matter transformations in arable soils is important for managing them sustainably. Our aim in this study was to elucidate the effects of cropping period on pools of C and N in coarse-textured savanna soils of the South African Highveld. Composite samples were taken from the top 20 cm of soils (Plinthustalfs) that have been cropped for lengths of time varying from 0 to 98 years in each of three different agro-ecosystems in the Free State Province of South Africa. Thereafter, soil organic C and N concentrations were determined in the bulk soil (< 2 mm) as well as in the clay (<2 μm), silt (2-20 μm), fine sand (20-250 μm), and coarse sand (250-2000 μm) separates. Long-term cultivation of native grassland reduced soil C and N concentrations by 65 and 55%, respectively. Losses of soil organic matter occurred from all particle-size separates, although rate loss constants increased as particle size increased. The concentrations of organic C reached equilibrium after 34 years for the bulk soil and after 55 years for clay-size separates. Nevertheless, organic matter attached to silt continued to be lost as the cropping continued, probably due to wind erosion. Changes in soil properties thereby continued even after almost 100 years of cultivation.},

abstract={Four representative profiles of poorly developed soils on consolidated material were studied in the Sierra de Carrascoy (SE Spain). The soils, with A-A/R or A-C/R type profiles, have medium-low contents of organic carbon and nitrogen, and calcium carbonate occurs in only one of the profiles. The pH in aqueous suspension is slightly alkaline. The cation exchange capacity is medium-low, but varies slightly between profiles, and the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is low. There are wide textural differences. The clay fractions contain illite, kaolinite, vermiculite, smectites, chlorite, quartz and feldspars. The heavy fraction of the fine sand contains mainly opaque minerals and alterites, with some resistant minerals of metamorphic origin. The profiles are classified by F.A.O-I.S.R.I.C.-I.S.S.S. [World Reference Base for Soil Resources. World Soil Resources Reports 84. F.A.O., Rome, 1998] as Calcaric, Eutric and Hyperskeletic Leptosols. According to Soil Survey Staff [Soil Taxonomy. A basic system of soil classification for making and interpreting soil surveys, 2nd edn., United States Department of Agriculture. Natural Resources Conservation Service. US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1999], they are all Lithic and Typic Xerorthents and Lithic Xeric and Xeric Torriorthents. The principal present-day pedogenetic processes in these soils are humification and clay formation. However, profile 1 has evolved from a fersiallitic soil with clay accumulation, although these features have almost disappeared because of erosion and modern humification, pedoturbation and recalcification. Its relict features consist of the remains of a paleoargic horizon inherited from earlier climatic conditions, which was later truncated and is now preserved only in more stable physiographic positions. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The sedimentary core BDP-93-2, Lake Baikal, southeast Siberia, provides a high-resolution record of the interval corresponding to marine oxygen isotope stage 3 (MIS 3). Sharp drops in fossil diatom abundance suggest the occurrence of short-term cooling episodes in Lake Baikal area during this time interval. AMS radiocarbon dates on core BDP-93-2 constrain the age of the upper three episodes (younger than 24 ka BP, younger than 30.5 ka BP, older than 34 ka BP) and therefore permit correlation of the Baikal diatom abundance record with records of iceberg discharge (Heinrich) events in the North Atlantic. Lithology of BDP-93-2 at the Selenga Delta indicates that cooling episodes are also associated with deposition of distinct layers of brownish mud enriched in terrestrial organic carbon. Thus, two types of signals associated with Heinrich events and Bond cooling cycles are observed in the sedimentary record from Lake Baikal. The lacustrine response to cooling episodes includes basin-wide decreases in diatom production, and the response of the catchment basin includes erosion of soils. These episodes of erosion, herein recognized as "Kuzmin events", are likely related to dramatic changes in atmospheric precipitation regime that impacted the semi-arid provinces of Lake Baikal watershed over the short periods of time represented by these events. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Agricultural management affects soil and soil organic carbon (SOC) erosion. The effect was assessed for a watershed (0.79 ha, 10% slope steepness, 132 m slope length) at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed research station near Coshocton, Ohio, from 1951 to 1998. The agricultural management included: (i) plow-till corn (Zea mays L.)wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-meadow-meadow rotation (CWMM) from 1951 to 1970, (ii) plow-till continuous corn (CC) from 1971 to 1975, (iii) meadow (M) from 1976 to 1983, and (iv) no till corn-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) rotation (CS) from 1984 to 1998. Soil erosion was assessed by sediment collection, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and the 137Cesium (137Cs) method. The SOC erosion was computed as a product of the soil erosion multiplied by the SOC content of 1.51% in the surface soil and by the SOC enrichment ratio of 1.71 except for the proportional equation of the 137Cs method. Sediment collection measurements indicated that the annual soil and SOC erosion rates (Mg ha-1 yr-1) for the corn cycles were, respectively, 1.55 and 0.040 for CWMM, 5.88 and 0.15 for CC, 0.63 and 0.016 for CS, and 2.34 and 0.060 for the entire period. The rates were, respectively, 0.35 and 0.009 for wheat cycles, 0.63 and 0.016 for soybean cycles, and essentially zero for meadow. Furthermore, the rates for the crop rotation periods were, respectively, 0.50 and 0.013 for CWMM, 5.88 and 0.15 for CC, 0.63 and 0.016 for CS, and 1.02 and 0.026 for the entire study period. The estimates by the RUSLE and proportional equation were 3 to 14 and 10 to 55 times the sediment values, respectively. However, the estimates by the revised exponential equation were 1 to 3 times the sediment values.},

abstract={Geochemical analysis of elements and organic matter were conducted on vertical profiles of the recent sediments from Pigeon Lake, Alberta, Canada, to determine historical variations in elemental content of the sediments as related to their geochemical fractions. The elements are grouped according to their affinity with different geochemical fractions, by using cluster analysis and sequential extraction experiments. As a result, four elemental fractions were identified: clastic mineral detritus; carbonate; organic; and elements that show less similarity to the previous groups perhaps due to anthropogenic input or the influence of other fractions, such as oxyhydroxides. Following the identification of geochemical fractions in the sediments, a three-step normalizing method was applied using parameters that represent each geochemical fraction. These normalizing techniques appear to be important in verifying whether the variation of elements is indeed the result of anthropogenic and/or natural activities. The normalized data are correlated with the recent history of human activity and natural events near Pigeon Lake. Given the age of the lake sediments, this correlation indicates that the depth profiles of elements after being normalized to the organic and carbonate fractions reflect the variation of detrital input into the lake. However, the former mainly corresponds to the coarse-grained clastic minerals originating from high-energy erosion as the result of natural events (e.g., flooding), whereas the latter corresponds to the low-energy erosion of the fine particles (enriched in lithophile elements) due to deforestation in the drainage basin. Normalizing to the clastic mineral detritus fraction results in the increase of heavy metals in the uppermost part of the sediment profiles, which coincides with industrial activities during the past two decades in central Alberta. However, the concentration of these elements is negligible, as compared to the quantities released by geogenic processes (erosion).},

abstract={Environmental proxies of soil erosion on Iceland, and oceanographic conditions on the adjacent shelf, were measured on a 50 cm box core taken from the southwest Iceland shelf in 1993 during cruise 93030 of the Canadian ship, CSS Hudson. These data, covering the last several centuries, are compared with the documentary record of sea-ice changes around Iceland since A.D. 1600. The site is under the influence of the Irminger Current, which carries warm, saline, Atlantic water northward along the shelf. Because of the relative warmth of this current, sea ice rarely occurs off southwest Iceland, even during the most severe sea-ice intervals of the historical record. In severe sea-ice years, however, the ice drifts clockwise around Iceland from the northeast and east and, in rare cases, reaches the southern coasts (Ogilvie, 1992). The chronology of the core was established by converting the basal radiocarbon date to calendar years and assuming a linear sedimentation rate from the base of the core to the year of collection, 1993. Organic carbon, stable C and O istotope ratios, planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, and sediment magnetic parameters were measured on samples from the core, plotted against calendar years and compared to the Icelandic sea-ice index. The environmental proxies suggest that increased soil erosion, reduced salinity, and, possibly, decreased marine productivity prevailed during the severe sea-ice interval lasting from the last quarter of the eighteenth century to around 1920. Such a situation could develop with climatic cooling, increased storminess, and loss of vegetation cover to stabilise the soil. Although the core site generally lies outside the sea-ice limits, the evidence clearly shows the influence of sea ice and fresh water, and is sensitive to the overall climatic deterioration manifested by the sea-ice record.},

abstract={Human activities have had pronounced impacts on soil properties. Conifer afforestation in the uplands has caused significant decreases in soil pH and in the quality and turnover of organic matter. Acid deposition has increased soil acidity by a similar amount to conifer afforestation but has been shown to affect soils at greater depths. Acid deposition has also increased the mobility of trace metals in the soil and therefore increased metal concentrations in drainage waters. Applications of sewage sludge to the soil have been shown to increase metal concentrations, although most of the Scottish soils affected have high trace metal binding capacities. Intensification of arable cultivation in the lowlands has reduced organic matter concentrations, structural stability and soil workability, and has had effects on soil erodibility. Human trampling, while highly localised, affects sensitive mountain soils in popular areas, leading to loss of surface organic horizons, and therefore, carbon storage. The future impacts of human activities on the soil may be exacerbated by changing climate, and the need to monitor and predict these will not diminish. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The intensive use for over 100 years of copper sulfate (Bordeaux mixture) to fight against mildew in vineyard soils has led to an important, widespread accumulation of Cu (100 to 1500 mg Cu kg-1 soil). In Champagne vineyards, organic amendments are used currently to increase soil fertility and to limit soil erosion. Organic amendments may have a direct effect on the retention of Cu in the soil. To assess the influence of the organic management on the fate of Cu in calcareous Champagne vineyard soils, we studied Cu distribution (1) in the soil profile and (2) among primary soil particles, in vineyard parcels with different amendments. Amendments were oak-bark, vine-shoots and urban compost. The results were compared with the amount and the distribution of Cu in an unamended calcareous soil. Physical soil fractionations were carried out to separate soil primary particles according to their size and density. Cu has a heterogeneous distribution among soil particle fractions. Two fractions were mainly responsible for Cu retention in soils: the organic debris larger than 50 μm or coarse particulate organic matter (POM) issued from the organic amendments, and the clay-sized fraction &lt;2 μm. The POM contained up to 2000 mg Cu kg-1 fraction and the clay fraction contained up to 500 mg Cu kg-1 fraction. The clay-sized fraction was responsible for almost 40% of the total amount of Cu in the four parcels. POM was predominantly responsible for the differences in Cu contents between the unamended and the three amended parcels. Our results attested that methods of soil particle-size fractionation can be successfully used to assess the distribution of metal elements in soils. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={The reclamation of burned soils in Mediterranean environments is of paramount importance in order to increase the levels of soil protection and minimise erosion and soil loss. The changes produced in the content of total organic carbon (TOC), N (Kjeldahl) and available P, K, Ca and Mg by the addition of different doses of a municipal solid waste compost to a burned soil were evaluated during one year. The effect of organic amendment on the improvement in the vegetation cover after one year was also evaluated. The organic amendment, particularly at a high dose, increased the TOC and N-Kjeldahl content of the soil in a closely related way. The levels of available K in soil were also enhanced by the organic amendment. Although the effects on all three parameters tended to decrease with time, their values in the amended soils were higher than in the control soil, which clearly indicates the improvement in the chemical quality of the soil brought about by the organic amendment. The available P content did not seem to be influenced by organic treatment, while available Mg levels were higher than in the control during the first 4 months following organic amendment.

abstract={The agricultural sustainability of small-holder agriculture in semi-arid northern Nigeria was assessed. Topsoil (0-30 cm) samples from cultivated and uncultivated soils were analysed for texture, pH, exchangeable cations, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total and available potassium and phosphorus. Comparison of data from cultivated and uncultivated soils revealed that cultivation led to losses of fine soil particles, organic carbon and total nitrogen as well as a reduction in cation exchange capacity and available water-holding capacity. The level of soil clay was shown to have the greatest influence on agricultural sustainability. It is recommended that soil conservation, especially the reduction of soil loss by erosion, should be emphasized in order to enhance agricultural sustainability. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={Nutrient and organic carbon (OC) losses are important components of the soil degradation processes produced by continuous agriculture. It was hypothesized that coarse textured soils will be more affected by cultivation than tine textured ones. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the status of OC, total nitrogen (Nt), and three phosphorous fractions (total inorganic, Pi; organic, Po; and available, Pa) in different textured virgin (under Prosopis caldenia forest) and cultivated soils of the semi-arid pampa of Argentina. Three virgin and non-fertilized cultivated soil pairs, representative from soils of the region, were selected for this study: two tine sandy loam Entic Haplustolls and a sandy Typic Ustipsamment. The element content of each soil was analysed from the < 0.1-mm to 0.1-2-mm sized aggregates. Results indicated that cultivation decreased the OC, Po and Pi contents in tine aggregates of the tine textured soils, and in coarse aggregates of the coarse textured soil. Plant absorption and wind erosion were probably the main processes which decreased element contents in both textural soil types. It was speculated that in the sandy soil the elements lost from tine sized aggregates were restored by the break down of the weak coarse aggregates produced by tillage. The C/N ratios showed mostly small changes due to cultivation, indicating that no changes of organic matter quality occurred. Only the sandy soil showed C/N increases in the tine sized aggregates and decreases in the coarse sized aggregates. The C/Po quotients were not changed by cultivation, indicating that the qualitative composition of P organic compounds remained unchanged. Large OC decreases and Pa increases after cultivation detected in one of the tine textured soil were apparently linked to the occurrence of natural fires. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={Microbiotic soil crusts, mostly formed by cyanobacteria, are widespread on the surface of fallow land in western Niger. They lie adjacent to completely bare soils. We have investigated the structural stability of these soils by testing aggregate breakdown under fast-wetting, slow-wetting and mechanical breakdown. The tests were effected on aggregates ranging from 3 to 5 mm in size. These experiments were completed by micromorphological examinations under light and scanning electron microscope. For all tests, the fragment size distribution and the mean weight diameter (MWD) revealed the great stability of aggregates from soils with a cyanobacterial cover (MWD 1.82 to 3.10 mm), compared to those from soils devoid of cyanobacterial cover (MWD 0.25 to 1.26 mm). Fast- and slow-wetting of microbiotic soil crust material induced a lesser disaggregation of aggregates compared to mechanical breakdown. On the contrary, fast-wetting and mechanical breakdown of aggregates from soils devoid of cyanobacterial cover induced a greater disaggregation than slow-wetting. Microscopic examination of microbiotic crusts revealed an intricate network of filamentous cyanobacteria and extracellular polymer secretions, which binds and entraps mineral particles on the soil surface. Organo-mineral aggregates ranging from 0.10 to 0.12 mm were observed. Below the superficial crusts, filaments and residual organic matter bind tightly soil particles, thus giving a compact structure. The great stability of aggregates of soil with cyanobacterial cover is likely related to the binding and gluing effect of cyanobacteria and derived organic matter. This is consistent with the positive correlation between MWD values and organic carbon content. The present results thereby confirm the resistance to erosion of soil with microbial cover as indicated by field measurements. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The study area is located in the low mountain range of Central Europe (Eifel) and characterized by a marked relief and high game densities. Especially red deer populations, calculated at 20 ind./100 ha, surpass the carrying capacity of the forests observed. Trampling (by red deer and moufflon) and rooting (wild boar) result in extensive soil disturbances, visible as soil profile mixture and soil erosion. We examined eight oak forests (Quercus petraea) located on slopes ranging from 24 to 34°. Four sites are exposed to the southwest (windward) and four sites are exposed to the northeast (leeward), each containing two sites with disturbed and two with undisturbed soils. The content of macronutrients (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+), pH-value and Al3+ content as well as biotic soil properties such as abundance of soil mesofauna (Collembola, Oribatei) were mainly affected by exposition with higher values (lower values for Al3+) at leeward sites. In contrast, organic carbon (Corg) and total nitrogen (N1) of the upper soil depended exclusively on soil disturbance (ANOVA) with lower contents in disturbed soils. Microbial activity and biomass as well as PO43-P and NO3-- N contents were significantly influenced by both factors. We found lower values at disturbed windward sites. The results clearly demonstrate the impact of game on soil degradation especially at windward sites.},

abstract={Field studies on soil properties and processes in southern Saskatchewan have clearly indicated the need to account for both lateral and vertical transfers of components in the landscape for a better understanding of soil dynamics at a given point. Extrapolation of these studies requires greater integration of the site-specific field results with the current generation of process models. In this paper, we use the results of a field study to assess the ability of the CENTURY model to describe the influence of soil redistribution on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. After modifying the erosion input of CENTURY to account for soil deposition, the results from CENTURY were compared to measured SOC levels from a chronosequential study of cultivation effects on SOC levels in southern Saskatchewan. CENTURY closely simulated the effects of soil loss on SOC levels in landform segments with dominantly convex profile (i.e., downslope) curvature. CENTURY estimates of SOC changes for landform segments experiencing soil gain are less comparable to the field results; it overestimated SOC loss after 80 years by 16 Mg ha-1 for depressional complexes and 10 Mg ha-1 for footslope complexes. This leads to a 14% difference in total SOC loss on a landscape-weighted basis (estimated loss based on field data of 36 Mg ha-l versus a CENTURY- simulated loss of 41 Mg ha-1). © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Amino acids and proteins typically form the biggest input of organic-N into most soils and provide a readily available source of C and N for soil microorganisms. Amino acids can also be taken up directly by plant roots, providing an alternative source of available soil N. However, the degree to which plants can compete against the soil microbial population for amino acids in soil solution remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to measure the rate of microbial uptake of three contrastingly charged 14C-labelled amino acids (glutamate1-, glycine0, lysine0.9+) over a wide concentration range (0.1-5 mM) and in two contrastingly managed soils varying in their degree of erosion, organic-C content and microbial biomass. Amino acid uptake was concentration dependent and conformed to a single Michaelis-Menten equation. The mean maximum amino acid uptake rate (Vmax) for the non-eroded (control) soil (high organic-C, high biomass) was 0.13±0.02 mmol kg-1 h-1, while half maximal uptake occurred at a concentration (Km) of 2.63±0.07 mM. Typically, Vmax was fourfold lower and Km twofold lower in the eroded soil (low available organic-C, low biomass) compared to the non-eroded (control) soil. Amino acid substrate concentration had little effect on the proportion of amino acid utilized in catabolic versus anabolic metabolism and was similar for both. While the results obtained here represent the summation of kinetics for a mixed soil population, they indicate that amino acid uptake is saturated at concentrations within the millimolar range. Because the affinity constants also were similar to those described for plant roots, we hypothesized that competition for amino acids between plants and microbes will be strong in soil but highly dependent upon the spatial distribution of roots and microbes in soil.},

abstract={High population density and intensive use of land in Flanders (Northern Belgium) have resulted in a shortage of land to dump dredged sediments. In search of an area efficient solution, a mound was constructed and afforested; 50-114% more dredged sediment per unit area could be discarded by constructing mounds with a height of 6.6 m compared to conventional disposal sites. To prevent erosion, the mound was afforested. Preliminary results of tree growth and changes in soil conditions are demonstrated. Tree survival and height growth are highest in the dominant wind direction sc. the SW-NE axis. On the slopes, parallel with the dominant wind direction, tree mortality up to 80% was observed. The increase of the soil organic carbon content from 3.1 to 3.8% could be partly put down to the growth of tree roots. This increase in organic carbon has far-reaching consequences for potential soil sanitation. The high amount of CaCO3 in the soil protects the mound from internal or external acidification for the next centuries. After four growing seasons, electric conductivity was reduced to the threshold for salt sensitive plants. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The paper deals with Kastanozem formation, with associated dark soils like Vertisols and Calcisols which have thick humic epipedons and with actual erosional processes in the Otjiwarongo region The Kastanozem soil associations occur as patches of several hundreds of hectares. Important pedogenetic factors were fine-grained host sediments, the semi-arid climate, a dense savanna grass cover and geomorphic stability. The Kastanozems show gradual transitions to Calcisols on slopes and on tops due to a decreasing amount of soil-organic matter and increasing carbonate content, and to Vertisols in the lowest positions of the relief due to an increasing amount of smectites in the clay fraction. The dark savanna soils are an important natural resource of the region because they are very fertile and have high water retention capacity. At present soil degradation is the most remarkable process affecting the pedosphere in the study area. In a first phase most of the Kastanozems and Vertisols are buried by slope wash sediments up to several decimeters. Actually this soil association is affected by rill and gully erosion indicating an increased run-off.},

abstract={Severe erosion, initiated by climatic changes during the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene period and resultant declines in dust deposition, causes the formation of waterfalls during the winter floods in many wadi systems in the central Negev desert of Israel. In some areas, erosion of the original loess substrate has been complete, so that the underlying rock has been exposed. We examined the effects of this erosion in four wadis in the central Negev desert on soil nutrients, plant community structure and plant quality. We predicted that erosion has caused reductions in soil nutrients. Reductions in soil nutrients should result in reductions in plant cover. Furthermore, reduced soil nutrient availability should cause reductions in the nutrient status and quality of the plants growing there. In addition to the loss of biodiversity that may result, this erosion may result in economic hardship for the Bedouin peoples whose herds depend on these resources. In this study, there were significant negative effects of erosion on soil organic carbon, nitrate nitrogen and water-holding capacity, but not on soil phosphorus, conductivity or pH. Furthermore, there was a negative effect of soil erosion on an overall measure of soil quality derived from a principal components analysis in three of the four wadis we studied. Erosion resulted in an increase in plant species richness and significantly altered plant community structure in eroded areas of wadis. Increased plant species richness in eroded sites is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis of plant community structure. Plants growing in eroded areas did not differ in two quality indices (nitrogen content and digestibility), although plants typical of eroded areas had significantly lower levels of common digestion inhibitors (total polyphenols) and toxins (alkaloids) than plants from undisturbed sites. These last-mentioned results are contrary to our prediction and are consistent with the notion that plants growing in disturbed (e.g. eroded) sites maximize growth at the expense of investments in defense. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={Soil fertility is closely linked to soil organic matter (SOM), whose status depends on input, i.e., mainly biomass management, and output, i.e., mineralization, erosion and leaching. Preliminary results from runoff plots and lysimeters on hillslopes in West Africa indicated that carbon losses by erosion and leaching ranged between 10 and 100 kg C ha-1 yr-1, depending on annual rainfall and vegetal cover. Under natural conditions, losses may be low enough to be compensated by aerial deposits. But together with mineralization, erosion can locally be an important cause of SOM decrease in cropping systems where there is poor soil cover, steep slopes and erosive rain conditions. The effect of previous erosion on cereal production was assessed in case studies from Rwanda, Burundi, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso. On the densely populated hillslopes of Rwanda, hedges and manure reduced runoff and erosion efficiently, but did not succeed in improving grain yields due to P-deficiency of these ferrallitic soils. In Burundi, under similar conditions but under banana plantation, tree density and mulch cover had a strong influence on erosion; this previous erosion had an important effect on the next maize yield, even when the soils were amended with manure, mineral fertilizers and lime. On sandy ferruginous soils of North Cameroon, erosion increased with increasing tillage intensity. Manure application increased grain yield, but burying organic residues did not improve SOM levels and soil resistance to erosion. Mulching and tillage limited to the plant rows protected the topsoil against erosion, but did not clearly increase the yield. Manuring permitted the restoration of soil productivity, but additional mineral fertilizers (P, N) were needed to reach rapidly a high level of grain production. In the same way, experiments conducted with traditional Zaï system for restoring a degraded Entisol in Burkina Faso showed that runoff harvesting and organic matter input were not sufficient with no additional N and P fertilizers. Complementary experiments in Cameroon showed that a 4-mm selective sheet erosion and a 50-mm non-selective de-surfacing resulted in similar yield decline. Long fallowing, burning and grazing are traditional ways to utilize available biomass in Africa. Considering social habits and technical realities, it seems useful to balance 'grazing-manuring' and mulching in order to protect the soil and maintain its productive capacity. Minimum tillage with mulch (crop residues, weeds or legume fallow) is the new trend used for increasing crop production, with the help of herbicides. Agroforestry that produces good-quality litter is also a part of the solution.},

abstract={Tropical forests of the world are degrading at an alarming rate because of human-induced activities. This study was conducted to determine the consequences of deforestation on the natural regeneration of vegetation and soil quality in tropical, semi-evergreen protected and degraded forest ecosystems of Bangladesh. In each forest ecosystem, 20 matured trees were randomly selected for laid-out experimental plots by placing the tree stand at the center of the plot. The number of vegetative species, height, basal area, crown percentages and species richness were measured. The selected soil properties were determined. The vegetation in the protected forest site was denser with an abundance of species than in the degraded forest site. The primary forest regenerative species were dominated by the dipterocarps in both forest sites. The most alarming difference was that of an abrupt decline in regenerative forest species accompanied by an increase in exotic shrubs, grasses and vines typical of open habitats in the degraded forest site. These shrubs (e.g. Melastaoma, Lantana camara, Clerodendrum infortunatum and Jasminium spp.) and grasses and vines (e.g. Imperata cylindrica, Imperata arundinacea, Mikania scandenes, Saccharum spontaneum and Eupatorium odoratum) are gradually replacing the primary forest regenerative species in the degraded forest site. The soil quality of the degraded forest site has deteriorated over time due to preferential removal of finer particles and organic matter by accelerated water erosion. As a result, natural regeneration of primary forest species, especially dipterocarps, is severely affected by the direct effects of biotic interferences and attendant processes of soil quality degradation from deforestation. In contrast, degraded forest sites under regular protection have shown slow, but gradual, increase in crown frequency, enhanced recruitment and recovery of primary forest species, species abundance, and an improvement in soil quality.

abstract={Although arable landscapes have a long history, environmental problems have accelerated in recent decades. The effects of these changes are usually externalised, being greater for society as a whole than for the farms on which they operate, and incentives to correct them are therefore largely lacking. Arable landscapes are valued by society beyond the farming community, but increased mechanisation and farm size, simplification of crop rotations, and loss of non-crop features, have led to a reduction in landscape diversity. Low intensity arable systems have evolved a characteristic and diverse fauna and flora, but development of high input, simplified arable systems has been associated with a decline in biodiversity. Arable intensification has resulted in loss of non-crop habitats and simplification of plant and animal communities within crops, with consequent disruption to food chains and declines in many farmland species. Abandonment of arable management has also led to the replacement of such wildlife with more common and widespread species. Soils have deteriorated as a result of erosion, compaction, loss of organic matter and contamination with pesticides, and in some areas, heavy metals. Impacts on water are closely related to those on soils as nutrient and pesticide pollution of water results from surface runoff and subsurface flow, often associated with soil particles, which themselves have economic and ecological impacts. Nitrates and some pesticides also enter groundwater following leaching from arable land. Greatest impacts are associated with simplified, high input arable systems. Intensification of arable farming has been associated with pollution of air by pesticides, NO2 and CO2, while the loss of soil organic matter has reduced the system's capacity for carbon sequestration. International trade contributes to global climate change through long distance transport of arable inputs and products. The EU Rural Development Regulation (1257/99) provides an opportunity to implement measures for alleviating ecological impacts of arable management through a combination of cross-compliance and agri-environment schemes. To alleviate the problems described in this paper, such measures should take account of opportunities for public/private partnerships and should integrate social, cultural, economic and ecological objectives for multifunctional land use.},

abstract={Tillage systems are rotated among crops for various reasons, including optimizing yields and managing pest and disease problems. This study indicates that growers in the central and northern Corn Belt regions practice tillage rotation frequently and that the longest average time that 1999 fields were maintained in continuous no-till is slightly less than 2.5 years in Illinois and Indiana and only 1.4 years in Minnesota. Compared with continuous no-till, rotational tillage can prevent or delay improvements in some soil physical and chemical properties (e.g. development of long-term macropores and increased organic matter). However, compared with continuous tillage, rotational tillage does allow for increased protection from soil erosion processes in alternating years. Growers appear to have experimented with no-till practices on a relatively high percentage of the fields as much as 77 percent of the fields sampled in Indiana. This is not surprising given how long crop residue management practices have been promoted by various conservation groups and private industry. No-till practices were developed in the 1950's and were promoted heavily in the early 1980's with the advent of the 1995 Farm Bill and the Conservation Compliance provision that required growers with highly erodible lands to maintain high levels of residue cover in return for continued government subsidy support. But given the relatively high use of rotational tillage, growers apparently are not satisfied with or simply aren't interested in practicing continuous no-till in corn-soybean rotations. While it is not within the scope of the this paper to understand why retrenchment occurs among adoption of certain landuse practices, it is important to realize in the context of improving land conservation that growers don't appear to have the desire and/or ability to use continuous no-till to the degree that may be necessary to sequester substantial amounts of carbon in order to help offset increased greenhouse gas emissions or to manage high levels of residue cover on an annual basis that may be needed to reduce long-term soil erosion rates to below tolerable levels. Producers will adopt continuous no-till practices on cropland where they perceive it is economically and agronomically feasible. The fact that rotational tillage is used widely across the Corn Belt indicates that one or more factors or barriers prevent the use of continuous no-till. Given greater acceptance of no-till soybean practices, particularly in the central and eastern Corn Belt, new or redirected research and extension efforts should focus on improving no-till corn production systems or variations of the no-till design such as strip-till systems that seem to incorporate the efficiencies of no-till systems with fertilizer management and the high yield environments often associated with conventional, full width tillage (Carter, 1994; Randall and Hill, 2000; Wolkowski, 1997). Extension of crop rotations beyond monoculture and two-year corn-soybean rotations can also help improve or alleviate concerns associated with undesirable planting conditions often associated with no-till environments (Griffith et al., 1988; Janovicek et al., 1997). It is unclear, however, whether markets exist that would allow production of crops other than corn and soybeans on significant acreage or whether government programs would encourage or support it. Regardless, long-term conservation goals may not be realized if growers can not or will not use conservation practices on a continual basis, thus allowing interruptions in improvement of soil properties and intermittently allowing soil and environmental degradation to occur.},

abstract={Parametrizing soil reflectance spectra with variables related to specific shape characteristics of the spectral profile permits organic carbon concentrations in soils to be estimated on the basis of regionally validated regression models. An important feature of the approach is that it can not only be applied to continuous spectra but, without notable loss in accuracy, also to the spectral resolution of operational earth observation satellites such as the Landsat-TM or -ETM systems. Using this type of imagery, it can also be shown that soil organic matter is positively correlated to growth conditions for cereal crops in dryland agriculture. Strong correlations with qualitative erosion indicators that can be derived through spectral unmixing approaches demonstrate that soil organic matter is an important indicator for assessing land degradation processes in dry ecosystems from space. ©Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.},

abstract={Accelerated soil erosion can impact upon agronomic productivity by reducing topsoil depth (TSD), decreasing plant available water capacity and creating nutrient imbalance in soil and within plant. Research information on soil-specific cause-effect relationship is needed to develop management strategies for restoring productivity of eroded soils. Therefore, two field experiments were established on Alfisols in central Ohio to quantify erosion-induced changes in soil properties and assess their effects on corn growth and yield. Experiment 1 involved studying the effects of past erosion on soil properties and corn yield on field runoff plots where soil was severely eroded and comparing it with that on adjacent slightly eroded soil. In addition, soil properties and corn grain yield in runoff plots were compared on side-slopes with that on toe-slopes or depositional sites. Experiment 2 involved relating corn growth and yield to topsoil depth on a sloping land. With recommended rates of fertilizer application, corn grain yield did not differ among erosional phases. Fertilizer application masked the adverse effects of erosion on corn yield. Corn grain yield on depositional sites was about 50 per cent more than that on side-slope position. Corn plants on the side-slope positions exhibited symptoms of nutrient deficiency, and the ear leaves contained significantly lower concentrations of P and Mg and higher concentrations of Mn and K than those grown on depositional sites. Corn grain yield in experiment 2 was positively correlated with the TSD. Soil in the depositional site contained significantly more sand and silt and less clay than that on the side-slope position. There were also differences in soil properties among erosional phases. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content was 19·7 g kg-1 in slightly eroded compared with 15·1 g kg-1 in severely eroded sites. Aggregate stability and the mean weight diameter (MWD) were also significantly more in slightly eroded than severely eroded soils. Adverse effects of severe erosion on soil quality were related to reduction in soil water retention, and decrease in soil concentration of N and P, and increase in those of K, Ca and Mg. Severe erosion increased leaf nutrient contents of K, Mn and Fe and decreased those of Ca and Mg. Corn grain yield was positively correlated with aggregation, silt and soil N contents. It was also negatively correlated with leaf content of Fe. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Drylands occupy 40% of the earth's surface and are prone to land degradation. by different processes. Desertification, a vague and qualitative term, implying degradation of soil and vegetation due to anthropogenic activity, reportedly affects 3.6 billion ha of the drylands. Although desertification is most severe in sub-Saharan Africa, the problem is not confined to the developing countries and is also prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions of North America, Australia, and parts of Europe. Degradation of soil and vegetation leads to emission of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O) to the atmosphere. In contrast, improvement of soil quality through adoption of restorative measures can lead to increase in soil organic carbon content, improvement in biomass productivity, and mitigation of the greenhouse effect. Technological options for soil and vegetation restoration depend on ecozone characteristics and need to be validated and fine-tuned for site-specific situations. Restorative technologies include introducing appropriate plant species adopted to harsh environments, controlling erosion and reclaiming salt-affected soils, adopting water harvesting techniques and efficient . irrigation systems. The potential of C sequestration of such measures may be 30 to 200 kg ha-1 y-1 depending on soil and ecozone characteristics. Identification of "trigger spots" may be necessary to set in motion the restorative process. While the potential of C sequestration in drylands may be high (0.9-1.9 Pg y-1), realization of even a fraction of this potential requires a coordinated effort at national and international levels. Development of a policy that involves participation of farmers and land managers is crucial in this endeavor.},

The soils varied in their physical properties and are low in plant nutrients. Nutrient losses in the runoff ranged from 0.010 to 0.109 kg· m-2 with NO3-N, Mg and Ca higher than PO4-P and K. Organic carbon (OC) loss in the eroded sediments is high with values of 0.02 to 2.79 kg·m-2 and correlated positively (r=0.914) with soil OC. Similarly soil available P and exchangeable Ca correlated positively with the eroded sediment values (r=0.682 and 0.826), respectively. Higher enrichment ratio obtained for N and P imply potential environmental consequences like eutrophication of lakes and rivers.},

abstract={In the central highlands of Mexico, heavily eroded soils are often colonized by catclaw (Mimosa buincifiera): an N2-fixing shrub. An experiment was carried out to investigate how this shrub affected characteristics of the soil and its biological functioning. Soil was sampled from outside and under the canopy of catclaw at three sites characterized by different degrees of erosion and an increase in plant density. The soil microbial biomass C, total amounts of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and free-living N2-fixing micro-organisms were measured, while production of CO2 and dynamics of nitrate (NO3/-), nitrite (NO2/-) and ammonium (NH4/+) were monitored in an aerobic incubation at 22±1°C for 35 days. The C content was 1.6 times greater in the area with the largest density of plants and the least erosion (RECUP) compared with the site with the lowest density and greatest erosion (DEGR), while it was 1.2 times greater under the canopy of the catclaw than outside it (average of the three sites). The incorporation of N into the soil organic matter was greater under the canopy of the catclaw than outside it as the C:N ratio was on average 8.4 and 9.1, respectively. The microbial biomass C, as a percentage of soil organic matter, was 1.5 times greater in the RECUP than in the DEGR site. Greatest total number of colony-forming bacteria and fungi (mean of organisms found under and outside the canopy) were found in the RECUP treatment and lowest in the DEGR treatment. Free-living N2-fixing organisms and actinomycetes showed opposite trends. Greater total numbers of colony-forming bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and free-living N2-fixing organisms (mean of the three treatments) were found under the canopy of catclaw than outside of it, Production of CO2 was 1.8 times greater in the RECUP than in the DEGR and 1.6 times greater under the canopy of catclaw than outside. Production of NO3/- was 1.3 times greater in the RECUP than in the DEGR and 3.5 times greater under the canopy of catclaw than outside. There was no significant effect of location or canopy on NO2/- and NH4/+ concentrations. It is concluded that the natural vegetation of catclaw increased microbial biomass and soil organic matter content under, but also outside its canopy, and preserved N better, releasing greater amounts of inorganic N upon mineralization. Catclaw can serve as a first colonizer of heavily eroded soil and be replaced by other vegetation, natural or crops, when fertility is restored.},

abstract={Suspended matter (SM) from the Nyong basin (Cameroon, Africa), a tropical watershed, was collected by tangential flow ultrafiltration to separate particulate (&gt;0.45 μm) and colloidal (&lt;0.45 μm; &gt;20 kDa) fractions. In this basin, two distinctive systems in a selected small catchment (Nsimi-Zoetele) of the Nyong river basin have been considered: (i) colourless water (groundwater and spring) with a low suspended load (&lt;3 mg/l) and a low total organic carbon content (TOC &lt; 1 mg/l) and (ii) coloured water (Mengong brook and Nyong river), which is organic rich (TOC &gt; 10 mg/l) and contains higher amounts of SM (10-20 mg/l) than the colourless water. Freeze-dried samples of SM have been analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Colourless water mainly contains mineral phases, such as poorly ordered kaolinite, plus quartz and goethite in the particulate fraction, and euhedral kaolinite plus amorphous iron oxyhydroxides in the colloidal fraction. In contrast, the SM in coloured water is mainly organic in nature. The mineral phases in the particulate fraction are similar to those from clear water, but with additional phytoliths and diatom frustules composed of biogenic opal. In the colloidal fraction, complexation of Fe3+ and Mn2+ with organic matter is evidenced by EPR, together with significant occurrence of Fe oxyhydroxides associated with organic matter. The sites of Al, Si, Fe, Mn in colloidal fractions derived from spectroscopic analyses are discussed with reference to chemical analyses performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Most of the observed solid phases or species correspond to those expected from published thermodynamic calculations for the same hydrosystem, except the colloidal iron oxyhydroxides in the coloured water. The presence of such iron phases is emphasised since they are expected to have large sorption capacities for numerous trace elements. The crystal chemistry of SM is used to discuss the origin of the mineral particles transported from the soil to the main rivers in terms of mechanical and chemical erosion processes.

abstract={This trans-disciplinary study assesses total external environmental and health costs of modern agriculture in the UK. A wide range of datasets have been analysed to assess cost distribution across sectors. We calculate the annual total external costs of UK agriculture in 1996 to be £2343 m (range for 1990-1996: £1149-3907 m), equivalent to £208/ha of arable and permanent pasture. Significant costs arise from contamination of drinking water with pesticides (£120 m/year), nitrate (£16 m), Cryptosporidium (£23 m) and phosphate and soil (£55 m), from damage to wildlife, habitats, hedgerows and drystone walls (£125 m), from emissions of gases (£1113 m), from soil erosion and organic carbon losses (£106 m), from food poisoning (£169 m), and from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (£607 m). This study has only estimated those externalities that give rise to financial costs, and so is likely to underestimate the total negative impacts of modern agriculture. These data help to identify policy priorities, particularly over the most efficient way to internalise these external costs into prices. This would imply a redirection of public subsidies towards encouraging those positive externalities under-provided in the market place, combined with a mix of advisory and institutional mechanisms, regulatory and legal measures, and economic instruments to correct negative externalities. Further work examining the marginal costs and benefits of UK agriculture would help to inform future policy development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={We examined the effects of treefall gap size and soil properties on microbial biomass dynamics in an undisturbed mature-phase humid subtropical broadleaved forest in north-east India. Canopy gaps had low soil moisture and low microbial biomass suggesting that belowground dynamics accompanied changes in light resources after canopy opening. High rainfall in the region causes excessive erosion/leaching of top soil and eventually soil fertility declines in treefall gaps compared to understorey. Soil microbial population was less during periods when temperature and moisture conditions are low, while it peaked during rainy season when the litter decomposition rate is at its peak on the forest floor. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season (the peak vegetative growth period) limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and, therefore, low microbial C, N and P. Weak correlations were also obtained for the relationships between microbial C, N and P and soil physico-chemical properties. Gap size did influence the microbial nutrients and their contribution to soil organic carbon, total Kjeldhal nitrogen and available-P. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic carbon, microbial N to total nitrogen were similar in both treefall gaps and understorey plots, while the contribution of microbial P to soil available-P was lower in gap compared to the understorey. These results indicate that any fluctuation in microbial biomass related nutrient cycling processes in conjunction with the associated microclimate variation may affect the pattern of regeneration of tree seedlings in the gaps and hence be related with their size.},

abstract={Previous studies in the Manoa watershed (Hawaii) have indicated significant anthropogenic enhancement of trace metals in road deposited sediment and fluvial bed sediments. This study was conducted to examine trace metal loadings with depth in soils of Manoa watershed. A total of 78 roadside (disturbed) and 10 background (control) soils were sampled at two depths for selected soil properties and for total and HCl-extractable (labile) concentrations of Al Cu, Pb, and Zn. Based on sample proximity to roads, typically &lt;2 m, the automobile is considered the primary source of inputs. Concentration, mass loading, and mass per area enrichment ratio (MAER) data indicate that Pb was the most significantly enhanced trace metel. Labile Pb concentrations were log-normally distributed with maximum values of 2870 and 3560 mg kg-1 in topsoil and subsoil samples, respectively. Roadside labile Pb was four to five times higher than in background soils. Mass loading and MAER data indicate that subsoils were statistically more enriched in labile Cu and Pb, while Zn had similar values with depth. More than 50% of the subsoils were classified as having significant to extreme labile Pb anthropogenic signals. Trace metals in this study have undergone significant translocation, possibly through processes of colloidal transport and/or preferential flow. The environmental significance of this research is discussed in terms of potential influence of Pb mobility on ground and surface waters, and the continued contribution of high levels of labile Pb to fond surfaces with erosion of exposed subsoil layers.

The total and extractable concentrations and mass loadings of copper, lead, and zinc were determined at two soil depths in a nonindustrial urban watershed in Manoa, HI. Soil samples were collected at 88 randomly distributed locations within the watershed. Significantly higher topsoil cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, and organic carbon were noted compared to the subsoil samples, while pH and bulk density were higher in the subsoil layers. No statistical differences in Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations were found between the topsoil and subsoil, with Zn found at the highest concentrations, followed by Cu and Pb. Subsoil loadings for total and extractable metals, however, were significantly greater than their topsoil equivalents. Lead and Zn, and to a lesser extent Cu, were anthropogenically enhanced in both the topsoil and subsoil layers. The metal mass per area enrichment ratios for all three metals indicated that the trace metals were mobile and that significant translocation had occurred.},

abstract={We develop a dynamic soil quality model to evaluate optimal cropping systems in the northern Great Plains. Modeling soil quality attributes is feasible, and attribute model results apply to a wide range of soils. A crop production system with continuous spring wheat and direct planting is the most profitable system. This system has low soil erosion and high quality attributes, indicating the benefits of increased soil quality exceed the higher maintenance costs. On-site value of additional soil organic carbon (OC) ranges from $1 to $4/ton OC/hectare/year. These values for soil OC impact the optimum tillage practice, but not the crop rotation.},

abstract={The hydrology and ecological linkages between Khecheopalri lake and its surrounding watershed (area: 12 km2) in Sikkim were investigated to assess the long-term impacts of land-use/cover change on the hydrology of the lake ecosystem and bog formation around the glaciated take. Significant land-use/cover change occurred in the past 4 decades. The bog area expanded by 67%, while the area under agriculture land in the lake watershed grew by 63% between 1988 and 1997. Overland flow was highest on the bare land (4.77% of the precipitation) and lowest in areas of cardamom-based agroforestry (1.79%). Soil and nutrient losses were highest in the cultivated area and least in the cardamom agroforestry system. Sediment loads of 345 Mg year-1 were recorded at the lake inlet and of 316 Mg year-1 at the outlet. Annual soil loss from the lake watershed was 502 Mg km-2 and a net sediment deposition in the lake was 141 Mg year-1. The lake received high nutrient loads (organic carbon of 10.2 Mg year-1, total nitrogen of 1.01 Mg year-1 and total phosphorus of 0.51 Mg year-1) from soil erosion and overland flow. The pH, total phosphorus and bulk density of the peat increased from the lake towards the bog-forest edge. This reflects the trapping of sediments and nutrients around the bog forest margin, although their retention is limited. Agricultural practices should be minimized in the tipper part of the watershed and agroforestry practices should be encouraged to maintain the health and longevity of the lake.

abstract={Soil water availability is most essential in the Sahelian agriculture but is hampered by several factors. Surface crusts or crust-like surfaces, which are characteristic of most Sahelian soils, have been shown to decrease water infiltrability and increase runoff. Their type and structure are influenced by soil texture, vegetation cover, erosion and deposition effects of wind and water. A soil and terrain survey in semi-add SW-Niger was carried out to explain the patterns of soil surface crusts and the deterioration of the land. The soil surface crusts were shown to depend also on specific terrain factors including land use type and intensity, and terrain type and position. Chemical and physical soil factors such as organic carbon, soil colour and texture occurring with specific crusts indicate soil degradation, especially in sloping terrain, which increases runoff and soil erosion. For sandy soils, surface tillage is required to break up the crusts. Higher surface organic matter is recommended to enhance water infiltration in soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Food security in the East African Highlands is dependent upon the productivity of lands managed by smallholders who face difficult challenges in maintaining the fertility of their soils. A study was conducted to identify indicators of soil fertility status that are consistent with farmers' perceptions of soil fertility. Physical, chemical and biological properties of soils were measured from paired fields identified as either productive or non-productive by 12 farmers and compared to findings of a household survey on soil fertility management. Special attention was given to the potential of different soil organic matter fractions to serve as diagnostic indicators of soil fertility. Farmers' criteria for distinguishing soil productivity included crop performance, soil tilth, moisture and colour and presence of weeds and soil invertebrates. All farmers attributed low fertility to inadequate use of organic and inorganic fertilisers (100%) and removal of crop residues (100%). Other causes included continuous cropping (83%), lack of crop rotation (66%) and soil erosion (42%). Productive soils had significantly higher soil pH, effective cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cations, extractable P and total N and P than non-productive soils. Total organic C and several estimates of soil labile C including particulate organic C (POC), three Ludox density separates of POC, KMnO4-oxidizable C and microbial biomass C were significantly greater in productive soils. Soil microbial biomass N, net N mineralisation and soil respiration were also significantly higher in productive soils. Farmers' perceptions of soil quality were substantiated through soil chemical analyses and soil organic matter fractions provided precise information on these differences. The similarity of soil physical properties in productive and non-productive fields suggests that differences in chemical and biological indicators may have resulted, in part, from smallholders' management and are not inherent properties of the soils.

abstract={Technological advances in sugar-cane harvesting and processing is bringing about rapid changes in production systems which could impact on soil physical conditions. An increasing incidence of soil structural decline and depletion of soil carbon levels has increased the risk of soil erosion and crop yield reductions. Soil carbon (C) and aggregate stability were studied on a sugar-cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) green trash blanket trial that had been established on a Chromic Luvisol soil at Mackay, Qld, Australia in 1992. The experiment consisted of blocks with two blocks being harvested early and the remaining two blocks harvested late in the crushing season. Within each block, treatment combinations of trash burnt or green trash blanket, which are either cultivated between rows or not cultivated after harvest, were included. Cropping and cultivation of the soil reduced the different C fractions in the surface 0-100 mm layer by 66-67% when compared to an adjacent uncropped reference soil. The labile C (C(L)) concentration was 11% lower in the burnt treatment compared to the trash returned treatment but the opposite was found for total C (C(T)). After four years, the no cultivation treatment had higher concentrations of all C fractions measured, compared to the cultivated treatment. When compared to the uncropped reference soil, cropping resulted in marked reductions in aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) and aggregates >250 μm and an increase in aggregates <125 μm determined by both immersion and tension wetting. The return of the green trash resulted in a 30% greater MWD and a 28% increase in aggregates >250 μm and an 18% reduction in aggregates <125 μm compared to the burnt treatment when immersion wetting was used. Four years of cultivation reduced the MWD, as determined by immersion wetting, by 26% compared to the no cultivation treatment. No significant correlations were found between any measured C fraction and aggregate stability. This study indicates that sustainable sugar-cane cropping systems will likely be those where cultivation is kept to a minimum and trash is retained in the system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Earlier studies in South Africa had shown that water repellency in the soils of timber plantations was associated with a greater risk of overland flow and soil erosion on mountain slopes. This paper reports on a follow-up study to determine how prevalent water repellent soils are in the forestry areas of South Africa, and to what extent this phenomenon is associated with specific vegetation types. Soils from a representative series of forestry sites around South Africa were sampled from beneath each genus or plantation type and the range of local vegetation types. These soils were dried at low oven temperatures and then subjected to a series of tests of soil wettability, namely, water drop penetration time, infiltration rate, critical surface tension and apparent advancing contact angle as determined by the equilibrium capillary rise test. Water repellency is common in dried soils from timber plantations. The dominant variation in repellency is explained by the different vegetation types: soils beneath eucalypts are most repellent, followed by those beneath wattle (Acacia species), indigenous forest and pine. Soils beneath grassland and fynbos scrub were least likely to show repellency, perhaps because regular fires remove plant litter and thus the potential for hydrophobic substances to develop. Soil characteristics explained very little of the variation in repellency. Organic carbon content was weakly correlated with higher repellency, but organic carbon content and soil texture added little explanation to models that first accounted for variation in vegetation type and point of origin. These results are broadly the same regardless of which method of measuring repellency was used. However, the critical surface tension test was far superior to the others in terms of information gained, speed, efficiency and statistical utility of the resultant scores.

abstract={Soils are an effective sink for carbon storage and immobilization through biomass productivity and enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. The SOC sink capacity depends on land use and management. Degraded lands lose large amounts of C through SOC decomposition, erosion, and leaching. Thus, restoration of disturbed and degraded mine lands can lead to increase in biomass productivity, improved soil quality and SOC enhancement and sequestration. Reclamation of mined lands is an aggrading process and offers significant potential to sequester C. A chronosequence study consisting of 0-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 25-year-old reclaimed mine soils in Ohio was initiated to assess the rate of C sequestration by pasture and forest establishment. Undisturbed pasture and forest were used as controls. The SOC pool of reclaimed pasture sites increased from 15·3 Mg ha-1 to 44·4 Mg ha-1 for 0-15 cm depth and from 10·8 Mg ha-1 to 18·3 Mg ha-1 for 15-30 cm depth over the period of 25 years. The SOC pool of reclaimed forest sites increased from 12·7 Mg ha-1 to 45·3 Mg ha-1 for 0-15 cm depth and from 9·1 Mg ha-1 to 13·6 Mg ha-1 for 15-30 cm depth over the same time period. The SOC pool of the pasture site stabilized earlier than that of the forest site which had not yet attained equilibrium. The SOC sequestered in 0-30 cm depth over 25 years was 36·7 Mg ha-1 for pasture and 37·1 Mg ha-1 for forest. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Soil aggregation is important for maintaining soil surface integrity and allowing water to infiltrate, rather than runoff and cause erosion. The effect of grazing animals on soil aggregation compared with other conservation management strategies in the Southern Piedmont USA is not well known. We tested a hypothesis that grazing animals might negatively affect soil aggregation characteristics. Water-stable macro-aggregates (&gt;0.25 mm), mean-weight diameter, and their stabilities were (i) similar between conservation-tillage cropping and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.) pasture; (ii) similar between 15- to 19-yr-old grazed and hayed hybrid bermudagrass; (iii) 7 to 14% greater in 30-yr-old than in 10-yr-old grazed tall fescue and hybrid bermudagrass pastures; (iv) similar among long-term grazingland, hayland, and forestland; and (v) 5 to 11% lower under cattle grazing than under monthly haying or unharvested management during the first 4 yr following conversion of cultivated cropland to pastureland. Water-stable aggregate distribution at a depth of 0 to 50 mm was 0.30 ± 0.07 g g-1 in the 1.0- to 4.75-mm class, 0.46 ± 0.07 g g-1 in the 0.25- to 1.0-mm class, 0.15 ± 0.02 g g-1 in the 0.05- to 0.25.mm class, and 0.07 ± 0.01 g g-1 in the &lt;0.05-mm class, averaged across management systems and replications (n = 56). Total glomalin of the 1.0- to 4.75-mm dry-stable aggregate class was highly related to whole soil organic C content, but neither of these properties was particularly well related with water-stable macroaggregation, mean-weight diameter, or their stabilities. We conclude, overall, that grazing of pastures in the Southern Piedmont USA has little detrimental effect on soil aggregate distribution and stability and is comparable in soil conservation with other land conservation strategies.

abstract={The geochemical study of surface sediments (vertical profiles of 30-80 cm) from lentic ecosystems of the Tapajos River permit the observation of environmental changes responsible for the mercury contamination of aquatic systems exploited by the human riverine population. The Arapiuns and Amazon rivers are compared. Measurements of mercury, textural indicators (water content and dry density), mineralogic indicators (iron and aluminum associated with oxyhydroxides and aluminosilicates), and organic indicators (carbon, nitrogen, atomic C/N ratio) were performed over the full length of the cores. The results demonstrate that soil erosion is responsible for an increase in surficial sediment mercury concentrations in the different aquatic systems of the Tapajos and Arapiuns rivers. This increase is the result of the relative enrichment of the sedimentary deposits in fine particulates rich in aluminosilicates, oxyhydroxides and mercury, transported in suspension in the water column. The oxyhydroxides of iron and aluminum associated with fine, clayey particles seem to control the accumulation of heavy metals in the sediments of the Tapajos, Arapiuns and Amazon rivers. Overall, the mercury levels in the sediments studied have the same relationship with the aluminosilicates and the texture of the sediments. The quantity of aluminosilicates permits the evaluation of diagenetic effects, the influence of the clay content and the matrix effect on the levels of mercury in sediments. The activity of lead-210 measured in two cores suggests that the superficial sediments originate from eroded soils. A preliminary dating using the constant initial concentration model indicates that the environmental changes recorded in the Tapajos River sediments would have been initiated some time between the 1950s and 1970s. They would then coincide with the important colonization of the Brazilian Amazon during this period. The results presented have important implications for the geochemical interpretation of anthropogenic disturbances in the Amazon. They demonstrate that the recent colonization of the drainage basins and the growing exploitation of new parcels of land in the central Amazon disturb the mineral and organic matter cycles, as well as that of mercury. The ensuing result is increased exportation of fine particulate mercury from the surface of soils to drainage waters that transport them to fluvio-lacustrine systems where they finally settle out.

abstract={Soil organic matter decline and associated degradation of soil and environmental conditions under conventional tillage in tropical and subtropical regions underline the need to develop sustainable soil management systems. This study aimed first to evaluate the long-term effect (9 years) of two soil-tillage systems (conventional tillage: CT, and no-tillage: NT) and two cropping systems (oat (Avena strigosa Schreb)/maize (Zea mays L.): O/M; and oat+common vetch (Vicia sativa L.)/ maize+cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp): O+V/M+C without N fertilization on total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in a sandy clay loam Acrisol in southern Brazil. The second objective was to assess soil potential for acting as an atmospheric CO2 sink. Under NT an increase of soil TOC and TN concentrations occurred, in both cropping systems, when compared with CT. However, this increase was restricted to soil surface layers and it was higher for O+V/M+C than for O/M. The O+V/M+C under NT, which probably results in the lowest soil organic matter losses (due to erosion and oxidation) and highest addition of crop residues, had 12 Mg ha-1 more TOC and 0.9 Mg ha-1 more TN in the 0-30.0 cm depth soil layer, compared with O/M under CT which exhibits highest soil organic matter losses and lowest crop residue additions to the soil. These increments represent TOC and TN accumulation rates of 1.33 and 0.10 Mg ha-1 per year, respectively. Compared with CT and O/M, this TOC increase under NT and O+V/M+C means a net carbon dioxide removal of about 44 Mg ha-1 from the atmosphere in 9 years. NT can therefore be considered, as it is in temperate climates, an important management strategy for increasing soil organic matter. In the tropicals and subtropicals, where climatic conditions cause intense biological activity, in order to maintain or increase soil organic matter, improve soil quality and contribute to mitigation of CO2 emissions, NT should be associated with cropping systems resulting in high annual crop residue additions to soil surface.

abstract={Soil profiles were sampled at 43 sites on granitic parent material at altitudes ranging from 970 to 1300 m in the Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland. Many soils under undisturbed vegetation showed evidence of iron and organic matter translocation with distinctive Bh or Bs horizons. Approximately 50% of the sites sampled had no or partial vegetation cover, due either to human activity (trampling) or active geomorphic processes such as cryoturbation on patterned ground. Exposed cols and summit ridges were most heavily affected by trampling with extensive areas of path development and some erosion. Trampling was principally associated with loss of the upper soil horizons and cryoturbation processes with disturbance of horizon development. Median total organic matter at the vegetated sites ranged from 4.8 to 22.0 kg m-2 with a median of 9.5 kg m-2. There was significantly less total organic matter at the unvegetated sites with median of 4.6 kg m-2 and range from 1.5 to 11.9 kg m-2. There was little difference in total organic matter between sites where vegetation disturbance was due to human trampling or to cryoturbation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Little is known about changes in soil organic C (SOC) and total N with depth and with land use. We conducted this study to determine the depth of changes in SOC and total N under different management regimes in the chernozem soil. Four sites were sampled: a native grassland field (not cultivated for at least 300 yr), an adjacent 50-yr continuous-fallow field, a yearly cut hay field in the V.V. Alekhin Central-Chernozem Biosphere State Reserve in the Kursk region of Russia, and a continuously cropped field in the Experimental Station of the Kursk Institute of Agronomy and Soil Erosion Control. All sampled soils were classified as fine-silty, mixed, frigid Pachic Hapludolls. Soil organic C, total N contents, and bulk densities with depth were compared. Significant reductions in SOC and total N concentrations were detected to a depth of 120 to 130 cm in the 50-yr continuous-fallow field and to a depth of 80 cm in the continuously cropped field. Highest reductions were observed in the top 10 cm of soil, where reduction in SOC ranged from 38 to 43% and reduction in total N ranged from 45 to 53%. Significant losses of SOC and total N per equivalent soil mass on an area basis were observed to a depth of 60 cm in the continuously cropped field and to a depth of 100 cm in the 50-yr continuous-fallow field.

abstract={Heavy metals in dredged sediment disposal sites may be transported through runoff and percolation. In the present study metal fluxes by runoff and percolation were determined under simulated rainfall at a slope of 19% and a rainfall intensity of approximately 40 mm h-1. These circumstances correspond to half the mean annual erosivity of rain under Belgian weather conditions. Surface runoff and percolating water samples were analysed for suspended solids, total dissolved carbon and Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Runoff rate and sediment yields were highest for a silt loam sediment, characterised by a low clay and organic matter content. Metal concentrations in runoff and percolating water varied widely between the sediments studied and were related to the total metal content in the sediment. In runoff and percolating water from the contaminated sediments, metal concentrations strongly exceeded the Netherlands A reference values for ground water quality. Very high metal fluxes were observed for the recently oxidised dredged sediment. Metal transport per unit surface area through percolating water was from two to more than twenty times greater than that in surface runoff.},

abstract={A possible biological component of the explanation for the lack of substantial coal formation on Antarctica between the Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous is hypothesised. Forcing a process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry model with climate model simulations for three successive intervals of the Mesozoic [Late Jurassic (150 Ma), mid-Cretaceous (100 Ma) and Late Cretaceous (65 Ma)], predicts the establishment of productive terrestrial ecosystems with substantial soil carbon pools throughout the land surface of Antarctica between 150 and 65 million years ago. Sensitivity analyses indicate the annual land surface hydrological budget of Antarctica 150-65 Ma was largely balanced due to the effects of canopy transpiration on soil moisture. Post-depositional erosion and tectonic setting must have played an important role in determining coal preservation on the continent. However, the model results indicate that an active vegetated land surface precluded the preservation of the substantial soil organic carbon inputs by minimising the potential for anaerobic preservation (i.e. water logging).

abstract={Soil erosion rates are a key factor for understanding changes in soil organic carbon. 137Cesium was used to estimate erosion rates in long-term cropping experiments in eastern Oregon. Based on the 137Cs measurements, RUSLE or EPIC estimates, and visual observations there is little evidence of water erosion at these experimental sites. Since there is little evidence of soil movement from the experimental sites to explain a steady decline in soil organic carbon (Rasmussen and Albrecht, 1998), then our study supports the conclusion that the major contributing factor for the declining soil organic matter is biological oxidation. The fallow conditions would provide excellent conditions for biological activity by microorganisms. Our study would indicate that under certain conditions biological oxidation is the most important factor for soil organic carbon loss. While there is great potential to sequester carbon in agricultural soils (Lal, et al., 1998), knowing the mechanism of carbon loss from the soil is necessary to determine its fate in the environment. While eroded soil carbon may end up being sequestered in the sediments of lakes and estuaries, biologically oxidized soil carbon will be released directly to the atmosphere as CO2.

abstract={The impact of incorporating animal manure and NPK fertilizer on the yield of maize grown on desurfaced soil was studied in the field. The artificial removal of 0-10 cm of topsoil affected a number of soil properties and reduced maize growth and yield. Desurfacing reduced topsoil thickness, percentage of clay and silt, plant available water capacity and soil organic carbon. The magnitude of the effects of desurfacing on the growth and yield of maize differed among soils incorporated with NPK fertilizer and organic manures. Trends in the decline of maize shoot dry weights and leaf area were: undesurfaced control, desurfaced soil amended with poultry manure, NPK fertilizer, cowdung and desurfaced soil without amendment. The amended soils produced grain yield and harvest indices which were significantly higher than desurfaced soil without amendment.},

abstract={Long-term monitoring is needed for direct assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil, and nutrient loss by water erosion on a watershed scale. However, labor and capital requirements preclude implementation of such monitoring at many locations representing principal soils and ecoregions. These considerations warrant the development of diagnostic models to assess erosional SOC loss from more readily obtained data. The same factors affect transport of SOC and mineral soil fraction, suggesting that given the gain or loss of soil minerals, it may be possible to estimate the SOC flux from the data on erosion and deposition. One possible approach to parameterization is the use of the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) to predict soil loss and this multiplied by the per cent of SOC in the near-surface soil and an enrichment factor to obtain SOC loss. The data obtained from two watersheds in Ohio indicate that a power law relationship between soil loss and SOC loss may be more appropriate. When measured SOC loss from individual events over a 12-year period was plotted against measured soil loss the data were logarithmically linear (R2 = 0.75) with a slope (or exponent in the power law) slightly less than would be expected for a RUSLE type model. The stable aggregate size distribution in runoff from a plot scale may be used to estimate the fate of size pools of SOC by comparing size distributions in the runoff plot scale and river watershed scales. Based upon this comparison, a minimum of 73 per cent of material from runoff plots is deposited on the landscape and the most stable carbon pool is lost from watershed soils to aquatic ecosystems and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Implicit in these models is the supposition that water stable soil aggregates and primary particles can be viewed as a tracer for SOC. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Sustainable use of natural resources continues to gain attention, especially in relation to energy and global carbon cycles. Biomass crops may offset fossil fuels and reduce CO2 contributions to greenhouse gases while improving soil and water quality. We review research on biomass crops, with emphasis on their specific characteristics and how their production can affect soil and water quality. Data from regions throughout the world are included, but the focus is primarily on recent research results from biomass crop production in the United States. Research to date shows promising short-term changes in soil and water quality, but responses vary. Short-term studies have demonstrated increases in surface soil organic-matter content, reduction in erosion and nutrient losses in surface runoff, We conclude that while the potential for benefits is present, data are not yet available to determine the long-term changes in soil quality associated with production of biomass crops.},

abstract={To test the hypothesis that net nitrogen (N) mineralisation is concentrated in the surface few centimetres following minimal soil disturbance for crop establishment, mineralisation was measured during the growth of wheat. The soil was a Red Kandosol located in southern New South Wales. Mineralisation was estimated using in situ incubations inside capped PVC tubes, which were sampled every 3 weeks. Soil from the tubes was sampled at depth intervals of 2 cm to a depth of 10 cm and at 5-cm intervals from 10 to 20 cm. The results showed that net N mineralisation decreased with depth to 20 cm. Over the season, an average of 32% of the N mineralised in the top 20 cm of soil originated from the 0-2 cm layer, 72% was from the 0-6 cm layer, and only 13% was from soil below 10 cm. The decrease in N mineralisation with soil depth was highly correlated with decreases in the organic carbon (r2 = 0.84, P &lt; 0.05) and total N (r2 = 0.83, P &lt; 0.05) concentration. The soil's N-supplying ability is concentrated near the surface where it is susceptible to erosional loss. The N supply may also be inhibited by temperature and moisture extremes, which are common in the surface few centimetres of soil where mineralisation was concentrated. The PVC enclosures created artefacts in soil temperature and moisture, although it is argued that the effects on net N mineralisation were small in most sampling periods.},

abstract={Biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by interactions among factors operating at several spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative importance and interaction of relatively static landscape factors and more dynamic factors in a shortgrass steppe landscape. The landscape factors examined were topographic position, and soil texture. The dynamic factors studied were seasonal climate and the localized effects of individual plants on soils. Patterns were evaluated by sampling soil between and under individual Bouteloua gracilis plants in paired upland (erosional) and lowland (depositional) plots at eight locations at the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), Colorado. We quantified five organic C and N pools (total, fine and coarse particulate organic matter [POM], mineral-associated organic matter [MAOM], and potentially mineralizable C and N), and we estimated seasonal patterns of in situ N dynamics with three methods (extractable inorganic N, net N mineralization in uncovered cores, and N adsorbed on ion exchange resin [IER] bags). Topographic position and soil texture each explained much of the landscape-scale variation of C and N pools and vegetation structure. Most lowland plots were enriched in silt, clay, C, and N relative to adjacent upland plots, and topographic position affected most pools significantly. Most vegetation and biogeochemical variables were strongly correlated with soil sand content. Across the range of sand content encountered (40-83%), the fraction of area in bare soil openings >5 cm across increased sevenfold, and most C and N fractions increased by 2-4.5 times. Plant-induced, microscale heterogeneity of soil C and N was comparable in magnitude to landscape-scale heterogeneity for pools with more rapid turnover (POM and mineralizable C and N), but presence or absence of plants did not affect more stable, mineral-associated organic matter. Plant-induced heterogeneity was significant in all locations, but its importance likely decreases with decreasing sand content as cover becomes more continuous, particularly in lowlands. Total extractable inorganic N and nitrate, N adsorbed on resin bags, and the proportion of mineralized N that was nitrified during incubations increased with increasing soil water content or precipitation, but net N mineralization did not vary systematically with precipitation. Inorganic N availability was greatest during relatively moist spring periods, and these were the only times when indices of in situ N availability followed the spatial patterns expected from laboratory assays of C and N pool distribution. The relatively weak spatial patterns for N dynamics contrast with the substantial landscape and individual-plant scale variation in C and N pools. Landscape patterns of N mineralization and availability may be tied to N pools, such as POM N, that are not strongly related to topography or texture. Particulate organic matter appears to be especially important to N retention and availability on sandy soils, which typify most sites at the CPER; the proportion of total N residing in POM was high and POM C:N ratios were low in sandy upland soils. We suggest that soil texture is a key proximal control over biogeochemical processes and is largely responsible for observed landscape-scale patterns, including topographic differences. Models that integrate effects of texture and topography have the potential to link landscape biogeochemical patterns to short-term processes that directly influence SOM dynamics and to long-term geomorphic processes that influence soil distribution, including eolian redistribution of soil materials, which is important in many dry regions.},

abstract={Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) production has increased in the central Great Plains, but little is known regarding how this crop will affect surface biomass production, various soil quality indicators, and subsequent winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields. We hypothesized that sunflower production was reducing soil quality relative to other summer crops because of the need for tillage to incorporate herbicide, thus reducing surface residue. Our objectives were to quantify on a Weld silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic, Aridic Argiustolls) surface crop residue levels immediately after seeding wheat, subsequent wheat grain yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic matter-carbon (POM-C), aggregate stability, and texture in 3- or 4-year rotation. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used to compare rotations both with and without sunflower. Our data showed 13% lower SOC content and 26% lower POM-C content at the 0- to 5-cm depth in rotations with sunflower versus those without. At the 5- to 15- cm depths, differences were not significant (P < 0.05). Crop residue by mass was 5 times lower and wheat yields 33% lower in rotations with sunflower, but no differences were measured for wind erodible aggregates or texture. Tillage to incorporate herbicides for sunflower and low amounts of residue after sunflower in the 3-year rotation contributed to reduced SOC and POM-C, decreased residue at wheat planting, and reduced wheat yield. If sunflower is to be included in the central Great Plains, efforts should be made to use no-till production practices and 4-year rotations with corn.},

abstract={Failure of soil conservation plans in the subsaharan Africa is partly due to the lack of data on soil erosion hazard. This necessitated studies of runoff, sediment yield and erodibility characteristics of ten soils from different parts of central eastern Nigeria that were evaluated with simulated rainfall. The aim of the study was to obtain information which will aid better soil management. Rainfall intensity of approximately 180 mm h-1 was applied for 60 min to the soils packed in 0.30 x 0.12 x 0.10 m micro runoff plots situated at a slope with 3% inclination. Dry and wet runs were used. The soils varied in texture and are low in organic carbon (OC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Measured soil bulk density ranged from 1.20 to 1.80 Mg m-3. Runoff amount for dry runs varied between 77.6 mm and 235 mm representing between 13.2 and 40.4% of total rain applied. Variation in water infiltration into the soils was attributed to the differences in particle sizes, OC, structural properties and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate iron oxide (Fed) content. The overall soil loss due to splash was between 0.10 and 2.60 kg m-2h-1. Splash losses were higher in dry than wet run indicating that potential erosion hazard due to splash is higher at the inception than the end of rains. Sediment yield of between 0.46 and 9.64 kg m-2h-1 for dry run and between 0.25 and 3.96 kg m-2h-1 for wet run was obtained. These values were also related to clay dispertion index (CDI), dispertion ratio (DR), OC and Fed. Waterstable aggregates greater than 0.5 mm (WSA &gt; 0.5 mm) were found to negatively relate with splash and sediment yield. The measured and calculated erodibility ratings did not agree with the ranking of the soils. However, such parameters as exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), OC, Fed, DR and CDI could be utilized in the prediction of erodibility of these and similar soils.},

abstract={Prince Edward Island (PEI) has a land area of 575,000 hectares and its landscape is undulating. About half the land is cleared, the other half under natural forest. The long term effect of intensive farming practices on soil health is becoming a matter of concern as it is felt that soil quality may deteriorate through continuous agrichemical inputs and loss of productive topsoil through erosion. This study was established to: set up a process to measure soil quality, establish soil quality indicators, measure soil quality on an on-going basis and report results to the public. The sampling locations were selected on a 4 km x 4 km grid across PEI. A total of 232 agricultural sampling locations were selected and located by GPS (Global Positioning System). A cluster of up to five samples was taken at each location, depending on land use. One sample will be taken at the selected GPS coordinates and the other four, 100 metres due south, north, west and east respectively. In the 232 sampling locations selected, the actual number of samples taken will be 796. One third of the sampling locations are being sampled each year, starting in 1998. Three groups of parameters are being measured: Physical Parameters (depth of A and B horizons soil type, length and degree of slope, position of sample on slope, crops grown, crop rotation and type of tillage), Chemical Parameters (Organic Matter, Total Carbon, pH, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Boron, Zinc, Sulfur, Manganese, Iron, Sodium, CEC, and Base Saturation), Microbial Parameters (microscopic observation, enzyme assays). The analyses of the collected data focuses on determining the existence of statistically significant relationships among the measured variables. The methods to be applied include logistic and linear regression, examination of correlations, as well as methods specifically designed for spatial or geographic data. GIS (Geographical Information System) maps of PEI are being be developed to show patterns of the various parameters measured. As data collection proceeds over time, time series methods or longitudinal methods of regression will also be employed to determine if the relationships or associations observed in the initial data hold up over time. This project will provide information to policy makers, researchers and the general pubic about Prince Edward Island current soil quality and the trends in soil quality over time.},

abstract={The aim of this research was to enable erodibility values for hillslope-scale erosion prediction models to be determined from easily measured media properties. Simulated rainfall and overland flow experiments were carried out on 34 soils and overburdens from 15 Queensland open-cut coal mines at The University of Queensland Erosion Processes Laboratory. Properties of the 34 media determined included aggregate stability, Atterberg limits, bulk density, cation exchange capacity, dispersion ratios, electrical conductivity, exchangeable sodium percentage, organic carbon content, pH, texture, and water content at field capacity and wilting point. Correlation and stepwise multiple regression procedures were used to determine those media properties that could best be used to predict rill and interill erodibility. Correlations between media properties and sediment delivery at each of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30% slope revealed that different media properties were correlated with erosion rates at different slopes. A media property could show a strong correlation with erodibility at 30% slope, and a low correlation at 5% slope. Splitting the data set into soils only, and overburdens only, showed that properties that were positively correlated with erosion rates for one group could be negatively correlated for the other group. Therefore, in this study, erodibility could not be explicitly linked to one set of media properties for all medium types and erosive conditions. It was concluded that a single regression equation could not be used to predict erodibility under all conditions. Instead, 4 equations were developed to predict rill and interill erodibility, for soils and overburdens separately. The need for separate regression equations was attributed to the presence of different erosive sub-processes for specific combinations of medium type and slope gradient.},

abstract={Because crop management has a strong influence on soil C, we analyzed results of a 30-yr crop rotation experiment, initiated in 1967 on a medium textured Orthic Brown Chernozem at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, to determine the influence of cropping frequency, fertilizers and crop types on soil organic C (SOC) changes in the 0- to 15-cm depth. Soil organic C in the 0- to 15-cm and 15- to 30-cm depths were measured in 1976, 1981, 1984, 1990, 1993, and 1996, but results are only presented for the 0- to 15-cm depth since changes in the 15- to 30-cm depth were not significant. We developed an empirical equation to estimate SOC dynamics in the rotations. This equation uses two first order kinetic expressions, one to estimate crop residue decomposition and the other to estimate soil humus C mineralization. Crop residues (including roots) were estimated from straw yields, either measured or calculated from grain yields. The parameter values in our equation were obtained from the scientific literature or were based on various assumptions. Carbon lost by wind and water erosion was estimated using the EPIC model. We found that (i) SOC was increased most by annual cropping with application of adequate fertilizer N and P; (ii) that frequent fallowing resulted in lowest SOC except when fall-seeded crops, such as fall rye (Secale cereale L.), that reduce erosion were included in the rotation, and (iii) the fallow effects are exacerbated when low residue yielding flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) was included in the rotation. Some of the imprecision in SOC values we speculated to be related to variations in soil texture at the test site. In the first 10 yr of the experiment, SOC was low and constant for fallow-spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (F-W) and F-W-W rotations because this land was managed in this manner for the previous 50 yr. However, in rotations that received N + P fertilizer and were cropped annually [continuous wheat (Cont W) and wheat-lentil (Lens culinaris L.)], or that included fall-seeded crops (e.g., F-Rye-W), SOC appeared to increase sharply in this period. In the drought period (1984-1988) SOC was generally constant, but large increases occurred in the wet period (1990 to 1996) in response to high residue inputs. The efficiency of conversion of residue C to SOC for the 30-yr experimental period was about 10-12% for F-W, F-W-W and Cont W (+P) systems, and it was about 17-18% for the well fertilized F-Rye-W, Cont W, and W-Lent systems. The average annual SOC gains (Mg ha-1 yr-1) between 1967 and 1996 were 0.11 for F-W (N + P), 0.09 for the mean of the three F-W-W rotations (N + P, + N, + P), 0.23 for F-Rye-W (N + P), 0.32 for Cont W (N + P), 0.12 for Cont W (+ P), and 0.28 for W-Lent (N + P). The corresponding mean estimated (by our equation) annual SOC gains for these rotations, were 0.06, 0.10, 0.16, 0.22, 0.14, and 0.22 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Because soil C measurements are usually so variable, we recommend that calculations such as ours may be employed to assist in the interpretation of measured C trends and to test if they seem reasonable.},

abstract={Soil accretion, sediment deposition, and nutrient (N, P, organic C) accumulation were compared in floodplain and depressional freshwater wetlands of southwestern Georgia, USA to evaluate the role of riverine (2600 km2 catchment) versus depressional (&lt; 10 km2 catchment) wetlands as sinks for sediment and nutrients. Soil cores were collected from three floodplain (cypress-gum) and nine depressional (three each from cypress-gum forest, cypress-savannah, and herbaceous marsh) wetlands and analyzed for radionuclides (137Cs, 210Pb), bulk density, N, P, and organic C to quantify recent (30-year) and long-term (100-year) rates of sediment and nutrient accumulation. There was no significant difference in organic C, N, or sediment accumulation between depressional and floodplain wetlands. However, P accumulation was 1.5 to three times higher in the floodplain (0.12-0.75 g/m2/yr) than in the depressional wetlands (0.08-0.25 g/m2/yr). Sediment and nutrient accumulations were highly variable among depressional wetland types, more so than between depressional and floodplain wetlands. This variability likely is the result of differences in historical land use, hydrology, vegetation type, NPP, and perhaps fire frequency. Mean (n = 12) one-hundred-year rates of sediment deposition (1036 g/m2/yr), organic C (79 g/m2/yr), N (6.0 g/m2/yr), and P accumulation (0.38 g/m2/yr) were much higher than 30-year rates (sediment = 118 g/m2/yr, C = 20 g/m2/yr, N = 1.5 g/m2/yr, P = 0.09 g/m2/yr). Higher 100-year (210Pb) sediment and nutrient accumulations likely reflect the greater numbers of farms, greater grazing by livestock, and the absence of environmentally sound agricultural practices in southwestern Georgia at the turn of the century. Our findings suggest that the degree of anthropogenic disturbance within the surrounding watershed regulates wetland sediment, organic C, and N accumulation. Phosphorus accumulation also is greater in floodplain wetlands that have large catchments containing fine textured (clay) sediments that are co-deposited with P.},

abstract={Soil erosion, which is a widespread problem in semiarid areas, may lead to a decline in soil productivity since the finest and most fertile soil particles are those which are generally removed. Our objective was to determine the distribution of soil organic matter, phosphorus, potassium and cation exchange capacity within the fine fractions (< 2 μm and 2-20 μm) of the soil. Samples were taken from the top 20 cm of 14 cultivated soils and six forest soils. The organo-mineral size fractions from soil samples were isolated without chemical pretreatment by ultrasonic dispersion in water followed by sedimentation-syphonation. The distribution of organic matter within size fractions varied with land use. The cultivated soils had a greater percentage (on average, about 30%) of total soil C in the < 2 μm fraction than the soils under natural vegetation (on average, about 18%), in which the total soil C was associated with the 2-20 μm fraction to a greater extent than in cultivated soils. The distribution of the soil N between the clay and fine silt size fractions followed a similar pattern to that shown by soil C. The C/N ratio became smaller as particle size decreased. The higher C/N ratio obtained for the 2-20 μm fraction for both forest and cultivated soils suggests the presence of less decomposed organic matter, while the organic matter associated with the < 2 μm fraction can be considered to be more humified. The cation exchange capacity of whole soil and organo-mineral fractions were closely correlated with their respective C contents. The clay-size fraction had the highest CEC, which was related to its mineralogical composition. The data confirm that the proportion of soil organic matter depends on the stabilizing capacity of the different size fractions, both the clay and fine silt size fractions playing an important role in semiarid soils. To the detriment of the soil's organic matter content these fractions are easily eroded in soils under arid and semiarid conditions, which may render them unsuitable for agricultural purposes.},

abstract={Sewage sludge is being applied to alkaline saline soil of the former Lake Texcoco (Mexico) as part of a scheme to vegetate the land and prevent erosion by wind. However, its effect on the microbial functioning of the soil is unknown. We investigated under laboratory conditions the decomposition of sewage sludge and its effect on carbon and nitrogen mineralization and ammonia (NH3) volatilization. Soil was sampled from four locations, one undrained and three drained, for 1, 5 and 8 years. The samples were divided into two groups, one of which was amended with sewage sludge, and were aerobically incubated for 70 days at 22 ± 1 °C. The microbial biomass activity in the unamended soil, as indicated by CO2 production as a percentage of total soil organic C, was inhibited neither by high pH nor by large salt concentrations. Addition of 1.5g of dry sewage sludge kg-1 dry soil, equivalent to 200 mg C kg-1, increased CO2 production significantly in the soil with the least soil C content and lowest pH, which had been drained for 8 years. It did not influence production of CO2 in the soil from the other treatments even when 1000 mg sewage sludge C kg-1 was added. Volatilization of NH3 increased with soil pH and application of sludge. Concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- decreased in the first 7 days and tended to increase again after 28-42 days. We conclude that the microbial activity of the soil was not affected by high pH and salt concentration but the soil was deficient in N. The organic material added with the sewage sludge was sequestered and thus unavailable for microorganisms.},

abstract={Continuous cropping or decreasing Ihe frequency of summer fallow (F) in cereal-based dryland rotations may have benefits other than greater water utilization and erosion control. We hypothesized that rotations with no fallow or minimum fallow frequency can produce more biomass and cover than the traditional winter wheat (Trilicum aestirum L.)-summer fallow systems (W-F), and ultimately, greater amounts of soil organic matter (SOM). To this end, we evaluated changes in various pools of SOM at the 0- to 5- and 0- to 15-cm depths on a Weld loam (fine, smectitic, mesic aridic Palcustolls) that were caused by (i) decreasing fallow or increasing cropping intensities, (ii) specific rotations of the same length but with different crop sequencing, and (iii) accumulated residue and roots from reduced- or notillage from 1993 to 1997. Total soil organic carbon (SOC) and N for the 0- to 5-cm depth increased by ≈20% with continuous cropping rotations compared with YV-F rotations. Participate organic mattercarbon (POM-C) doubled, while POM-N, and soluble organic C (OC) increased by one third for the same comparison. At the 0- to 15-cm depth, SOC, POM-C, and POM-N did not differ among systems with fallow, nor among systems with cropping intensities greater than W-F. Thus, significant differences always existed between W-F and continuous cropping. Generally, fallow had a negative influence on SOC accumulation, and continuous cropping a positive influence on surface SOM. Changes in SOC did not correlate with yields in the five-year comparison of this ongoing study.},

abstract={In the contemporary denudation system of the temperate zone, fluvial transport plays a fundamental role in carrying material from erosion and denudation in a catchment. The main factor that is responsible for the flow of dissolved material in a catchment and its supply to river channels is the nature of flow pathways. The various forms of feeding a river channel, together with the availability of dissolved substances (Fig. 1), are of fundamental significant for the time of material supply from the catchment of the river channel as well as for the magnitude and dynamics of transport. The aim of the present study was to gain an insight into the nature and dynamics of the flow of dissolved substances in an environmentally heterogeneous postglacial catchment. Temporal changes in the concentrations of selected chemical parameters of the Kluda river were used in natural geochemical indicators of the variability of chemical denudation processes in a postglacial catchment in the temperate zone. The field research was conducted in a small catchment (10.7 km2) drained by the Kluda river, a fourth-order stream (by the Horton-Strahler classification). It is a part of the upper Parseta hydrographic system (Fig. 2), which is considered representative of the postglacial lakeland zone of West Pomerania and the Polish Plain. The study is based on hydrological and hydrochemical data from four hydrological years 1990-1993. Hydrological measurements were carried out at a water-gauging station located on the 6.5th kilometre of the Kluda. The variability of solute transport was determined on the basis of 83 periodic measurements taken in the water-gauging profile closing the Kluda catchment (Fig. 2, 3). The results obtained can be considered representative of low and medium discharges in the Kluda. The Kluda water belongs to the bicarbonate-calcium type, according to Monition's classification (Macioszczyk 1987), which is characteristic of postglacial lakelands built of deposits rich in calcium carbonate. The periodic observations of the physico-chemical parameters of the stream water show low variability of total mineralisation and the concentration of ionised silica as well as calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate ions. The slight changes in the concentrations of compounds dissolved in the Kluda water indicate that in the range of discharge registered during the research it is fed predominantly by groundwater. The high permeability of deposits, retentivity of the substratum and minearl-organic deposits with a high groundwater level make it easy to 'push out' the water present in the catchment before precipitation, i.e. the 'old' water. In a catchment of low relief, with thick soils and an important role of groundwater flow, like that of the Kluda catchment, only a small proportion of variation in concentration may be explained by discharge. The high retentiveness of the catchment system accounts for the absence of direct links between the magnitude of precipitation, the discharge, and water chemistry in the river channel. The concentration-discharge relationships over long periods may alalso be obscured by seasonal fluctuations due to biological or geochemical processes. Other factor that may control those relations include: - seasonal variations in ion concentrations resulting from their role in the biological cycle, - the chemical composition of precipitation water and the activation of dry deposition, - the feeding by water from the overland flow and throughflow, since it is enriched with compounds coming from short-term and seasonal washout of salts (see Foster and Walling 1987, Klein 1981), the magnitude of washout from the ground surface or soil profile, according to Klein (1981), is a function of the duration of rainless periods. - effects of hysteresis (cf. Edwards 1973, Foster 1980, Froehlich 1982, Kostrzewski et al. 1992, Foster and Walling 1978, Walling and Webb 1986), which often explain why the connection between the ion concentration and the discharge is absent or only loose, especially when we deal with seasonal measurements that do not embrace entire flood events. Studies of the water circulation and leaching are usually carried out in Poland in mountainous and upland areas with thin layers of skeletal soil and the river discharge controlled by the overland flow, throughflow, or flow from shallow-seated aquifers. The results presented in this study are representative of postglacial environments with highly variable geological structure, permeable deposits, thick soil profiles, and high retentiveness of catchments. These conditions alter fundamentally the time and pathways of water circulation, the spatial and temporal variability of fluvial transport, and also the intensity of denudation.},

abstract={Improvement in soil quality to maintain high production and reduce negative environmental impacts is necessary for alternative crop production strategies to become socially acceptable and viable in the long-term. No-tillage (NT) management of the predominantly small grain region of western Canada has the potential to curb soil erosion and increase profitability. An understanding of the direct effects of NT on soil properties is necessary to evaluate its potential for sustained long-term productivity. We have compiled data collected from two sites in northern British Columbia to ascertain the long-term effects of conventional tillage (CT) and NT on soil components thought to be important in surface soil structural improvement. Soil water retention was greater under NT compared with CT without dramatically altering bulk density due to redistribution of pore size classes into more small pores and less large pores. Soil organic C was greater under NT than under CT nearest the soil surface. Water-stable aggregation improved under NT compared with CT, perhaps because more soil organic C was sequestered within macroaggregates under NT compared with CT that helped to stabilize these aggregates. Steady-state water infiltration was greater under NT than under CT as a result of soil structural improvements associated with surface residue accumulation and lack of soil disturbance. Barley (Hordeum vulgave L.) yield tended to be greater under NT than under CT in years of low rainfall as a result of improvements in soil water retention and transmission that may have provided a better environment for root development. Our data indicate that NT is a viable management strategy to improve soil quality in the cold, semiarid region of western Canada. This strategy could lead to high production, minimal negative environmental impacts, and a socially-acceptable farming system.},

abstract={Soil erosion can adversely influence soil quality, especially in tropical soils. Thus, a multi-location field experiment was conducted on eight major agricultural soils with different degrees of erosion, in three eco-regions in Tanzania. The objective was to assess the impact of topsoil depth (TSD) and management on soil properties. Three eco-regions comprising of humid at Kilimanjaro, sub-humid at Tanga and sub-humid/semi-arid at Morogoro were selected. There were a total of eight locations within three eco-regions comprising two at Kilimanjaro (e.g., Kirima Boro and Xeno Helena), two at Tanga (Mlingano 1 and Mlingano 2) and four at Morogoro (Misufini 1, Misufini 2, Misufini 3, and Mindu). The soil management treatments consisted of farmyard manure (FYM), N and P fertilizer, tie-ridging and farmers' practice. Plant nutrient content was generally lowest on severely eroded and the highest on least eroded soil classes. Soil pH decreased with increasing severity of erosion on soils of with higher content of Ca+2 in the sub-surface. In general, there occurred a decline in soil organic carbon (SOC) and P with the decrease in TSD. The SOC content decreased on severely eroded soil class by 0.16%, 0.39% and 0.13% at Misufini 1, Mlingano 1 and Kirima Boro, respectively, compared to slightly or least eroded soil class. Corresponding decline in available P at these sites was 41%, 62% and 61%, respectively. Application of FYM significantly increased soil pH at some sites. Soil content of SOC, N, P, K and Mg were significantly increased by FYM application. Significant effects of N and P fertilizers on SOC and P were observed at most sites. In comparison with farmer's practice, FYM application increased SOC by 0.55%, N by 0.03%, P by six-fold and K by two-fold. Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers had comparable effects for SOC and P only at some sites. The results indicate that FYM is a better soil input than N and P fertilizers in improving soil quality. The data show that SOC, N and P are most adversely affected with accelerated erosion and that FYM fertilizer applications have the potential to improve fertility of eroded soils.},

abstract={The long-term carbon cycle is the cycle that operates over millions of years and that involves the slow exchange of carbon between rocks and the surficial system consisting of the ocean, atmosphere, biota, and soils. It is distinguished from the short-term carbon cycle, in which carbon is rapidly exchanged only within the surficial system. A new type of diagram illustrates the cause-effect relations involved in the long-term carbon cycle and how these processes affect the levels of atmospheric O2 and CO2. The diagram also includes the cycle of phosphorus as it affects the burial of organic matter in sediments. The diagram is distinctly different from, and is here compared to, the more traditional representation of geochemical cycles in terms of box models. By following paths leading from causes to effects, one can trace complex loops that demonstrate positive and negative feedback,and this allows discovery of new subcycles that deserve further study. This type of diagram should be applicable in general to other geological and geochemical processes.},

abstract={Crop residues left on the soil surface after harvest are effective in reducing erosion; however, when subjected to rainfall-leaching, the residues are a significant source of soluble nutrients to agricultural runoff. Nutrient leaching from crop residues as a function of rainfall intensity, and residue loading rate, was studied in a series of laboratory experiments under controlled conditions. Using a multiple-intensity rainfall simulator corn (Zea mays L.) stover placed on a nylon screen at an equivalent field loading rate of 10 t ha-1, was subjected to simulated rainfall at intensities of 6, 12, 25, 51, and 99 mm h-1. In another series of experiments, simulated rainfall was applied at 25 mm h-1 to four stover loading rates of 5, 7, 10, and 15 t ha-1. In both experiments, leachate was sampled as a function of time and analyzed for PO4-P, NH4-N, NO3-N, and total organic carbon (TOC). Nutrient concentrations and losses were generally greater at the lower rainfall intensities and higher stover loading rates. In each study, nutrient concentrations decreased hyperbolically with either time or cumulative leachate volume. For all loading rates and rainfall intensities, nutrient amounts (kg ha-1) leached from the stover followed the order C &gt;&gt;N = P; however, the amounts of N as (NH4-N + NO3-N) or C leached were ≤1.5% of total nutrient in residue compared with 2.8 to 6.0% of total nutrient in residue for P. Stover exposed to field conditions over time showed leaching kinetics similar to freshly collected residues.},

abstract={Potential C and N mineralization and soil microbial biomass C were determined following disturbance (i.e. drying and sieving) pretreatments in five soils varying in texture (30-350 mg clay g-1 soil) from the southern Piedmont USA. Soil disturbance by drying (i.e. rewetting following drying at 55°C for 72 h) of intact soil cores resulted in a flush of C mineralization (70% to 2.5-fold greater) during 0-3 d of incubation, but was not significantly different during 3-10 and 10-24 d periods compared with field-moist-intact soil cores. Soil disturbance by sieving resulted in greater C mineralization earlier than later in the incubation and led to significant immobilization of N of surface soil where respiration was highest. Increasing soil disturbance through smaller sieve openings resulted in a 10-60% greater flush of C mineralization that may have been due to disruption of macroaggregates, which protected soil organic C. With a conditioning period of 10 d following rewetting of dried soil, soil microbial biomass C was unaffected by drying or extent of sieving. Soil texture (i.e. clay content) did not interact with disturbance effects. Immobilization of N was predominant in surface soils (0-40 mm) of this bermudagrass pasture, where mineralizable C was very high. Carbon mineralization during 0-3 d was highly related (r2 = 0.96 ± 0.04) to C mineralization during 0-24 d, basal soil respiration and soil microbial biomass C, although increasing soil disturbance (i.e. drying and extent of sieving) altered these relationships in a predictable manner. I conclude that dried and coarsely sieved soil compares favorably to field-moist-intact soil cores for estimating soil microbial biomass and potential activity in landscapes scoured by various degrees of erosion.},

abstract={Sustaining soil fertility under agricultural intensification and expansion onto marginal lands is a significant challenge in the Nepalese Middle Mountains. In a detailed watershed study it was shown that the overall soil fertility is poor, forest soils display the poorest conditions as a result of biomass removal, and sustaining agriculture is questionable due to the transformation from traditional to multiple cropping systems. Parent material is a significant factor influencing low phosphorus status while insufficient inputs create deficiencies in total carbon, nitrogen and bases. A nutrient budget model was developed to assess inputs, redistribution and losses relative to soil fertility. Yield, input and management data obtained from farm interviews, find soil analysis data were used in the calculation of nutrient budgets. Results from modelling indicate declining soil fertility under rainfed agriculture, forest and rangelands, and marginal conditions under irrigated agriculture subject to intensive cultivation. Nutrient deficits were relatively low for irrigated rice-wheat systems, which benefit from nutrient inputs via sediments and irrigation waters, but the introduction of triple cropping showed greater deficits. Nutrient balances were most critical under rainfed maize production where 94% of the farms were in deficit. Current shortages of organic matter make elimination of nutrient deficits problematic but improvement of composting, biological N-fixation and fertilizer efficiency and reducing erosion were found to be potential options.},

abstract={Chemical and physical degradation of Red Ferrosols in eastern Australia is a major issue necessitating the development of more sustainable cropping systems. This paper derives critical concentrations of the active (permanganate-oxidisable) fraction of soil organic matter (C1) which maximise soil water recharge and minimise the likelihood of surface runoff in these soils. Ferrosol soils were collected from commercial properties in both north and south Queensland, while additional data were made available from a similar collection of Tasmanian Ferrosols. Sites represented a range of management histories, from grazed and ungrazed grass pastures to continuously cropped soil under various tillage systems. The concentration of both total carbon (C) and C1 varied among regions and farming systems. C1 was the primary factor controlling aggregate breakdown, measured by the percentage of aggregates <0.125 mm (P125) in the surface crust after simulated rainfall. The rates of change in P125 per unit change in C1 were not significantly different (P < 0.05) for soils from the different localities. However, soils from the coastal Burnett (south-east Queensland) always produced lower P125 (i.e. less aggregate breakdown) than did soils from the inland Burnett and north Queensland locations given the same concentration of C1. This difference was not associated with a particular land use. The 'critical' concentrations of C1 for each region were taken as the C1 concentrations that would allow an infiltration rate greater than or equal to the intensity of a 1 in i or 1 in 10 year frequency rainfall event of 30 min duration. This analysis also provided an indication of the risk associated with the concentrations of C1 Currently characterising each farming system in each rainfall environment. None of the conventionally tilled Queensland Ferrosols contained sufficient C1 to cope with rainfall events expected to occur with a 1 in 10 frequency, while in many situations the C1 concentration was sufficiently low that runoff events would be expected on an annual basis. Our data suggest that management practices designed both to maximise C inputs and to maintain a high proportion of active C should be seen as essential steps towards developing a more sustainable cropping system.},

abstract={CRP lands in eastern Washington were eligible for dryland cropping production as of 1995. Conservation and conventional take-out practices were assessed at eight sites throughout eastern Washington to determine changes in soil quality parameters. The trials tested different tillage options: direct-seed/spring plant (DSP), conventional tillage/spring take-out (CSP), or conventional tillage/summer fallow (CSF). The eastern Washington sites range in annual precipitation from 23 to 36 cm (?? to ?? in) and in soil organic matter from 1.06 to 2. 60%. Microbial biomass, readily-mineralized carbon (RMC), dehydrogenase activity, pH, organic matter content (OM), nitrate and ammonium concentrations, moisture, bulk density, and aggregate stability were monitored from 1995 to 1996. Results showed that RMC and pH were lower after one year in conventionally-tilled plots as compared to CRP grassland. The direct-seed samples were more like CRP grassland with respect to pH, dehydrogenase activity, and RMC than conventional tillage treatments.},

abstract={The stability of soil aggregates against water erosion is a largely unstudied factor in research on the spatially-distributed impacts of tropical forestry. Soil strata with particularly weak aggregates are likely to be the focus for erosional activity whether buried or exposed by either natural processes or forestry activities. Understanding the location and likely cause of such intrinsic instability would, therefore, allow better spatially-distributed parameterisation of erosion models. This study has aimed to identify the range in aggregate stability within a region of Bornean Ultisol disturbed by forestry operations, and to identify the bulk soil properties associated with such stability variations. The sites sampled were subject to a range of denudational processes including piping, rilling and landslide-triggered erosion. Soil profiles with rates of erosion in excess of 10 mm a-1 were shown to have less aggregate stability (as characterised by the rainfall simulation survival index (RSSI)) than those with no visible signs of erosion. Further, large differences in aggregate stability between soil horizons of the same profile were observed and seen to be statistically correlated with the bulk soil properties of organic carbon and clay content (i.e. stabilising agents) and the dispersing agent of exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) at sites undergoing erosion. Organic carbon appeared to be the most important governing factor, accounting for 56% of the variance in the aggregate stability. The presence of strongly and weakly expanding 2 : 1 clays within the soils may have been an additional de-stabilising factor. Reduced porosity was also observed at eroding sites with weak soil aggregates. The properties of EC25 and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were not correlated with the RSSI or the presence of soil erosion. Identification of the role of organic carbon, clay and ESP in the stability of these tropical forest aggregates is important in focusing future, more intensive research on the spatial parameterisation of models to simulate forestry impacts on erosion.},

abstract={In Canada and the United States approximately 82% of the annual total dose of radiation to any person comes from terrestrial and cosmogenic sources. The soil is also the main source of radon exposure to humans. Therefore it is important to know the background levels of natural and anthropogenic radioactivity in soils. In this study the radionuclides 40K, 226Ra, 232Th and 137Cs were measured in the soils of southwestern Ontario in order to determine the background levels and to understand the soil profile distribution. Clay content is the most important variable affecting the background levels of 40K, 226Ra, and 232Th in the soil. The profile distribution of these radionuclides is further influenced by pedogenic processes, particularly carbonate leaching from the solum and clay illuviation from the Ae to the Bt horizons. The lateral and vertical distribution of bomb-fallout 137Cs is influenced by soil management such as tillage, biopedoturbation by soil animals such as earthworms and groundhogs, soil erosion and soil organic matter cycling. Multiple regression analysis showed that clay content, sand content, percent CaCO3, pH and organic carbon content had variable influences on each of the radionuclide contents in the soil.},

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of how energy crop cultivations in Sweden, consisting of short-rotation forest (Salix) and energy grass (reed canary grass), can be located and managed to maximise environmental benefits. The overall conclusion is that substantial environmental benefits, ranging from global to site-specific, could be achieved when traditional annual food crops produced with current agriculture practices are replaced by dedicated perennial energy crops. The emission of greenhouse gases could be reduced by reduced Carbon dioxide emissions from organic soils, by reduced nitrous oxide emissions caused by the use of fertilisers and through accumulation of soil carbon in mineral soils, which also leads to increased soil fertility. Nutrient leaching could be reduced by using energy crop cultivations as buffer strips along open streams and wind erosion could be reduced by using Salix plantations as shelter belts. Cultivation Of Salix and energy grass can also be used to purify municipal Waste, such as waste water, landfill leachate, and sewage sludge. Furthermore, the content of heavy metals in the soil can be reduced through Salix cultivation. The biodiversity is estimated to be almost unchanged, or slightly increased in open farmland. These environmental benefits, which could be achieved on up to 60% of current Swedish arable land and last for 25 years or more, will increase the value of the energy crops. The economic value of these benefits is calculated in Part II of the analysis, which is presented in a second paper.

abstract={The fate and persistence of PCBs 28, 52, 101, 138, and 180 artificially introduced into three soils was studied under a variety of field conditions for up to 415 d following initial contamination. A relationship was detected between In Koa (octanol/air partition coefficient) and the experimentally observed first-order loss rate constant that was statistically significant at at least the 90% level in all but one instance. In nearly all experiments, PCB persistence was greater in soils of higher organic carbon content. Soil temperature and moisture content were also indicated as important influences on persistence. Significantly longer half-lives were observed in a soil in which initial PCB contamination had occurred ca. 1 year previously. A mass balance showed the most likely mechanism of loss to be volatilisation. Losses attributable to aerobic biodegradation could not be ruled out, but those due to leaching, uptake by biota, and soil erosion were demonstrated to be negligible. First-order rate constants (kv) were determined for volatilisation of the same congeners from soil under a variety of controlled laboratory scenarios. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) showed the most important influences on kv to be ln Koa (adjusted for soil temperature) and soil organic carbon content. Limited evidence was observed for a relationship between kv and soil moisture content, but not water flux. When tested against field measurements, the MLRA-derived relationship between kv and independent variables predicted to within a factor of 2.5, the persistence of PCBs 28, 52, and 101. However, it did not account for the influence of the age of contaminant association with the soil, soil moisture content or water flux, and failed to function for soils of high organic content, or where ln Koa exceeds ca. 23.},

abstract={Although approximately 1.3 million ha of mixed Solonetzic- Chernozemic landscapes are cultivated in Saskatchewan, little information is available on the effects that agriculture has had on the quality of these soils. At our research site in southwestern Saskatchewan a clear landscape-scale pattern of soil distribution occurred. Regosolic and thin Chernozemic soils were associated with the long, gentle (2-5%) slopes and Solonetzic-influenced soils were associated with higher catchment area footslope and depressional positions. High rates of soil loss occurred throughout the landscape - overall a net soil loss of 31 Mg ha yr-1 was calculated using 137Cs redistribution techniques. No net depositional sites were observed in the 45 sampling points in the landscape, suggesting that the site was dominated by wind erosion. The high rates of loss were consistent with very low levels of soil organic carbon storage (37 to 46 Mg ha-1 to 45 cm) at all slope positions in the landscape and with the occurrence of sub-soil features in the plough layer. The Solonetzic-influenced soils occupy 38% of the site and have high sodium adsorption ratios (from 18 to 38 in the B horizon) and high soil resistance values as determined with a penetrometer. For the Solonetz and Solodized Solonetz soils these growth-limiting properties occur immediately below the 10-cm plough layer and may constitute a largely irreversible decrease in their productive capacity.},

abstract={Soil emission of CO2 is closely linked to soil degradation, decrease in soil organic carbon (SOC) content and decline in soil quality. Enhancing soil quality through adoption of best management practices (BMPs) and soil restoration can increase SOC content and soil productivity, and partially mitigate the greenhouse effect. The C sequestration potential through judicious management of world cropland includes 0.08-0.12 Pg/yr by erosion control, 0.02-0.03 Pg/yr by restoration of severely degraded soils, 0.02-0.04 Pg/yr by reclamation of salt-affected soils, 0.15-0.175 Pg/yr by adoption of conservation tillage and crop residue management, 0.18-0.24 Pg/yr by adoption of improved cropping system and 0.30-0.40 Pg/yr as C offset through biofuel production. The total C sequestration potential of the world cropland is about 0.75-1.0 Pg/yr or about 50% of annual emission of 1.6-1.8 Pg by deforestation and other agricultural activities. This finite soil-C sink could be filled over a 20 to 50-year period, during which energy related emission reductions gradually take effect at global scale. Improving soil quality is a win-win strategy, while increasing productivity it also improves environment and partially mitigates the greenhouse effect. Intensification of farming and increasing biomass production can lead to increased sequestration of C in soils, and to partly meet commitments under the Kyoto Protocol at national and global scales. Global reduction in C emission may have to be substantial if the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is to be stabilized at 550 ppmv. However, realization of this potential would require developing channels of communication between scientists and land managers and policy makers, and providing economic incentives.},

abstract={Some typical features of soil organic matter dynamics and soil texture were studied to discuss the particular spatial pattern of tiger bush in Niger and its dynamics. The soil texture through silt and clay contents showed a high variability in the vegetation arc as well as in the bare area. These variations were clearly linked to water/wind erosion and termite activity. Tiger bush soils showed a high capacity to store soil organic matter despite a moderate primary production, even in the bare area where the input of plant debris has been nil for many decades. The carbon content was higher within the vegetation are (0.93 %) than within the bare area (0.45 %). Additionally, potential carbon mineralisation significantly varied in relation to the total carbon content and thus to primary production. Then, the vegetation arcs can be viewed as 'fertility islands' as in many arid ecosystems. The measurements of δ13C showed a dominant contribution of C3 plants to the soil organic matter pool. Nevertheless, the contribution of C4 plants was not negligible. Two hypotheses could be proposed: a different mineralisation rate between C3 and C4 plants; or (ii) a better physical protection of C4 compounds against biodegradation. The soil variables depending totally or partly on biological factors, such as carbon and nitrogen contents, carbon isotopic composition, carbon potential mineralisation, did not show any symmetry in their variations along the studied transects. It was expected in the vegetation arc because the vegetation cover does not show symmetry in its specific composition and spatial structure. In the bare area, a clear asymmetry was observed on some of the variables: carbon content, fine material content and natural abundance of 13C. This supports the hypothesis that the vegetation arcs move upslope, and weakens the hypothesis of the alternance of contraction and spreading periods of the vegetation cover.},

abstract={Continuous cropping or decreasing the frequency of summer fallow (F) in cereal-based dryland rotations may have benefits other than greater water utilization and erosion control. We hypothesized that rotations with no fallow or minimum fallow frequency can produce more biomass and cover than the traditional winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer fallow systems (W-F), and ultimately, greater amounts of soil organic matter (SOM). To this end, we evaluated changes in various pools of SOM at the 0- to 5- and 0- to 15-cm depths on a Weld loam (fine, smectitic, mesic aridic Paleustolls) that were caused by (i) decreasing fallow or increasing cropping intensities, (ii) specific rotations of the same length but with different crop sequencing, and (iii) accumulated residue and roots from reduced- or no-tillage from 1993 to 1997. Total soil organic carbon (SOC) and N for the 0- to 5-cm depth increased by ≃20% with continuous cropping rotations compared with W-F rotations. Particulate organic matter-carbon (POM-C) doubled, while POM-N, and soluble organic C (OC) increased by one third for the same comparison. At the 0- to 15-cm depth, SOC, POM-C, and POM-N did not differ among systems with fallow, nor among systems with cropping intensities greater than W-F. Thus, significant differences always existed between W-F and continuous cropping. Generally, fallow had a negative influence on SOC accumulation, and continuous cropping a positive influence on surface SOM. Changes in SOC did not correlate with yields in the five-year comparison of this ongoing study.

abstract={Soil erosion is a major threat for Ferralsols in Cameroon. The influence of traditional intercropping (TI), disk-harrow ploughing (DH), no-tillage (NT), and Wischmeier bare fallow (BF) on runoff coefficient, soil loss, organic carbon (OC) content and bulk density was evaluated in topsoils of a forest Ferralsol in Yaounde region, Central Cameroon, using erosion plots. This was to ensure the best conditions for the determination of the soil properties to be assessed. After two years of cropping, the mean runoff coefficient remained very low for TI (&lt;2% of the rain) as compared with NT (14%) and DH (15%). The same held true for soil loss which was in the order of 2, 68 and 109 Mg ha-1 for TI, NT, and DH respectively, and bulk density which was 1.06, 1.18 and 1.21 Mg m-3 respectively. Comparing the latter with the measurements obtained from BF (1.23 Mg m-3) and the adjacent secondary forest (SF) (1.04 Mg m-3) showed that the disk-harrow treatment was the most degraded among the three. The same comparison was made for the OC content. It was found that while in SF, OC was as high as 30 g kg-1 it was only 11, 13, 15 and 18 g kg-1 in BF, DH, TI, and NT respectively. On the average and for the time frame considered, TI adversely affected topsoil properties less than NT, DH and BF in this order. Based on the above, it can be concluded that TI is more conservative than the three other land management techniques investigated.},

Eight coffee tree populations were evaluated: 7143, 3571, 2381, 1786, 1429, 1190, 1020, and 893 trees/ha. Increasing plant population increased soil pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, extractable P, organic carbon, moisture content and coffee root colonization by vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and decreased exchangeable Al and microbial biomass. Such results were attributed to better erosion control, improved plant residue management and nutrient cycling, and decreased leaching losses. Increasing coffee tree population per unit of area has shown to be an important reclamation recuperation strategy for improving fertility of the acid soils in Paraná, Brazil.},

abstract={Atmospheric CO2 is consumed both by organic matter formation and chemical rock weathering, and subsequently discharged as dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and dissolved inorganic carbon to the oceans by rivers. In the long term, varying the ratio of the amount of atmospheric CO2 consumed by continental erosion and the amount of CO2 released during carbonate precipitation and organic matter respiration in the oceans can change the CO2 content in the atmosphere. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether riverine organic carbon fluxes during the last glacial maximum (LGM) may have been different from today in order to assess the potential impact on atmospheric CO2. Previous studies mainly focused on the role of the river fluxes of inorganic carbon in this respect, but none of them examined possible variations in the fluxes of organic carbon, although the erosion of organic carbon actually represents the bulk of the atmospheric CO2 consumption by continental erosion. We therefore applied a global carbon erosion model to a LGM scenario in order to determine the riverine fluxes of organic matter during that time. The climatic conditions during the LGM were reconstructed using a computer simulation with a general circulation model. It is found that during the LGM the riverine organic carbon input into the oceans was at least ~10% lower than today. Most of the reduction of the total organic matter fluxes is due to the reduction of the fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. The fluxes of particulate organic carbon remained almost unchanged. The oceanic response to the lower carbon input was estimated on the basis of a present-day steady state budget for organic river carbon in the oceans, and implies that the reduction of the river fluxes were more than counterbalanced by lower burial rates due to the smaller shelf area during the LGM. This suggests that both the lower river carbon input and the relatively greater share of this carbon being subjected to oceanic respiration, acted as a negative feedback to the low atmospheric CO2 content during the LGM.},

abstract={The Permian-Triassic boundary in the Sydney Basin of Australia is coincident with a pronounced decrease in δ13C isotopic values of organic carbon, the last coals anywhere in the world for all of the Early Triassic (ca. 6 m.y.) time, and extirpation of the Glossopteris flora at the top of the Illawarra and Newcastle Coal Measures. Coal-bearing paleosols of the latest Permian represent extensive swamplands of the seasonally deciduous Glossopteris flora in a humid cold temperate lowland southwest of an Andean-style volcanic arc. Stone-rolls (large ribs of floor rock up into the coal) within some of the uppermost coals of the Permian coal measures can be interpreted as string bogs of a kind now found in cold climates at latitudes of 68°-70°, which is compatible with a paleomagnetically estimated paleolatitude of 65°-85°S for the Sydney Basin. Paleolatitude was not much different for earliest Triassic time, but paleosols of that age include Inceptisols and Entisols showing substantial chemical and textural weathering, more like soils now forming at latitudes of 40°-58°than those within polar circles. This anomalous high-latitude warmth set in at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Sedimentation rates increased at the boundary marked by geochemically unusual acidification of clay and a dramatic carbon isotopic excursion. These changes in environments and ecosystems can be explained by soil erosion following deforestation implied by the plant extinctions and abundant fungal remains at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Evidence from paleosols can now be added to that from paleontological and isotopic studies showing that disruption of the carbon cycle at the Permian-Triassic boundary resulted in a CO2 or CH4 post-apocalyptic greenhouse paleoclimate.},

abstract={Matter fluxes result from chemical and mechanical weathering that vary as a function of climate, relief, lithology and human activities. The aim of this paper is to characterize chemical weathering variations in the past using coaly particles found in both the geological substratum and the Holocene lacustrine sediments of a calcareous basin (Chaillexon lake, Doubs, France). Results point out that chemical weathering was the predominant erosional process in the watershed, which may be due to the calcareous nature of the bedrock. The significant variability of this process relative to mechanical weathering during the Holocene period can be interpreted as a consequence of the development of the vegetal cover induced by climate changes and human activity (forest clearing and landuse). Results also suggest that there is no direct relationship between chemical weathering in the watershed and autochthonous carbonate precipitation in the lake.},

abstract={Soil temperature affects crop growth through its impact on nutrient and water availability, yet few studies have quantitatively analyzed the effects of erosion on soil temperature regime. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the impact of soil erosion on diurnal temperature fluctuations, and develop a simple model for predicting soil temperature regime from soil properties. Measurements of soil properties were made on four erosion classes established on Rhodic Ferrasol on the basis of the thickness of Ap horizon under natural field conditions. Fourier series analysis and boundary conditions obtained from observed temperature data were used to develop the model for predicting soil temperature. Results obtained indicate that soil erosion exposes subsoil, reduces soil organic carbon and moisture content. For dry soil condition, the heat capacity was 0.26 cal/cm3°C for severely eroded and 0.23 cal/cm3°C for slightly eroded class. The maximum soil temperature was about 1°C lower at 5 cm depth and 0.5°C at 30 cm depth for least compared with severely eroded phase. At field capacity, volumetric heat capacity was 0.53 cal/cm3°C for severely eroded and 0.57 cal/cm3°C for least eroded phase. Fourier series analysis can be used to predict soil temperature under different soil conditions by applying an appropriate boundary condition.},

abstract={The organic carbon database for the soils of Siberia has been developed. It includes data on humus content and bulk density determined in 5850 and 2300 soil pits, respectively. On the basis of these data we calculated the reserve of organic carbon in Siberian soils. It constitutes 199 × 109 t, or 13.1% of the total world pool. During the last century, the total loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils in Western Siberia amounted to 11.2 × 108 t, or 29% of the initial content. The losses induced by erosion and deflation reached 1.1 × 108 t, or 10% of the total loss. With the passage of time, the loss induced by mineralization decreases, whereas the soil erosion loss increases. Bog ecosystems of Western Siberia serve as sinks for carbon dioxide owing to the active accumulation of peat. Within the past century, the amount of carbon sequestered in peat deposits of Western Siberia has reached approximately 15 × 108 t, i.e., it is 1.5 times higher than the loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils within the same period.},

abstract={Maintaining environmental quality implies sustainable agricultural production systems that preserve and protect soil resources. Cover crops play a dual role maintaining resource quality by providing ground cover to prevent wind and water erosion and carbon input to enhance soil quality. Carbon input from cover crops and crop stover play a vital role in agroecosystems for insuring long-term economic benefits with minimal impact on soil, water and air quality. The fresh carbon from cover crops is critical because of the role of the soil organic carbon cycle in controlling water, temperature, aeration, and soil structure. Both aboveground and root biomass are important to chemical and biological properties for the role in nutrient cycling. The benefits of available nitrogen from symbiotic fixation makes legume cover crops an environmental and economic preference. Use of selected cover crops and associated allelopathic effects can reduce chemicals required for weed control. While there are positive and negative aspects of cover crops from the economic viewpoint, when environmental costs are properly credited, cover crops surface as a major contribution to soil and environmental quality. The challenge is to assure cost-effective production using cover crops to maintain a healthy environment, a healthy economy, and a high quality of life.},

abstract={Revegetation and restoration of degraded wildland ecosystems depends upon an adequate, long-term supply of nitrogen from a variety of nitrogen pools. Site disturbance often reduces or removes the soil organic matter, soil microbes and plant litter that are the sources of these nitrogen pools. This is especially true in the thin, nutrient poor, relatively young high elevation soils of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This paper describes an ongoing study intended to characterize several aspects of this nitrogen supply. These aspects include: (1) the amount of nitrogen in various pools that support plant growth for extended periods of time (and delineates sustainable from non-sustainable), (2) the seasonal release rate or turnover of nitrogen required for a healthy, dynamic plant community, (3) the soil sampling depth required to adequately characterize the condition of a disturbed site and (4) the estimated nitrogen release rate of various fertilizers, organic soil amendments including composts and mulches that might be used to 'bootstrap' disturbed soil ecosystem to approximate predisturbance conditions. In 1995, we sampled 21 sites throughout the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each site usually consisted of paired, well-vegetated and poorly vegetated areas. Total carbon and nitrogen, mineralized nitrogen (an index of seasonal availability) and available nitrate and ammonium were evaluated and compared. In 1996, we conducted a much more intensive survey on two Sierra Nevada soils (volcanic and granitic) over a range of vegetation cover classes. We have identified threshold amounts of total and mineralizable nitrogen that are significantly different between well-vegetated and poorly vegetated sites. Our results indicate that anaerobically mineralized nitrogen is correlated with plant cover on two Tahoe Basin soils. We suggest that a 1-10 cm depth is optimum for screening site fertility. The data indicate that, in wildland systems, extractable nitrate and ammonium are not reliable indicators of plant cover. The ongoing fertilizer/amendment component of this study uses laboratory soil leaching columns to compare N release rates and microbial respiration various materials in order to determine the suitability of those materials as long-term sources of nitrogen to disturbed sites.},

abstract={Enrichment ratios (ER) are widely used to predict loss of sorbed nutrients or pesticides with runoff sediment, while ER is frequently neglected in studies which quantify past erosion from global fallout 137Cs losses. The ER of 137Cs (ER- 137Cs) in the soil loss and the subsequent depletion of 137Cs at the soil surface were determined for eight small watersheds (1.6-16.8 ha) with different soils and land use. Due to preferential loss of the clay fraction, the upper 5 mm of the soil surface was significantly depleted of 137Cs after a heavy storm. A total of 31 watershed-events were investigated with soil losses ranging between 1.2 and 480 kg-ha -1 and sediment concentrations between 1.98 and 54.1 g-L -1. The correspondent ER- 137Cs (mean: 1.72, range: 0.40-4.95) was positively correlated to the ER of clay, organic carbon, total nitrogen and calcium-acetate-lactate-extractable phosphorus (P CAL). A close correlation between ER- 137Cs and ER-P CAL was also found for sediment samples of detention ponds, where most of the ER values were less than 1.0 due to depletion. Therefore, ER-PCAL seems to be a suitable estimate of ER- 137Cs for both, erosion and deposition processes. Our findings strongly support the need for considering ER- 137Cs, when 137Cs data are used to assess rates and pattern of soil redistribution. Otherwise, soil loss will be overestimated in a range of about factor 2 in many cases. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1998.},

abstract={In areas surrounding the Matengo highlands, a ridge (Matuta) system of tillage is practised in conjunction with the more traditional Ngoro pit system. As in the Ngoro system, all vegetation prior to hand tillage is slashed and the residues are roughly aligned across the hillside, with soil thrown down the slope to form a ridge over the organic residues (ridge+OM), if labour is limiting the organic residues are burnt prior to ridge construction (ridge-OM). Both systems are said by the respective exponents to conserve moisture in soil, reduce soil erosion and where organic residues are incorporated improve soil fertility. A survey of 20 fields with Ngoro and 25 fields with Matuta on slopes ranging between 2 and 50% suggests that erosion occurred on less than 25% Ngoro fields, compared to 72% of fields under the Matuta ridges. On the Ngoro fields sheet erosion was dominant, with only one field having a gully. However, in all five fields, the erosion process was caused by water moving into the site from uncultivated fields above. This was in contrast to fields with the Matuta ridge system, where gullying was the dominant form of erosion. In fact erosion only failed to occur on those ridges aligned on the contour or combined with live barriers. In the Ngoro system, the majority of soil was redeposited in the pits, meaning a small, if any, nett loss of soil, but in the ridge systems much of the soil was transported out of the study areas. On a seasonal basis no statistical differences were observed in the amount of water stored under Ngoro, ridge+OM or ridges-OM or crop yields over three fields with slopes of 14%, 38% and 45%. Nevertheless, over three seasons of observation the Ngoro consistently yielded more beans and maize than either of the ridged systems, which produced similar quantities of beans. Maize yields on the ridges+OM was higher than ridges-OM. Although the monitoring period was not long enough to detect any major differences in soil chemistry, levels of organic Carbon were slightly higher under the ridge+OM than the other two systems, although this was not statistically significant. Economic analysis has indicated that Ngoro provides highest productivity where fertiliser is not applied, though at low soil fertility levels all systems are likely to give negative gross margins. Where fertiliser is applied the Matuta ridge systems are likely to give higher returns. Future work must be concentrated on the introduction of field boundary management techniques that prevent water shed from land above entering fields and creating erosion problems. Alignment of tillage systems, particularly the ridges along the contour and introduce some form of physical or a biological barrier than can reduce slope lengths. Lastly, but more importantly the farmers must be empowered to understand the economic value of fertilisers and organic residues and be encouraged not to burn it.},

abstract={This study was conducted at three-year-old and seven-year-old sites which were afforested and had varying surface structures, i.e. crests and troughs. The average difference in elevation between crest and trough was 80 cm, between crests the average distance was 150 cm. Erosion of the bare soil led to an accumulation of silt and clay particles within the troughs. As a consequence, physical and chemical properties of the soil such as actual water content and the content of the exchangable macronutrients PO 4 3-P, K +, Ca 2+ varied between crests and troughs within three-year-old sites (always p &lt; 0.05). In addition, we found a higher carbon (C(org)) and NO 3(-)-N content of the soil in the troughs than in the crests (always p &lt; 0.01). Dry weight of the leaf litter, water retention capacity and the NH 4(+)-N content were significantly different (always p &lt; 0.01) between the crests and the troughs of the seven-year-old sites. Microbial respiration and biomass increased during the course of the succession for both types of surface formations (always p &lt; 0.001). Microbial biomass of the troughs was 1.5 times higher than the crests at the three-year-old sites and 3.0 times higher at the seven-year-old sites. Enchytraeidae, Collembola and Chironomidae were most common at three-year-old sites. Significantly higher densities (p &lt; 0.01) in the troughs were only observed for Collembola. Individuals of several families of Diptera such as Bibionidae, Tipulidae, Sciaridae and Faniidae were most common at the seven-year-old sites, whereby the densities of all families were significantly higher in the troughs than in the crests (always p &lt; 0.05). There was a correlation between the soil organic carbon content (C(org)), the biomass of the Tipulidae (r(s) = 0.743, p &lt; 0.001, n = 16) and the biomass of the microorganisms (r(s) = 0.793, p &lt; 0.001, n = 20) as well. Moreover, we found a correlation between microbial biomass and macronutrients (NO 3(-)-N, r(s) = 0.789, p &lt; 0.001; NH 4(+)-N, r(s) = 0.490, p &lt; 0.05), and the actual water content was correlated with the biomass of Tipulidae (r(s) = 0.551, p &lt; 0.05) and the biomass of microorganisms (r(s) = 0.493, p &lt; 0.05).},

abstract={A rapid increase in population is causing severe strain on natural resources and environment of East Africa. Per capita arable land area is declined in several densely populated regions of East Africa. Two major issues in soil and environmental degradation, i.e., greenhouse effect and water quality are described. Three principal soil degradation processes with reference to productivity are physical, chemical and biological degradation. Soil physical degradation can affect crop growth and yield by decreasing root depth and available water and nutrient reserves and soil erosion can lead to yield loss by affecting soil organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents and soil pH. Reduction in maize grain yield on moderately and severely eroded soils compared with uneroded soils in Tanzania was 14 to 39%. Chemical degradation is caused by the processes of nutrient depletion and/or loss of organic matter, acidification and toxic aluminum, salinization, and industrial and mining activities. In Tanzania, a modest cropping system of maize and bean removed about 58,13, and 56 kg ha−1 of N, P, and K, respectively. The average use of fertilizers in this cropping system was only 22.5 kg ha−1 and thus resulting in “nutrient mining.” Principal issues of agricultural sustainability are discussed. © 1998 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In an oxisol-spodosol system developed on the terrestrial surface of the lower Tapajos Valley, the determination of total mercury (Hg), organic carbon (C), iron and aluminum oxy-hydroxide (Fe(cdb) and Al(cdb)) concentrations in the surface soil horizons are used to characterise the geochemical processes controlling the accumulation of Hg in soils under natural vegetation cover and in deforested and cultivated sites. Oxisols from the plateau have homogeneous and relatively high background Hg contents and burdens constituting an important natural reservoir of Hg for the region (90-210 ng/g dry wt. and 19-33 mg/m2 for the first 20 cm). The Fe(cdb) and Al(cdb) contents associated with the fine fraction (&lt;63 μm) of the soil suggest that oxy-hydroxides and, particularly Al-substituted Fe oxy-hydroxides, control the Hg concentrations observed in all of the soils of the study region. Consequently, the geochemistry of these minerals along the slopes governs the accumulation or the release of the Hg according to the natural evolution of the soil cover and/or following the degradation of soils by erosion after deforestation and cultivation. These observations have important implications for the interpretation of Hg contamination patterns observed in Amazonian aquatic systems that could be linked to different drainage sources of Hg from the terrestrial surface. The sandification and podzolisation that is characteristic of the evolution of numerous pedological systems in the equatorial Amazon could be responsible for exportation of the naturally accumulated Hg, as for other metals, by acidic complexation and migration to the black waters of the Amazon. In the central Amazon region, as a result of the fragility of the soil cover, deforestation and cultivation, affecting principally the superficial soil, promote the selective erosion of fine particles enriched in oxides and Hg. The erosion of soil could be responsible for an important release of Hg, transported in particulate form by drainage waters. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Large quantities of sediments leave the Himalaya through its rivers. These rivers are charged with sediments depending on the types of land use in the watersheds. Land use/cover change and hydrology was studied in a watershed in the Sikkim Himalaya. The land use change from forest and agroforestry to open agriculture has increased by 11% from 1988 to 1992. During the same period substantial areas of dense mixed forests have been converted to open mixed and degraded forests as a result of high pressure on natural resources. Stream flow was highest in the rainy season and lowest in summer season in all the streams and all the three years (1994-1997) of the study. The water quality of streams from different microwatersheds varied significantly between seasons and streams. Sediment and nutrient loss was estimated in microwatersheds and soil loss from the total watershed ranged from 4.18 to 8.82 t ha -1 yr -1 during the three-year period of study. The annual total nitrogen loss estimated at the watershed outlet was at a rate of 33 kg ha -1, organic carbon 267 kg ha -1 and total phosphorus 5 kg ha -1. This study suggests that the upland microwatersheds can be hydroecologically sustainable only if good forest cover and dense forests with large cardamom-based agroforestry are maintained.},

abstract={Increasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils in Canada is examined as a possible strategy in slowing or stopping the current increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Estimates are provided on the amount of carbon that could be sequestered in soils in various regions in Canada by reducing summerfallow area, increased use of forage crops, improved erosion control, shifts from conventional to minimal and no-till, and more intensive use of fertilizers. The reduction of summerfallow by more intensive agriculture would increase the continuous cropland base by 8.1% in western Canada and 6.8% in all of Canada. Although increased organic carbon (OC) sequestration could be achieved in all agricultural regions, the greatest potential gains are in areas of Chernozemic soils. The best management options include reduction of summerfallow, conversion of fallow areas to hay or continuous cereals, fertilization to ensure nutrient balance, and adoption of soil conservation measures. The adoption of these options could sequester about 50-75% of the total agricultural emissions of CO2 in Canada for the next 30 years. However, increased sequestration of atmospheric carbon in the soil is possible for only a limited time. Increased efforts must be made to reduce emissions if long-term mitigation is to be achieved.},

abstract={Within the framework of the IDAF (IGAC DEBITS AFRICA) network, we present in this paper data on precipitation and aerosol chemistry in the semiarid savanna of the Sahelian region of Niger. An automatic wet-only precipitation collector was operated at the Banizoumbou station during the entire 1996 rainy season (June to September 1996). Inorganic (Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-) and organic contents of the precipitation (HCOOH, CH3COOH, C2H5COOH) were determined by Ion Chromatography (IC) in 29 rainfall events. Once per week, bulk particle samples were collected on the same site, and soluble water material was determined by IC. We examined the influence of atmospheric gas and particle sources on the precipitation and aerosol chemical contents. We established the influence of marine, terrigenous, and biogenic sources in the Sahelian region. The tenigenous signature is dominant and related to Sahelian soil erosion, with a high calcium content in precipitation (31.2 μeq L-1) and in aerosols (1.8 μg m-3). Two other signatures of atmospheric sources are highlighted by the relatively high nitrogenous (ammonium and nitrate) and organic contents (formate, acetate) in the precipitation. Ammonium (12.9 μeq L-1) and nitrate (12.3 μeq L-1) contents confirm respectively the biogenic source of ammonia released by domestic animal excreta in Niger and the natural emissions from semiarid savannas soils, perturbed by wild or domestic animal grazing. In spite of a high potential acidity given by nitrate, formate and acetate; a weak acidity (H+ (2.1 μeq L-1) is calculated from the mean pH of 5.67 measured. A statistical analysis of the aerosol chemical composition clearly indicates that nitrates are strongly correlated at the 1% level with terrigenous ions, i.e., Ca2+ and Mg2+ (0.95 &lt; r &lt; 1). We observed a similar relationship between all the terrigenous ions and nitrate in the precipitation. In the Sahelian region, alkaline soil dust representative of the terrigenous contribution interact, with gaseous nitrogenous and carbonaceous compounds, leading to the neutralization of acid gases and subsequent weak acidity in precipitation. Finally, taking into account the main chemical characteristics of Banizoumbou precipitations and aerosols, which demonstrate the importance of heterogeneous and multiphase chemical processes, we propose a conceptual model of the atmospheric chemistry in the Sahelian region.},

abstract={This study examines the effect of soil water content on aggregate stability and determines the relationships between the variation in soil stability and soil physical properties (texture, organic carbon, bulk density, pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity) in a microcatchment located in a semi-arid area of southeast Spain. The aggregate stability of soils was determined at three soil water contents (close to saturation, field capacity and air-dry) using a laboratory rainfall simulator technique. The aggregate stability for wetter conditions was higher than for the air-dry conditions for 85% of the samples tested. Furthermore, considerable difference in air-dry aggregate stability values was observed for predominant erosional and depositional zones within the microcatchment. This variability in air-dry aggregates stability was closely related to hydraulic properties and organic carbon content of the soil. Test on aggregate stability of air-dried soils are particularly appropriate for soils from semi-arid environments, and provide a more sensitive indicator of differences in the soil stability within the microcatchment than wetter samples.},

abstract={Alteration of paleosols following development and burial is common. Chemical, physical and mechanical processes can weld younger to older soil profiles and affect the accumulation, dissolution, and reprecipitation of material in soils. Soil properties most affected include texture and porosity, and, the content and distribution of soluble salts, amorphous silica, gypsum, carbonate, and clay. Organic matter retention is highly dependent on post-burial biologically controlled oxidation reduction and pH conditions. Processes such as erosion and deposition can truncate profiles or bury them either rapidly or extremely slowly. Effects of these and other processes on soil properties must be examined with care in paleosols that have been buried even for a short interval. This study presents several examples of soil properties which should be evaluated carefully and possibly avoided as indicators in paleoenvironmental reconstruction, paleosol classification, and regional stratigraphic correlation.},

abstract={The study aimed at quantifying the effects of erosion on the productivity of a Nigerian soil involved the use of a half hectare farmland with history of various degrees of erosion severity. The farmland was divided into 3 different classes; class I (uneroded), class II (slightly eroded) and class III (moderately eroded) based on the degree of erosion severity and were then planted with maize. The mean topsoil's (0-15 cm) colour hue reduced from 7.5YR on class I to 5YR on class III soils (representing colour change from dark brown to dark reddish brown) on Munsell's colour chart. The soil properties and the maize yield on the farmland exhibited strong spatial variability, the trend of which appears to have been influenced by the topography of the area. The mean yield on the class II plots and the class III plots were 80% and 65% respectively of that in class I plots. Because of the strong functional dependencies identified among many of the variables, multivariate statistical procedure was used to identify the variables that influence maize yield. Seven components were selected based on factor analysis. These components when regressed against maize yield, were found to explain 95% of the variability in maize yield. The yield of maize on this soil was found to be determined by soil properties such as; bulk density, organic carbon, topsoil thickness, texture, pH and gravel content in the topsoil, and by base saturation, organic carbon and exchangeable acidity in the subsoil.},

abstract={Physical and chemical soil properties were measured along a mountainous climatological gradient in the province of Alicante (Spain). The objective was to evaluate how the climate affects certain soil properties at different temporal and spatial scales. These properties include infiltration, runoff and sediment concentrations resulting from rainfall simulation experiments performed in winter and in summer. Chemical soil properties like carbonate content, organic matter content and CEC were analysed in reference soil profiles along the gradient. Physical soil properties like soil moisture content, macroaggregation and waterstable microaggregation were measured at monthly intervals during a year. The comparison of the results was done at different spatial (site, slope and patch) and temporal (monthly and seasonal) scales by means of some statistical tests. It can be concluded that there are some soil properties positively related to the gradient, like organic matter, clay content and CEC which increase with the annual rainfall. However, runoff coefficients and erosion are higher when the climatic annual rainfall. However, runoff coefficients and erosion are higher when the climatic conditions become more arid. Aggregation and infiltration capacity are higher on north-facing slopes and in vegetated patches than in south-facing slopes and in bare patches.},

abstract={Because of concerns about the eventual impact of atmospheric CO2 accumulations, there is growing interest in reducing net CO2 emissions from soil and increasing C storage in soil. This review presents a framework to assess soil erosion and deposition processes on the distribution and loss of C in soils. The physical processes of erosion and deposition affect soil C distribution in two main ways and should be considered when evaluating the impact of agriculture on C storage. First, these processes redistribute considerable amounts of soil C, within a toposequence or a field, or to a distant site. Accurate estimates of soil redistribution in the landscape or field are needed to quantify the relative magnitude of soil lost by erosion and accumulated by deposition. Secondly, erosion and deposition drastically alter the biological process of C mineralization in soil landscapes. Whereas erosion and deposition only redistribute soil and organic C, mineralization results in a net loss of C from the soil system to the atmosphere. Little is known about the magnitude of organic C losses by mineralization and those due to erosion, but the limited data available suggest that mineralization predominates in the first years after the initial cultivation of the soil, and that erosion becomes a major factor in later years. Soils in depositional sites usually contain a larger proportion of the total organic C in labile fractions of soil C because this material can be easily transported. If the accumulation of soil in depositional areas is extensive, the net result of the burial (and subsequent reduction in decomposition) of this active soil organic matter would be increased C storage. Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. At regional or global levels its greatest impact on C storage may be in affecting soil productivity. Erosion usually results in decreased primary productivity, which in turn adversely affects C storage in soil because of the reduced quantity of organic C returned to the soil as plant residues. Thus the use of management practices that prevent or reduce soil erosion may be the best strategy to maintain, or possibly increase, the worlds soil C storage.},

abstract={The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was initiated to reduce water and wind erosion on marginal, highly erodible croplands by removing them from production and planting permanent, soil-conserving vegetation such as grass. We conducted a field study at two sites in Wyoming, USA, in order to quantify changes in soil C and N of marginal croplands seeded to grass, and of native rangeland plowed and cropped to wheat-fallow. Field plots were established on a sandy loam site and a clay loam site on wheat-fallow cropland that had been in production for 60+ years and on adjacent native rangeland. In 1993, 6 years after the study was initiated, the surface soft was sampled in 2.5 cm depth increments, while the subsurface soil was composited as one depth increment. All soil samples were analyzed for total organic C and N, and potential net mineralized C and N. After 60+ years of cultivation, surface soils at both study sites were 18-26% lower (by mass) in total organic C and N than in the A horizons of adjacent native range. Six years after plowing and converting native rangeland to cropland (three wheat-fallow cycles), both total and potential net mineralized C and N in the surface soil had decreased and NO3-N at all depths had increased to levels found after 60+ years of cultivation. We estimate that mixing of the surface and subsurface soil with tillage accounted for 40-60% of the decrease in surface soil C and N in long-term cultivated fields; in the short-term cultivated fields, mixing with tillage may have accounted for 60-75% of the decrease in C, and 30-60% of the decrease in N. These results emphasize the need to evaluate C and N in the entire soil solum, rather than in just the surface soil, if actual losses of C and N due to cultivation are to be distinguished from vertical redistribution. Five years after reestablishing grass on the sandy loam soil, both total and potential net mineralized C and N in the surface soil had increased to levels equal to or greater than those observed in the A horizon of the native range. On the clay loam soil, however, significant increases in total organic C were observed only in the surface 2.5 cm of N-fertilized grass plots, while total organic N had not significantly increased from levels observed in the long-term cultivated fields.},

abstract={Soils in semi-arid regions are highly susceptible to soil organic matter (SOM) loss when cultivated because of erratic yield, removal of crop residue for feed or fuel, uncontrolled soil erosion, and frequent fallowing to increase water storage. It is important to quantify the effect of each factor to be able to identify agoecosystems that are sustainable and recognize the management practices that best sequester C in soil. We identified changes in SOM in long-term experiments, some dating from the early 1900s, by evaluating tillage and crop rotation effects at several locations in semi-arid regions of the US Pacific Northwest. The major factors influencing changes in organic C and N were the frequency of summer-fallow and the amount of c input by crop residue. Soil erosion was low in long-term studies, but even limited soil loss can have a substantial impact on C and N levels if allowed over many years. Yearly crop production is recommended because any cropping system that included summer-fallow lost SOM over time without large applications of manure. We conclude that most of the SOM loss was due to high biological oxidation and absence of C input during the fallow year rather than resulting from erosion. Decreasing tillage intensity reduced SOM loss, but the effect was not as dramatic as eliminating summer-fallow. Crop management practices such as N fertilization increased residue production and improved C and N levels in soil. SOM can be maintained or increased in most semi-arid soils if they are cropped every year, crop residues are returned to soil, and erosion is kept to a minimum. SOM loss may be more intense in the Pacific Northwest because fallowing keeps the soil moist during the summer months when it would normally be dry. Our experiments identify two primary deficiencies of long-term studies to measure C sequestering capability: (1) soil C loss can be partitioned between erosion and biological oxidation only by estimation, and (2) C changes occurring below 30 cm in grassland soils cannot be quantified in many instances because samples were not collected.},

abstract={Poor aggregate stability and high erodibility of soils found in Mediterranean climates are often due to low organic matter content. The low organic matter content is sometimes compensated for by iron oxides that stabilize soil structure. Low water stability of aggregates often determines the propensity for soils to form surface crusts and seals (wet crusts). Seals reduce soil infiltration rate and may increase erosion by increasing runoff. We conducted rainfall simulation experiments on 30 cm × 30 cm plots inclined at 9% slope in which we measured soil splash and wash erosion, runoff and splash volume for 17 California soils. The soils ranged in clay content from 8 to 36%, ESP from < 1 to 56%, and organic carbon from 0.4 to 7.0%. Infiltration rate was used as a measure of seal formation. Soils that had 3.1 to 7.0% organic carbon and 2.4 to 10.7% CBD extractable iron plus aluminum did not form seals, infiltration rate remained high throughout the rainfall run, and neither runoff nor erosion occurred. Soils with < 20% clay, < 3% organic carbon, and < 2.0% CBD extractable Fe + Al readily formed seals that reduce infiltration rate and total volume of water infiltrated and increased the volume of runoff water and mass of soil eroded. Initial soil water content was also important in determining crustal and subsequently the volume of runoff and amount of erosion. These data show that the formation of soil seals increases runoff and erosion through the early stages of seal development and that organic matter and iron oxides are critically important factors in determining soil surface stability and erodobility.},

abstract={A better understanding of the soil aggregation process is needed to address a variety of concerns, including soil quality and erosion, agricultural sustainability, soil C sequestration, the mobility of hazardous chemicals and remediation of contaminated sites. We used data from a chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restorations and a path analysis approach to evaluate how the lengths of two dia size classes of fibrous roots, the length of external mycorrhizal hyphae, microbial biomass C, hot-water soluble carbohydrate C and soil organic C interact to promote the stabilization of soil aggregates. The measured binding agents accounted for 88% of the variation in macroaggregates >212 μm diameter and goodness-of-fit indexes indicated a good practical fit of the path model to the data. The restoration of macroaggregate structure in this system was apparently driven by the direct and indirect effects of roots and external hyphae, with lesser relative contributions by the three measured C pools. Although the two root size classes had similar direct effects on the percentage of macroaggregates, their indirect contributions differed substantially. Fine roots (0.2-1 mm diameter) exerted considerable indirect effects via their strong influences on external hyphae and microbial biomass C. Very fine roots (< 0.2 mm dia) made a stronger contribution to soil organic C than fine roots, but their overall indirect contribution to aggregation was minimal. In addition, the relative importance of each binding agent varied for different size fractions of macroaggregates and generally supported the hypothesis that the effectiveness of various binding mechanisms depends on the physical dimensions of the binding agents relative to the spatial scales of the aggregate planes of weakness being bridged.},

abstract={Knowledge of seasonal variation in soil structural and related properties is important for the determination of critical periods during which soil is susceptible to accelerated erosion and other degradative processes. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the magnitude of seasonal variations in selected soil and deposited sediment properties in relation to soil erodibility for a Miamian silt-loam soil (Typic Hapludalf) in central Ohio. Erosion plots (USLE-type) were established on a 4.5% slope and maintained under bare, ploughed conditions from 1988 to 1991. Particle size distribution, bulk density ρb), percentage water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon(SOC), and total soil nitrogen (TSN) of both soil and sediment samples were monitored between Autumn 1989 and Spring 1991. The soil and sediment particle size distributions followed no clear seasonal trends. Soil ρb increased following tillage (1.20 Mg m-3) and was highest (1.45 Mg m-3) during the autumn owing to soil slumping and consolidation upon drying. Low winter and spring values of ρb and %WSA (20-50% lower than in autumn) were attributed to excessive wetness and freeze-thaw effects. Both SOC and soil TSN contents progressively declined (from 2.18 to 1.79% and 1.97 to 1.75 g kg-1, respectively) after ploughing owing to maintenance of plots under bare, fallow conditions. Spring highs and autumn lows of sediment (SOC (3.12 vs. 2.44%) and TSN (2.70 vs. 1.96 g kg-1) contents were a result of the combined effects of soil microbial activity and rainfall erosivity. Soil properties such as bulk density, SOC and WSA, which vary seasonally, can potentially serve as predictors of seasonal soil erodibility, which, in turn, could improve the predictive capacity of soil erosion prediction models.

abstract={Despite a relatively high organic matter content, the heavy soils of the St-Lawrence lowlands of eastern Canada are susceptible to structural degradation in the form of compaction, surface crusting and sheet erosion. The resistance of these soil to degradation is largely controlled by the presence of stable macroaggregates. Several agronomic studies involving various combinations of management options such as organic additions, crop rotations and reduced tillage have allowed to intensively monitor the changes in aggregation of these soils through time. The proportion of water-stable macroaggregates (>1 am) showed large temporal variation. Short-range variations (days or weeks) were attributable to climatic conditions and tillage operations as revealed by significant correlations between soil water content and aggregation within a growing season. Longer-term trends (>2 years) were a function mostly of carbon (C) management i.e. placement or location of the residues in the soil profile, and the amount and quality of the residues. The effect of C management was reflected by correlations between aggregation, C inputs, soil C content and organic matter (OM) fractions. Based on a study of the OM associated with the primary particles it is proposed that the clay and silt particles of these soils are relatively saturated in OM which leads to highly stable microaggregation. Any additional OM accumulation in the surface soil provided by reduced- or no-till conditions, perennial forage crops or manure additions would lead to increased macroaggregation and be related to the accumulation of particulate OM. This hypothesis helps to explain the relatively high responsiveness of soil structure, and in particular stable macroaggregation, to changes in cropping systems in these soils.},

abstract={This paper presents field and column experiments to determine the fate of radionuclides (238U, 226Ra and 210Pb) and Mn, when applied in uranium mine waste water sprayed on to highly weathered soils near the Ranger uranium mine at Jabiru, Northern Territory, Australia. The radionuclides were retained in the surface few centimetres of soil. 238U and 210Pb did not remain in exchangeable forms after reaction with the soil, and there is little likelihood of them moving with water. 226Ra was also retained in the surface of the soils and did not move, but it contrasted with the other radionuclides in that &gt; 14% of the total was in the exchangeable form which may be available for uptake by roots. The field experiment with 22Na and 54Mn tracers showed that Na was readily leached out of the soil by wet season rains and 54Mn was slightly more mobile than the radionuclides. In the soil column experiment 54Mn was transported rapidly and this was related to saturation of sorption sites by very high loading rates. For the surface (0-4 cm) horizon, which had more organic carbon than subsurface horizons, transport was promoted by reduction caused by saturation of the soil. Although more mobile than the radionuclides, Mn is unlikely to reach the groundwater if applied to the soils tested under field conditions. The radionuclides will remain at the surface of the soil, and although this is advantageous in preventing their accessions to groundwater, it has the disadvantage that the radionuclides are exposed to mobilisation with soil subject to wind and water erosion, to uptake by plants and to ingestion by foraging animals.},

abstract={This paper discusses the agricultural system in the Charazani region in the Bolivian Eastern Cordillera. The zone from 2800 m to 4300 m asl is intensively used by Indian people and a small Mestizo group. Their traditional agriculture reflects both Indian and Spanish (16th century) traditions. Such traditional systems have been subject to rather contrary myths: some call them primitive, others ecologically adapted. Studying key variables of soil fertility (concentrations and contents (pools) of organic carbon and utilizable water storage capacities) we will investigate the degree of ecological adaptation of the soil-use system in the Charazani region. These parameters, studied in 110 field sequences covering 0-30 cm soil depth, are discussed according to their absolute levels, differences between semi-natural and agriculturally used areas, and (only for organic carbon contents) actual changes during continuous management. The results show that land-use on the dry, wind-exposed and not irrigated sites is often insufficiently ecologically adapted. Here, intensive crop farming and sheep pasture without protection against wind erosion result in low and even decreasing soil fertility. Good ecological adaptation according to the investigated parameters is to be found, by contrast, on the more humid and better wind-protected sites as well as on the irrigated areas.},

abstract={This paper examines the linkages between the carbon cycle and sedimentary processes on land. Available data suggest that sedimentation on land can bury vast quantities of organic carbon, roughly 1015 g C yr-1. To evaluate the relative roles of various classes of processes in the burial of carbon on land, terrestrial sedimentation was modeled as a series of 864 scenarios. Each scenario represents a unique choice of intensities for seven classes of processes and two different global wetland distributions. Comparison was made with presumed preagricultural conditions. The classes of processes were divided into two major component parts: clastic sedimentation of soil-derived carbon and organic sedimentation of autochthonous carbon. For clastic sedimentation, masses of sediment were considered for burial as reservoir sediment, lake sediment, and combined colluvium, alluvium, and aeolian deposits. When the ensemble of models is examined, the human-induced burial of 0.6-1.5·1015 g yr-1 of carbon on land is entirely plausible. This sink reaches its maximum strength between 30 and 50 N. Paddy lands stand out as a type of land use that warrants future study, but the many faces of rice agriculture limit generalization. In an extreme scenario, paddy lands alone could be made to bury about 1·1015 g C yr-1. Arguing that terrestrial sedimentation processes could be much of the sink for the so called "missing carbon" is reasonable. Such a hypothesis, however, requires major redesign of how the carbon cycle is modeled. Unlike ecosystem processes that are amenable to satellite monitoring and parallel modeling, many aspects of terrestrial sedimentation are hidden from space. © This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

abstract={The export of carbon from land to sea by rivers represents a major link in the global carbon cycle. For all principal carbon forms, the main factors that control the present-day fluxes at the global scale have been determined in order to establish global budgets and to predict regional fluxes. Dissolved organic carbon fluxes are mainly related to drainage intensity, basin slope, and the amount of carbon stored in soils. Particulate organic carbon fluxes are calculated as a function of sediment yields and of drainage intensity. The consumption of atmospheric/soil CO2 by chemical rock weathering depends mainly on the rock type and on the drainage intensity. Our empirical models yield a total of 0.721 Gt of carbon (Gt C) that is exported from the continents to the oceans each year. From this figure, 0.096 Gt C come from carbonate mineral dissolution and the remaining 0.625 Gt C stem from the atmosphere (F(CO2)). Of this atmospheric carbon, 33% is discharged as dissolved organic carbon, 30% as particulate organic carbon, and 37% as bicarbonate ions. Predicted inorganic carbon fluxes were further compared with observed fluxes for a set of 35 major world rivers, and possible additional climatic effects on the consumption of atmospheric CO:2 by rock weathering were investigated in these river basins. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the river carbon fluxes and the role of continental erosion in the global carbon cycle during the last glacial maximum.},

abstract={In order to study the land degradation problem in a watershed on Henwal river, erodibility indices under different land use practices as well as osil suspended sediment and nutrient losses from the watershed were assessed. watershed comprising of 547.23 ha of land of which 34.8% area is under forest, 3.0% under grazing and 62.3% under cultivated lands. Lands under capability classes of IIIs, IVse, Vse, VIes, VIIes and VIIIes with erosion(e), soil and root zone limitations (s) were identified. the results revealed that erodibility indices viz. clay: moisture equivalent ratio (CMER), clay ratio (CR), percolation ratio (PR), surface aggregation ratio (SAR) and water stable aggregate (WSA) were lowest while erosion and dispersion ratios (ER and DR) were highest in the cultivated and horticultural lands whereas the opposite trend was noticed in the forest and grazing lands indicating their sensitivity to degradation and being prone to erosion. Land degradation was also estimated in terms of sediment and nutrients load in river water. Sediment and concentration of nutrients were highly variable in different weeks and months depdneing on rainfall. Highest sediment load of 148 mg L-1 was recorded during 8th week (3rd week of July). pH of the water was slightly alkaline (7.4) with EC of 122 μs m-1. Total soluble salts (TSS) varied from 110 to 180 mg L-1 with an average of 135 mg L-1. The bicarbonate (HCO3 -) and carbonates (CO3 2-) constituted &gt; 50%, calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) &gt;25%, chlorides (Cl-) 10% and thesulphates (SO6 and 2-), nitrates (NO3 -), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) together only 15% of the total ion concentration in the runoff. The possible causes for land degradation were identified as (i) ineffective soil and water conservation measures, (ii) lack of maintenance of soil organic matter; (iii) unbalanced use of fertilizer, (ivk) selection of crops not suited to particular soil type and faulty crop rotation.},

abstract={The Rolling Pampa is the most important cropping region of Argentina, and its soils are subjected to degradation. No-tillage has been proposed to replace the use of the moldboard plow to reduce soil C losses. The effects of no-tillage and plow tillage with and without N fertilization (0 or 90 kg N ha-1) on C inputs and outputs of a Typic Argiudoll and on organic C level and density fractions were studied in a field experiment at the end of 15 yr under a corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Microbial biomass and the rate of organic C mineralization during laboratory incubations were also determined. Nitrogen fertilization had no significant influence on C emission in the field, soil organic matter level or microbial biomass and activity. The annual C budget was negative under both tillage systems, but no-tillage lost about 0.7 to 1.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 more C than did plow tillage. Carbon in the medium-density fraction (density = 1.6-2.0 g mL-1) of the 0- to 20-cm soil layer was 30% higher (P ≤ 0.05) under no-tillage. Light (density &lt; 1.6 g mL-1) and heavy (density &gt; 2.0 g mL-1) organic fractions, total C, and microbial biomass and activity in the 0- to 20-cm layer were not different in no-tilled and plowed soils, despite different patterns of distribution with depth. The rates of organic C mineralization during laboratory incubations were the same for both tillage systems. We propose that, after an accumulation phase, soil under no-tillage loses higher amounts of CO2-C than under plowing. The use of no-tillage would not significantly affect soil organic matter pools of the region in situations with low erosion losses.},

abstract={Abandonment of degraded and marginal agricultural land is a widespread phenomenon in Spain and other Mediterranean countries. To study soil development and site dynamics, a comparative investigation of field groups representing different ages of abandonment was realized in the Meastrazgo region of the Mediterranean province of Castellón. Analysis of soil samples for organic carbon and total nitrogen content and pH showed that a sufficient regeneration of organic matter is accomplished after 20 years of fallow. Contrary to this there is no build-up of 'available' phosphorus after abandonment. A fixation of phosphorus in unavailable forms in the first fallow years seems evident, and there is no re-enrichment through solution or mineralization of organically bound P thereafter. The vegetation of the fallow fields develops after passing through a low-cover therophyte stage within 10-20 years to nanophanerophyte-dominated matorral (shrubs), in the best case within 40-50 years to a stone oak juniper association. Under intensive cattle grazing, grasslands rich in hemicryptophytes evolved. Rates of soil erosion estimated through application of the Universal Soil Loss Equation are of medium to low intensity and range between 2·2 t ha-1 year-1 in the first fallow years and 0·6 t ha-1 year-1 after establishment of vegetation cover. Under grassland erosion is negligible unless vegetative cover is destroyed through treading. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Soil erosion is a major threat to sustaining agricultural production in Tanzania. However, quantitative information is scanty on its effects on yields of major crops for principal soils and management practices. We conducted this study to determine erosion effects on soil moisture, related property and corn yield on Tropeptic Haplustox and Ultic Haplustalf soils at Mlingano in Tanzania. Four erosion classes (least, slight, moderate, and severe) on Tropeptic Haplustox and three erosion classes (slight, moderate, and severe) on Ultic Haplustalf were established according to the thickness of the Ap horizon under natural field conditions. Accelerated soil erosion reduced soil moisture content, soil organic carbon, available water capacity and water use efficiency. Mean volumetric soil moisture content (average of both soils) during the growing season was 2.3% for severe, 24.8% for moderate, and 25.7% for slight erosion. Mean soil organic carbon content was 1.15% for severe, 1.64% for moderate and 1.97% for slight erosion. Mean available water capacity was 2.6 cm for severe, 3.5 cm for moderate, and 4.0 cm for slight erosion. Soil bulk density and excessive degree days of soil temperature above 25°C increased with severity of erosion. These adverse changes accentuated constraints on crop growth and reduced corn (Zea mays) yield on severely eroded soil by 45% and 59% for Tropeptic Haplustox and Ultic Haplustalf soils, respectively. The water use efficiency of corn was 21.6 kg ha-1 cm-1 in the least eroded class versus 17 kg ha-1 cm-1 in the severely eroded class for the Tropetic Haplustox, and 23 kg ha-1 cm-1 in the slightly eroded and 18.1 kg ha-1 cm-1 in the severely eroded class for Ultic Haplustalf.},

abstract={Declining water quality on the south coast of Western Australia has been associated with increasing input of nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), from diffuse agricultural sources. A survey of surface (0-10 cm) soil properties (ammonium oxalate extractable iron, bicarbonate extractable P and K, pH, organic carbon and salinity) from 7950 sites mostly on agricultural land, along with information on fertiliser practices, land use, soil type, rainfall and time since agricultural development reveals patterns of nutrient status and fertiliser practice, and improved understanding of potential nutrient export hazards. Significant increases in soil bicarbonate extractable P and K have been brought about by continued traditional application of P based fertilisers. Soil organic carbon decreased after clearing, but then increased as soil fertility increased. There has been little change in soil pH or salinity. A significant interaction between time since agricultural development and ammonium oxalate extractable Fe indicated that the rate of change and absolute value of soil bicarbonate extractable P increased as time and ammonium oxalate extractable Fe increased. Soils with low ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (400 mg kg-1) reach a maximum soil bicarbonate P more quickly (&lt; 30 yr) than soils with high ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (&gt; 30 yr). Optimum land management should be based around the reducing P leaching through sandy soils with low ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (low P retention), and reducing runoff and erosion from soils with high ammonium oxalate extractable Fe (high P retention) and a long fertiliser history. More than half of the soils tested contained sufficient bicarbonate extractable P (high P status) to forego P applications for at least one year; however, 90% received P applications independently of the soil test information. Two thirds of the high P status soils were deficient in S, whilst 25% were deficient in K. Correcting these nutrient deficiencies would reduce the rate of increase in soil P and reduce the P loss export hazard.},

abstract={Erosion changes soil properties, removes nutrients and alters crop yields. A knowledge of these impacts on soil productivity is needed for economic analyses of erosion and conservation. Based on a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization experimental design to monitor these changes, results are reported from four research sites in southern Brazil on Ferralsols and Cambisols, enabling the construction of erosion-yield-time and nutrient loss relationships. Plot experiments ran for up to seven years of natural erosion, followed by one or two years of maize cropping. A remarkably consistent composite erosion-yield relationship in logarithmic form was found, showing a sharp yield decline with initial soil loss. Soil 'resilience' was identified through erosion-time relationships, 'sensitivity' through erosion-yield equations. As erosion progressed, losses of nutrients, especially of organic carbon and calcium, were significant. In situ, changes in soil properties were far less marked. Together with measured yield reductions caused by cumulative erosion, these results enabled the modelling of changes in soil productivity over time with respect to both soil quality and impact on yields. A production 'half-life' of between one and 39 years according to soil type and level of erosion was also identified.},

abstract={In fields on slopes, colluvium can accumulate against a field bank so that the surface of the eroded field is at a higher level than the field immediately downslope. This creates a drop down from the upper field to the lower. These features, step-like in cross section, form during cultivation and survive in land that has reverted to pasture without the normal restoration of soil upslope being undertaken. The presence of such a deposit distorts the downslope pattern of moisture movement in that a component of this flow is now towards the field bank from which it often seeps. To ascertain if the formation and survival of these colluvium deposits can affect soil property variation, a study was carried out in three fields at three different sites in mid-County Down. Data on organic carbon, pH, pyrophosphate extractable iron, dithionite extractable iron and mass specific magnetic susceptibility were obtained from detailed sampling of ten profiles located at approximately ten metre intervals downslope in each field. These data were examined graphically. Results show that downslope changes in soil properties are influenced by surface wash, as well as by the development of a saturated wedge and longer soil moisture residence times, following the alteration of pathways of moisture movement, in the vicinity of the colluvial deposits.},

abstract={When the aggregate stability of soils is evaluated under water-saturated conditions by conventional methods of wet-sieving at fixed times (5 to 20 min), the dynamic features of aggregate breakdown are often lost or ignored. An exponential equation, y(t) = a[1 - exp(-t/c)] + b, is proposed to describe the dynamic features of aggregate breakdown as a function of wet-sieving time. Parameter a is the maximum estimated abrasion loss of aggregates, b is the incipient failure of the aggregates when saturated in water, and c is a parameter that links the rate of aggregate breakdown to wet-sieving time. The equation was validated with experimental data using 100 samples of a wide range of Italian topsoils developed on Tertiary deposits. With R2 values close to unity for fitting data from all 100 soil samples, the equation described successfully the dynamics of aggregate breakdown, and the parameters accounted for variations among the soils based on soil type, parent material, and land use. We also scale the exponential equations for the 100 soils with scaling factors to define a scale mean curve for the aggregate breakdown of all soils. The scale factors were obtained by minimizing an objective function containing measured values of aggregate loss and the scale mean curve. The magnitude of the scaling factor gives a quantitative estimate of aggregate stability (the larger its value, the greater the aggregate stability) for each soil, whereas the particular values of parameters a, b, and c describe the kinetics of aggregate breakdown for each soil. A multivariate analysis showed that the value of the scale factors depends significantly on the amounts of amorphous iron oxides and organic carbon in the topsoil as well as on the topographical elevation of the soil surface.},

abstract={We investigated the effects of 2 different grazing regimes on the surface soil properties of a dunefield land system in the semi-arid woodlands of eastern Australia. Sandy siliceous, thermic Xeric Haplargids (Siliceous Sands, Uc1.23) occur on the sandy, 2-4-m-high longitudinal dunes. Fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Xeric Haplargids (Massive Red Earths, Uc2.13) occur in the swales between the dunes. We compared very high-intensity grazing (approx. 1 year) by feral goats with low-intensity grazing (approx. 4 years) by sheep. A rainfall simulator, applying water at the rate of 30 mm/h, measured the hydraulic properties of the surface soils formed under the 2 different grazing regimes. We examined undisturbed samples of the upper 5-cm layer of the soil surface using micromorphological techniques. In the swales, there were no differences in the effects of the 2 grazing regimes on soil properties. At low-intensity sheep grazing (0.2-0-3 sheep/ha), the soil surface on the dunes remained in an excellent condition. The surface had a good vegetative cover and consisted of either loosely packed sand grains, or areas where the sand grains were bonded together by clay and organic matter to form an organic crust. The total carbon content of the 0-2 cm depth of soil was 0.86%. Both soil surfaces have a high infiltration rate (i.e. >30 mm/h) and also appear to contain stable microaggregates of parna material distributed among the eolian sand grains. Very high-intensity goat grazing (up to 4.0 goats/ha) rapidly depleted the perennial grasses, killed most of the shrubs, and converted the soil surface on the dunes to one highly susceptible to erosion by wind. The low total carbon content (depth 0-2 cm) of 0.3% and absence of iron-stained clay coatings on the sands further support this view. The surface soil on the dunes in the very high-intensity goat-grazing plots consisted of either loosely packed sand grains or areas where poorly orientated clays coated the sand grains to form a strong, physical crust. We suggest that the physical crust may cause a change in the hydrology of the land system which may enhance the conditions for recruitment of unpalatable shrubs in the dune-swale interface. This increase in unpalatable shrubs and decrease in perennial grasses caused by the very high intensity goat grazing is therefore detrimental to the long-term productivity of these semi-arid lands.},

abstract={The severity of accelerated erosion is affected by slope gradient, slope shape, slope length, and tillage practices. Fly ash, the product of high temperature coal combustion, has been used previously as a sedimentation marker, but it has never been used on the upland as an indicator of soil loss from erosion. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of soil removal from a hillslope as a result of accelerated erosion and its subsequent deposition on a lower landscape position using the presence, depth distribution, and concentration of fly ash, organic carbon, and magnetic susceptibility to identify the remaining original soil as well as a sediment marker. The study was carried out by comparing the amount of fly ash contained in the soil profile at different landscape positions of a cultivated site with that in an uncultivated woodland site. Fly ash deposition began in 1855 with traffic on the Illinois Central railroad between Chicago and Cairo, Illinois. In 1889 and 1928, additional rail lines were located closer to both sites. Organic C, magnetic-mineral content, and magnetic susceptibility decreased regularly with depth at both sites. Magnetic susceptibility was generally higher on the uncultivated site compared with the cultivated site for all landscape positions except the lower footslope. Compared with the uncultivated site, there was 50% less fly ash on interfluve and shoulder landscape segments of the cultivated site, 35% less on the backslope, and 67% less on the depositional lower footslope position. When the entire transect site is considered, the cultivated site had 47% less fly ash in the upper 22.5-cm soil profile compared with the uncultivated site. These results indicated that 10.6 cm, or 47%, of the upper soil layer has been eroded from the hillslope since 1855 (142 years) as a result of accelerated erosion induced by cultivation. For the backslope, the presence of 65%, or 15 cm, of the original surface soil layers and 67% of the fly ash at the cultivated site places the soil in the moderately eroded phase of the Grantsburg soil.},

abstract={The wisdom of intensive market garden crop cultivation on vertisols in Martinique is now being questioned as it leads to soil deterioration: in relation to intensified prairies, which conserve and even rehabilitate the soil, ploughing market garden crop plots reduces carbon contents and increases susceptibility to erosion. We set out to proposed practices that would preserve both the soil and yields whilst remaining profitable. Compared to ploughing our study showed that more superficial land preparation 1) limited the reduction in organic stocks, facilitated drainage and better preserved biological activity; 2) did not lead to any significant drop in yields; and 3) reduced work times and cut mechanization rates by 26 to 65% and investments in equipment by up to 40%. Superficial preparation proved to be more profitable and to protect the soil more effectively, but there were still risks of soil loss. Introducing market garden crop/pasture rotation would maintain high yields and enable truly sustainable environmental management.},

abstract={Mechanisms of organic carbon (OC) and P enrichment in sediment eroded from well-aggregated soils are not well understood. This study was conducted to examine why OC and extractable P (ext-P) were enriched in sediment with a well-aggregated Oxisol. Soil samples presented four field treatments: no fertilization (NF), short-term P fertilization (STP), long-term P fertilization (LTP), and organic waste fertilization (OW). Organic C in dry- sieved aggregates increased with decreasing aggregate size for all treatments, suggesting that OC is preferentially retained in small aggregates and, perhaps, protected from microbial attack. Extractable P concentration changed little with aggregate size for the NF treatment, but increased significantly with decreasing aggregate size for the STP and OW treatments and for liquid-P incubated NF soil. This difference was attributed to the blockage of interior sorption sites within large aggregates. Breakdown of dry STP and OW aggregates by simulated storms produced fine aggregates that were richer in OC and ext-P than the original larger ones. Most of the fine aggregates were created in the early phase of rainfall by slaking dry aggregates, and further breakdown by stripping water-stable aggregates was more difficult and slow. Sediment enrichment observed in eroded sediment was caused by selective transport of P and OC-rich fine aggregates induced by the effects of aggregation blockage and aggregate breakdown by slaking and stripping. For the LTP treatment, however, ext-P concentration was independent of aggregate size, indicating that a uniform P distribution in aggregates can be reached given sufficiently long equilibration time.

abstract={Studies of the impact of traditional agroforestry practices on soil nutrient status in the Amazon Basin have largely been limited to upland sites, many of which are oligotrophic. However, rural population density in Amazonia is highest on the floodplains of the major rivers and shifting cultivation has been practiced on the floodplains for millennia. We established a slash-and-burn cultivation plot and an untreated forest plot in tidal floodplain successional forest in the Islands of Abaetetuba, Pará, Brazil, and sampled soils (0-10 cm) during four phases of the agroforest cycle (n = 9 in each plot for each sampling period): (1) prior to clearing, (2) following burning, (3) harvest one (rice at four months), and (4) harvest two (sugar cane at 15 months). During the course of this pilot experiment, background temporal variability in SOC, total N and available mineral nutrient pools (P, K, Ca, Mg) exceeded treatment effects, suggesting that soil nutrient pools in this environment are well-buffered against the effects of shifting cultivation. These results contrast markedly with those reported for Amazonian upland sites where nutrient pulses and declines associated with the agroforest cycle have been demonstrated and may restrict the potential for low-input, continuous cultivation. Physical limitations imposed by flooding and fluvial erosion, rather than nutrient constraints, restrict the potential of agricultural intensification in the tidal floodplains. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Vegetation and soil properties were described across a well-dated sand-dune chronosequence bordering northern Lake Michigan to document patterns and rates of primary succession and forest ecosystem development, and to determine environmental constraints that potentially drive succession and regulate species diversity. The site experienced frequent and continuing formation of 72 shore-parallel dune ridges over the past 2375 yr. Across the chronosequence represented by the youngest 13 dune ridges aged 25-440 yr, there were clear patterns of species turnover and community convergence as well as successional changes in species diversity, aboveground biomass, aboveground litter production, net ecosystem production, nutrient pools, and nutrient cycling. Dune-building species were replaced by evergreen shrubs and bunchgrass within 100 yr, which in turn, were replaced by mixed pine forest within 345 yr. Plant-species richness increased to a peak in developing forest at 285 yr but thereafter decreased as early-successional species disappeared from the communities. Rates of species addition peaked between 95 and 145 yr as forest species invaded, whereas rates of species loss peaked between 345 and 440 yr as early-successional species were lost from the developing forest. Development of the forest ecosystem required ~300 yr (i.e., 145-440 years). Total ecosystem carbon increased in a logistic manner to 128 Mg C/ha, with net ecosystem production peaking at 30 g C·m-2·yr-1 in developing forest. Aboveground biomass and O horizon mass increased to ~137 Mg/ha and ~79 Mg/ha, respectively, whereas aboveground litter production increased to 3.5 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 at 440 yr, but thereafter varied between 175 and 350 Mg·ha-1·yr-1. Total carbon and total nitrogen in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil and O horizon accumulated to ~42 Mg/ha and ~1.36 Mg/ha, respectively. Estimated average rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation over 440 yr of ecosystem aggradation were 23.2 g·m-2·yr-1 for carbon and 0.38 g·m-2·yr-1 for nitrogen. Because nitrogen-fixing plants are rare on the upland dune ridges, ecosystem aggradation depends largely on atmospheric nitrogen inputs. Following colonization by conifers, soil acidification resulted in rapid leaching losses of calcium and magnesium, whereas phosphorus and potassium were cycled more tightly. The dune chronosequence represents a complex gradient of changing environmental constraints that differentially reduce the survival, growth, and reproduction of plant species. Young dune ridges near the lake shore are characterized by strong winds, sand burial and erosion, high insolation, high rates of evaporation, and low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus. These conditions ameliorate with increasing dune age as wind velocities and sand movement diminish with distance from the lake, as accumulating organic matter improves the moisture-holding capacity and nitrogen availability of the soil, and as mineral weathering mobilizes soil phosphorus. However, in developing forest, light and cationic nutrients may become limiting, and decreased light availability, cool soil temperatures, and accumulation of a thick forest floor may limit recruitment from seed for many species. These numerous potential environmental constraints suggest a considerable complexity in this ostensibly simple ecosystem.},

abstract={Striking similarities and sharp contrasts exist between the geochemistries of organic matter in surface soils and marine sediments. The contrasts result in part from physical differences in the two environments and their indigenous biota. Vascular plants predominate on land, where soils are deeply leached by percolating water and receive organic matter from falling debris and penetrating roots. The large size of vascular plants, and their high concentrations of carbon-rich biomacromolecules such as cellulose, lignin and tannin, necessitate recycling by aggressive consortia of microorganisms, including fungi armed with O2-requiring oxidative enzymes. In the ocean, nitrogen-rich microorganisms produce and recycle most organic matter in the water column, from which degraded particles rain onto the underlying sea floor. Water saturation restricts O2 penetration into sediments accumulating along most continental margins to less than several centimeters, below which biomacromolecules must be broken down hydrolytically with nitrate and sulfate as the primary electron acceptors. In both soils and sediments, plant products are degraded extensively by microorganisms, leaving small organic remnants which are soluble in base and depleted in conventionally measurable biochemicals. Much of the surviving organic matter is intimately associated with mineral surfaces and enclosed within particle aggregates, and thus may be physically protected from microbial attack. Degradation under oxic conditions is severe both on land and within surface ocean deposits. As a result, even physically protected organic matter can slowly be mineralized, along with intrinsically resistant substrates such as lignin, pollen, kerogen and coal. The only long-term shelter from mineralization is within anoxic marine sediments which accumulate one mole of organic carbon for every 500-1000 fixed by photosynthetic organisms. The buried organic matter joins the geological cycle, surfacing again millions of years later as kerogen uplifted in continental rocks. Chemists investigating organic matter in soils or sediments employ distinct strategies and experimental methods for disparate purposes. Soil studies focus primarily on bulk properties linked to complex system functions such as fertility and erosion. Investigations of sedimentary organic matter are more molecularly-based and directed toward interpretations of water column processes and paleorecords. With the pressing need for more efficient large-scale research, the time is ripe for increased interchange between chemists studying subaerial and subaqueous systems. Combination of methods (such as preparative particle sorting and solid-state NMR) for determining the forms and physical distributions of organic matter in soils, with highly sensitive tracer techniques being developed in the aquatic field is a particularly promising crossover area. The aim of this review is to facilitate such interactions between soil and sedimentary organic geochemists by a comparative evaluation of conditions, concepts and opportunities in both fields.

abstract={Microbial biomass and activity of tropical and temperate soils from Brazil and England, respectively, were measured during 150 days incubation at 15°C and 35°C. Extractable carbon was determined by the fumigation-extraction method giving initial biomass values ranges from 160-600 μg C.g-1 soil for tropical soils and from 400-1300 μg C.g-1 soil for temperate soils. It was evident from all soils (except a tropical one) that biomass at 35°C decreased more, over a long incubation period, than at 15°C; the temperate soils had the highest decrease at 35°C. Death rate of biomass quotient (qD) calculated over the 150 days period of incubation showed that tropical and temperate soils, at 15°C. have similar values, but at 35°C temperate soils had higher rates than tropical soils, confirming the existence of some sensitivity of temperate soils to elevated temperature. Carbon from carbon dioxide (CO2-C) was also measured for all soils investigated. There was a greater respiration rate at 35°C than at 15°C for all the soils. The temperate soils showed faster mineralization rate than the tropical, mainly at 35°C. At this temperature the amounts of CO2-C respired were from 2 to 9 times as much carbon as was present in the original biomass, indicating that this carbon could only have come from the soil organic matter. Biomass specific respiration rate (mg CO2-C evolved.g-1 biomass.day-1) showed greater values for temperate soils at both temperatures; at 15°C the rate was 2.7 times greater and at 35°C the rate was 2.4 times greater. These results suggest that there is more available energy in the temperate soils than in the tropical soils, reinforcing that there is more carbon stored in microbial biomass of temperate soils. Comments are made on a possible contribution of microorganisms, mainly of temperate soils, to global warming, in case of a global atmospheric temperature elevation. However, it is important to consider other factors inherent to soil characteristics (i.e. organic matter added to soil, its plant cover, soil erosion, deforestation and climatic changes) as possibly stronger causes of global warming.},

abstract={World soils represent the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon (C), about 1550 Pg compared with about 700 Pg in the atmosphere and 600 Pg in land biota. Agricultural activities (e.g., deforestation, burning, plowing, intensive grazing) contribute considerably to the atmospheric pool. Expansion of agriculture may have contributed substantially to the atmospheric carbon pool. However, the exact magnitude of carbon fluxes from soil to the atmosphere and from land biota to the soil are not known. An important objective of the sustainable management of soil resources is to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by increasing passive or non-labile fraction. Soil surface management, soil water conservation and management, and soil fertility regulation are all important aspects of carbon sequestration in soil. Conservation tillage, a generic term implying all tillage methods that reduce runoff and soil erosion in comparison with plow-based tillage, is known to increase SOC content of the surface layer. Principal mechanisms of carbon sequestration with conservation tillage are increase in micro-aggregation and deep placement of SOC in the sub-soil horizons. Other useful agricultural practices associated with conservation tillage are those that increase biomass production (e.g., soil fertility enhancement, improved crops and species, cover crops and fallowing, improved pastures and deep-rooted crops). It is also relevant to adopt soil and crop management systems that accentuate humification and increase the passive fraction of SOC. Because of the importance of C sequestration, soil quality should be evaluated in terms of its SOC content. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={The land surface of the Lena Delta is covered by polygon structures with scattered pingos and dunes. There exist so-called aerated, swampy and open polygons (open water surface) with Gelic Gleysols and Gelic Histosols (gelundic phase). The soils show only minor signs of cryoturbation and weathering. They contain high amounts of silt and slightly decomposed organic matter down to soil depths far beyond the permafrost table during summer. The soil surface is rising due to accumulation of organic matter and periodic flooding. This leads to a continuous rise of the permafrost table and subsequently to a permafrost freeze storage of plant material. The soils are therefore effective carbon sinks. On top of an investigated pingo a Glcyi-gelic Cambisol developed due to windexposed position, good drainage and higher soil temperatures connnected with a deeper permafrost table. This soil did not show any signs of cryoturbation. It has a relatively low content of organic matter due to a higher mineralization. As a consequence of frost effected sorting and wind erosion the soil material near to the surface is rich in sand and has a reduced silt content. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1997.},

abstract={The export of organic carbon (POC and DOC) via the Vorfluter was measured in summer 1996 in the Upper Baselbieter Jura. The aim of the study was to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of organic carbon in the landscape ecosystem and to balance the total loss of hydrologically exported organic carbon at the level of the catchment area. At the same time an attempt was made to ascertain whether conclusions about current soil erosion in the catchment area are possible from carbon measurements in the Vorfluter. The results show that the POC/DOC ratio during flood waves permit clear conclusions about current soil erosion. Although the Vorfluter showed high DOC and POC concentrations the hydrological export of carbon is slight compared to other values (eg soil respiration). On the other hand the eutrophicating effect of the export of organic carbon on aquatic ecosystems should not be underestimated.},

abstract={Recovery of degraded semiarid rangeland is influenced by the degree of soil erosion and changes in soil physical and chemical properties that follow the loss of herbaceous cover. The objectives of this study were to compare changes in physical and chemical properties of a chaparral soil protected from grazing for 18 years, and to evaluate these changes relative to succession and threshold paradigms. Litter and soil samples were collected beneath shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella), birchleaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides) and open spaces between shrubs in a livestock exclosure and the surrounding grazed area. Additional soil was collected beneath shrub live oak and from open spaces between shrubs for a bioassay of soil fertility within the exclosure and the grazed area using oats (Arena sativa) as the indicator species. Percentage silt and clay were greater and percentage sand was lower within the exclosure. Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were greater in soil beneath mountain mahogany and from shrubless openings within the exclosure compared to the grazed area, but not beneath shrub live oak. Soil from shrubless openings in the exclosure produced greater oat shoot weights compared to soil from open spaces in the grazed area, but there was no difference in oat shoot weights between grazed and protected areas beneath shrub live oak. Shoot weights increased in response to nitrogen and nitrogen + phosphorus, but not phosphorus alone, indicating the site was primarily nitrogen limited. Improvements in soil physical and chemical properties within the exclosure did not result in recovery of herbaceous vegetation in open areas between shrubs. A very heterogeneous distribution pattern in soil properties, characterized by large differences between soils under shrubs compared to open areas between shrubs, was evident within the exclosure and in the grazed area, indicating the presence of a degraded ecosystem. Improvements in soil physical and chemical properties within the exclosure represent an upward trend within a stable threshold of lower productivity, rather than a slow return to climax condition.},

A technique is proposed for calculating the local directions and relative intensities of temporary water-erosion flows. A classification is given for the microrelief forms that determine the increase and decrease in Corg content of soil. A conclusion is made that the natural variation in Corg content is continuously reproduced and is not eliminated by field management procedures.},

abstract={Chaillexon lake (Doubs, France) has been settled by a rock collapse about 12,000 years ago. That trap represents a continuous sedimentary record for the late and post-glacial period. The optical analysis of the organic matter settled in the Meso-Cenozoic substratum of the watershed and in the sedimentary infilling points out the incorporation of Meso-Cenozoic organic matter in the late and post-glacial organic detrital supply. This incorporation mainly occurred from late glacial to Preboreal periods (12,000-9,000 B.P.) showing that during this time vegetal and soil covers were poorly developed and did not allow a significant protection of the bedrock from erosional processes. This protection started only at the beginning of Boreal (9 000 B.P.). These results and besides the presence of Meso-Cenozoic organic matter mainly composed with opaque particles (coal debris) allow us two remarks : - such particles found in recent sediments must not be systematically interpreted as fire signals, - a watershed without any vegetal cover can nevertheless provide organic carbon.},

abstract={Dryland crop production is limited by precipitation and by soil factors such as texture and profile depth that affect water storage capacity, pH, fertility, and salinity. When prevailing precipitation and soil factors are not in balance, crops will not yield at their potential and productivity may be impaired because soil degradation processes outweigh conservation practices. Sustainable crop production is possible through use of appropriate tillage and crop residue management practices. When adequate crop residues are available, conservation tillage is highly effective for conserving soil and water, achieving favorable crop yields, maintaining soil organic carbon contents, and soil and water quality. Other tillage methods along with appropriate conservation practices may be needed when crop residues are limited.},

abstract={Conversion of natural forests to agriculture in the humid tropics leads to a reduction in ecosystem carbon storage due to the immediate removal of aboveground biomass and a gradual subsequent reduction in soil organic carbon. A considerable part of soil carbon is protected from microbial attack by a range of physical and chemical mechanisms and is not sensitive to landuse change. We analyzed the soils data base for Sumatra (Indonesia) developed by the Center for Soil and Agroclimate Research (CSAR) to estimate-effects of landuse on soil C content. Sumatra has a considerable diversity of soils ranging from those of recent origin in the highlands, to older sedimentary and heavily leached soils in the pedimont peneplain and large areas of wetland soils along the coast. Peat soils (Histosols) and other wetland soils (Aquic and Fluvic suborders) contain the greatest soil C reserves, followed by young volcanic soils (Andisols). Agricultural use of these soils can have a disproportionately large effect on C release to the atmosphere. On the major part of the upland soils the difference in (top) soil C content between natural forest and agricultural land is in the range 0.5-1.0% C, equivalent to a change in total C stock of 10-20 Mg ha-1. These results agree with data collected in S. Sumatra in the 1930s. C(org) of forest soils is related to soil pH, and is lowest in the pH range 5.0-6.0. Wetland conditions, lower pH, higher altititude (lower temperature) and higher clay and silt content all contributed to higher soil C contents in a multiple regression analysis of the whole data set. Existing models and data sets are insufficient to predict changes in soil C contents under various landuse practices. Carbon isotope studies, and especially the δ 13C method may be used to study the effects of landuse change, especially when the vegetation was changed from one dominated by C3 plants (most forest species) to one dominated by grasses and crops with a C4 photosynthetic pathway. Results from Brazil documented a gradual decline of organic matter originating from the forest system and its partial replacement by organic matter derived from inputs of sugarcane during the first fifty years of cultivation. Forest conversion to well managed grasslands may lead to an increased soil C storage, after an initial decline. The consequences of erosion on losses of soil C depend on the scale at which these losses are considered, because of sedimentation processes. When net erosion losses are not expressed per unit area, but per length scale to the power 1.6, erosion losses appear to be largely independent of scale. The 'fractal dimension of erosion' (on average around 1.6) probably is a landscape characteristic and estimates of its value are needed for extrapolation. Better understanding of soil C deposition sites is needed to evaluate overall erosion effects and test whether or not erosion can contribute to net C sequestration.},

abstract={Effects of erosion-induced degradation on soil chemical quality, plant nutrient loss in runoff water and water quality were related to slope length for a 5-year study from 1984 through 1988 conducted on tropical Alfisols under maize (Zea mays)-cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata) rotation. A total of 13 field runoff plots involved six slope lengths (i.e. 60 m, 50 m, 40 m, 30 m, 20 m, and 10 m), two tillage methods (i.e. conventional till and no-till), and an uncropped control of 25 m length. Slope length effects on soil chemical quality differed among tillage methods. Decrease in slope length had a favorable effect on soil chemical quality in the conventional till treatment for exchangeable Ca2+, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and Bray-P. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased with decrease in slope length at the rate of 0·007 per cent m-1 for 0-5 cm depth and 0·015 per cent m-1 for 5-10 cm depth, and soil pH decreased with increase in slope length. Soil concentration of Bray-1 P generally increased with decrease in slope length. For the no-till treatment, however, there were no consistent trends in soil chemical quality with regard to slope length. Further, soil chemical quality was superior under no-till than conventional till treatment for 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths. All soil chemical properties declined with cultivation duration, with the rate of decline being more in conventional till compared with the no-till treatment. The rate of decline for the conventional till treatment was 0·396 per cent year-1 for SOC, 0·21 unit year-1 for pH, 0·053 per cent year-1 for total soil N, 0·375 cmol kg-1 year-1 for Ca2+, and 0·41 cmol kg-1 year-1 for CEC. The rate of decline in soil quality with cultivation duration was consistently more for longer than for shorter slope lengths especially for SOC and soil pH. Temporal changes in soil chemical quality for the no-till treatment were not well defined. The total loss of plant nutrients in runoff ranged from 8-4 kg ha-1 to 17·8 kg ha-1 for season 1, and, in general, the nutrient loss decreased with decrease in slope length. The total loss of plant nutrients in season 2 was lower than that in season 1, and lower with no-till compared with conventional till treatment. Total nutrient loss in runoff decreased with increase in slope length for conventional tillage, and increased with decrease in slope length for the no-till treatment. Concentration of plant nutrient in runoff differed among elements, tillage methods and slope length treatments. Concentration of bases and NO3-N in runoff followed a U-shape response over time during the year, with relatively high concentrations toward the beginning and end of the rains. The concentration of PO4-P in runoff generally decreased with time after application of fertilizer. For the conventional till treatment, the concentration of PO4-P, K, and Fe decreased with decrease in slope length. © 1997 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Yungui Plateau lakes in southwestern China are economically important, although few have been studied previously. Water and sediments of 24 lakes throughout Yunnan Province were sampled in October 1994. We describe the chemical and physical characteristics of Yunnan lakes, and address effects of regional geology and human influences on water quality and sediment type. Water quality differs between deep Yunnan lakes of tectonic origin and shallow solution basins. Shallow lakes generally have higher nutrient concentrations and appear to be more susceptible to riparian disturbance than deeper lakes. Shallow lakes with high macrophyte standing crops, nevertheless, exhibit nutrient-poor waters. Principal ions Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3- reflect regional carbonate geology, except in Cheng Hai, which is a sodium bicarbonate lake. Specific conductance and δ18O are positively correlated, indicating that evaporation concentrates both solutes and 18O. Large, shallow lakes in south-eastern Yunnan exhibit 18O-enriched waters because of substantial evaporation, whereas small, deep lakes are 18O-depleted. Lake waters are 18O-depleted in small, shallow basins that receive substantial rainwater input relative to their small volumes. 18O enrichment in Cheng Hai suggests that a recent 5-m water-level decline in this lake was caused by increased evaporation or diversion of freshwater inflow. Yunnan watersheds have undergone substantial deforestation, agricultural cultivation, soil erosion, and industrialization. Limnetic nutrient concentrations indicate that human activities have affected water quality. Organic matter content is low in sediments because of increased non-carbonate, clastic sediment yield from watersheds. Environmental policies are needed to balance ecological contraints with economic activities that impact water quality.},

abstract={Good-quality soil is important for crop production sustainability of agricultural lands. An indicator of soil quality is the soil organic carbon (OC) concentration, which affects the soil dry aggregate (DA) and water-stable aggregate (WSA) size distribution. These, in turn, affect the soil quality. This study was conducted to establish relationships among various DA, WSA, and soil OC variables of a Torrertic Paleustoll (Pullman clay loam) using simple, polynomial, and multiple regression procedures. Samples were obtained from a depth of 0-3 cm of 18 differently managed dryland treatment areas or fields at Bushland, Texas, USA, to determine DA and WSA size distributions and OC concentrations of bulk soil. The water stability and OC of aggregates obtained by dry sieving were determined also. Areas sampled ranged from plots or fields cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands converted to cropland in 1994. Of the 110 relationships analyzed, 63 were significant at P ≤0.05 and another 23 were related at P levels of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40. Variables involving the 0.84 to 2.0 mm DAs often were significantly related to various other DA and WSA variables and to soil OC variables, including a positive relationship with bulk soil OC. The DAs in this size range resist erosion by wind. Because of their significant relationship with WSAs, they are important also for maintaining water infiltration, thereby reducing the potential for erosion by water and increasing the potential for greater soil water storage. Practices such as reduced or no-tillage retain crop residues on the soil surface and thereby maintain or enhance surface soil OC concentrations, which enhance the development of DAs in this size range. By inference, these practices, therefore, are important also for maintaining production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils.},

abstract={The 31-km2 aufeis ice sheet of the upper Firth River holds a wealth of information on groundwater hydrology in periglacial environments. Baseflow recession calculations, corrected for aufeis storage (12% of basin discharge), indicate specific groundwater recharge rates of up to 100 mm yr-1 (up to 50% of runoff), suggesting a significant proportion of drainage from karst. The upper Firth River aufeis is a composite aufeis, with discrete baseflow contributions from different watersheds. Since the late Pleistocene, annual growth of the aufeis has exerted a strong control on lateral erosion and the local river channel geomorphology. Two groundwater recharge processes are distinguished on the basis of carbonate geochemistry and δ13C: (1) Methanogenic groundwaters, with 13C(DIC) up to -3.3‰, are recharged through saturated soils underlain by permafrost; conditions which support anaerobic consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and produce up to 700 μg-CH4 L-1 (calculated), and (2) Karst groundwaters, with 13C-depleted DIC, recharged through unsaturated soils and circulate through fissured talik in the carbonate bedrock. Most drainage from the region shows varying contributions of these two groundwaters, although a greater contribution from the methanogenic groundwaters occurs in north-facing watersheds. The δ13C values for cryogenic calcite precipitates in the ice indicate that the karst ground-waters are the major contribution to aufeis growth. The combined use of δ13C(DIC) and geochemistry may be a useful tool to quantify methanogenesis in northern watersheds.},

abstract={Surface crusting results from aggregate breakdown under raindrop impact. It reduces the infiltration rate and may induce erosion by increasing runoff. Soil crustability and erodibility generally increase as organic carbon content decreases. Samples of topsoil were collected from fields cropped continuously for maize after land clearance at various dates. Organic carbon content ranged 4-30 g kg-1. Aggregate stability was assessed by measuring fragment size distribution after different treatments. Samples were also subjected to simulated rainfall. The size of fragments forming the seal when the rain ceased and the infiltration rate during the rainfall were measured to characterize seal structure and hydraulic properties. Development of the seal and infiltration capacity were related to aggregate stability, which was itself a function of organic carbon content. The relations between aggregate breakdown, crusting and infiltration enabled us to predict soil physical behaviour from measurements of aggregate stability which are easier to make than direct measurements under rainfall. The proposed tests offer the opportunity to evaluate actual or potential soil physical degradation and erosion risks without extensive field measurements.},

abstract={Bryophytes and lichens associated with soil crusts were sampled over 500,000 km2 of rangelands in semi-arid eastern Australia. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to examine the relationships between a range of environmental variables and the distribution of these species from a subset of 130 samples from 87 sites. CCA revealed that bryophytes were related to total annual rainfall, soil pH, calcium carbonate levels, plant cover, texture, organic carbon, and soil texture. Lichens were related to annual rainfall, pH, calcium carbonate levels, plant cover, sheet erosion, organic carbon, and crust cover. Rainfall is a primary determinant of plant cover, which in turn affects light, nutrient availability, and litter levels, and therefore bryophyte and lichen distribution. On the basis of the first two ordination axes, bryophytes and lichens clustered into loose arrangements of species, based on their responses to the environmental variables.},

abstract={Slash and-burn rice production systems in northern Laos are undergoing dramatic changes. Increased population pressure and regulations limiting access to land have resulted in shorter fallow periods. Limited information is available on nutrient dynamics in slash and-burn systems of Southeast Asia in general and particularly on effects of reduced fallow length. Crop and fallow effects on soil parameters and fallow vegetation were quantified in slash-and-burn fields in Luang Prabang, northern Laos from 1991 to 1994. Over the cropping season from May to October declines of 8,7, and 3% organic C and 33, 40, and 53% extractable P, were observed for the depth intervals of 0-3, 3-10 and 10-25 cm, respectively. Over the same period extractable K declined by 34% in the 0-3 cm interval and increased by 15 and 17% in the 3-10 and 10-25 cm intervals. The declining trend continued over the 3 year crop-fallow cycle with losses (depth 0-100 cm) of 29±7.6 t organic C ha-1, 2.0±1.1 t total N ha-1, and 0.7 ± 0.8 t extractable K ha-1. At the end of the fallow period the above ground biomass contained 100 kg N ha-1, 5 kg P ha-1, and 140 kg K ha-1. The fallow vegetation was dominated by Chromolaena odorata with a gradual succession towards tree and bamboo species. The nutrients in the above ground fallow vegetation represent only a small fraction of the N and C lost due to mineralization and leaching. With the present no-till system, mineralization losses are far more serious than losses due to soil erosion. Short fallows will result in a fast decline and low equilibrium of soil organic C levels, reducing the potential for rice yields and limiting farmers choice for other land use options which may become available with better market access.},

abstract={Sediment enrichment and transport from a highly weathered, well-aggregated, and uniformly textured soil were determined using field rainfall simulation. Overland flow on an agriculturally-managed ridge-and-furrow system was generated by applying four successive rainfall events: a dry run on bare soil with a rainfall intensity of 35 mm h-1, a wet run on bare soil with the same rainfall intensity, a very wet run on bare soil with a rainfall intensity of 62 mm h-1, and a final run on partially plastic-mulched soil (to simulate pineapple culture) with a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h-1. Stream power and shear stress of overland flow during the dry and wet runs did not exceed the critical level for rill flow detachment, and resulted in runoff sediment concentrations between 1.7-3.5 g L-1, with 70-90% of sediment consisting of fine aggregates (&lt; 0.063 mm). As flow rate and flow stream power and shear stress increased, sediment concentration increased to over 12 g L-1 for the subsequent two runs. Elevated sediment concentration was associated with increased transport of sand-sized aggregates. Elimination of interrill erosion by plastic mulching reduced transport of fine aggregates in comparison with the bare soil. Due to the high clay content and uniform texture of the Oxisol, sediment from the four events displayed similar primary particle size distribution and no enrichment of clay particles. However, organic carbon (OC) and extractable phosphorus (Ext-P) were enriched in sediment. The magnitudes of enrichment ratio followed the order: dry run (1.2 for OC and 1.4 for Ext-P) &gt; wet run (1.1 for OC and 1.2 for Ext-P) &gt; very wet run (1.03 for OC and 1.1 for Ext-P) &gt; plastic mulch run (close to 1 for both OC and Ext-P). This enrichment was associated with selective transport of fine aggregates which were chemically richer than the coarser ones.},

abstract={Erosion-productivity experiments were conducted in the Kilimanjaro, Tanga, and Morogoro ecoregions for seven predominant soils of these areas. Decrease in topsoil thickness adversely affected a number of soil properties and reduced maize grain yield. Among the most important effects were diminution of soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, total soil N (TSN), available P, available water capacity (AWC), and water saturation percentage. The magnitude of effects differed between soils and ecoregions. Maize grain yield was positively and significantly correlated with topsoil thickness, SOC, total N, CEC, and AWC. Maize grain yield declined at the rate of 38.5, 55.0 and 87.7 kg per cm decrease in topsoil thickness in the Kilimanjaro, Tanga and Morogoro ecoregions, respectively. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The soil under intensive cultivation and low addition of crop residues is exposed to erosion and reduction of organic matter. Increases in soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and nutrient availability may occur in no-till systems with legumes and with large additions of organic residues. Nevertheless, some legumes may increase soil acidification through the carbon and nitrogen cycles. An experiment was carried out over 10 years, with 10 cropping systems on a Dark Red Podzolic soil (Paleudult) to evaluate the effect of no-till cropping systems on soil chemical characteristics. Legume cropping systems resulted in the greatest soil organic C gain and the highest ECEC to a depth of 17.5 cm. The increase was greatest at 0 - 2.5 cm layer. Clover systems resulted in the highest soil acidification at 2.5 - 7.5 and 7.5 - 17,5 cm depths. The rate of soil pH decrease at 2,5 - 7.5 cm depth under clover+ Spergula/maize system was 0.1 unit year-1. Differences in soil acidification affected soil ECEC. Soil exchangeable cation data indicate that nitrate leaching increased soil acidification. Maize yields were greatest in legume systems due to increased N supply.},

abstract={The removal of vegetation is the main cause of soil degradation in semiarid areas. We hypothesized that the changes in soil properties induced by vegetation removal modified the runoff and soil erosion response in a semiarid area of Spain. To test this, two plots (15 by 5 m) were installed on a 23% slope on a Lithic Haploxeroll. Vegetation was removed by clipping from one of the plots (Plot D) and the changes in surface runoff and soil loss were compared with an undisturbed control plot (Plot N) from 1989 to 1993. Total runoff was significantly greater in Plot D (48.8 mm) than in Plot N (34.9 mm). Runoff ratios between the disturbed and natural plots increased with time from 1.4:1 in 1990 to 2.5:1 in 1993. Vegetation removal increased the soil losses in Plot D (150.2 g m-2) by 127% compared with those in Plot N (66.3 g m-2). The annual soil loss ratio between the disturbed and natural plots increased from 1.6:1 in 1989 to 4.2:1 in 1993. The observed increase in surface runoff and soil loss was attributed to a progressive deterioration of soil physical properties in Plot D. Bulk density increased by 8.4% (from 1.55 to 1.68 Mg m-3) and a reduction of total organic carbon (from 4.0 to 2.6%) and the percentage of stable aggregates (from 81.6 to 56.3%) were observed. There was no evidence of vegetation recovery, suggesting that reduced vegetal cover might lead to irreversible soil degradation in semiarid areas.},

abstract={Soils from many portions of the Mediterranean region are subjected to progressive degradation as a result of erosion by wind and water. As a consequence, the fertility level of these degraded soils is declining. This report studied the dehydrogenase activity of 18 soils, all of which were subjected to processes of erosion, in order to ascertain whether such activity could serve as a marker of the microbial activity of a degraded soil. The dehydrogenase activity of the soils studied was not correlated with their organic matter content, indicating that total organic matter was not representative of the microbial activity of degraded soil. An analysis of principal components showed a similar behavior between other indices of microbial activity (basal respiration and biomass carbon) and the dehydrogenase activity values. This data confirmed that dehydrogenase activity can be used as a sensitive marker of soil degradation and soil microbial activity.},

abstract={A brunisolic soil collected from an erosive forest land (HF-1-1) and a yellow soil from an accumulative shallow basin (HF-6-1) in the watershed of Lake Hongfeng (HF) were used for activity measurements of 7Be, 137Cs, 226Ra and 228Ra in different geochemical speciation. More than 85% of 7Be, 137Cs, 226Ra and 228Ra in the soils were bound to organic, Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxide and residual fractions. They could move with soil particles and be used as tracers for the erosion and/or accumulation of soil particles. 7Be geochemical speciation in the soils agreed with its trace for seasonal particle transport. 137Cs geochemical speciation was suitable for tracing soil particle accumulation and for sediment dating. 226Ra and 228Ra were combined in crystalline skeleton of clay minerals and mainly remained as residues in the soils and little was bound to the soluble, exchangeable and carbonate fractions. The differentiation of 226Ra/228Ra activity ratios in different geochemical fractions in the soils could be used as a parameter to trace accumulation and /or erosion of soil particles. © 1997 SCIENCE PRESS,.},

abstract={Experiments to investigate the enrichment mechanisms of organic carbon, nitrogen, and fine particles in eroded sediment were carried out on 2 contrasting soils under simulated rainfall with and without runon. Sediment samples for concentration measurement were collected at different sampling intervals and fractionated into various size fractions using sets of sieves. The fractionated sediment samples and original (uneroded samples) were analysed for total nitrogen and organic carbon to obtain the enrichment ratio (E(R)) for both elements. For both soils, sediment concentration, total nitrogen and organic carbon (E(R)), and concentration ratios of nitrogen and organic carbon changed considerably under the different dominant erosion mechanisms in the experiments. For experiments on both 0·1 and 3% slopes, sediment concentrations of the smaller fractions (<53 and 53-500 μm) were higher than these of the original soil and remained so throughout the duration of the experiment. At the higher slope (3%) and thus lower water depths, a process described as raindrop peeling apparently was more pronounced, since stable soft aggregates were exposed to raindrop impact. The concentration of the smaller size fraction increases with time resulting in an increase in total nitrogen and organic carbon relative to the original soil. This leads to an E(R) greater than unity in the eroded sediment. Rilling was observed in experiments with both rainfall and runon. During the relatively short period prior to the establishment of active rilling, the proportion of larger aggregates increased with time. After this proportion had stabilised, the concentrations of total nitrogen and organic carbon were similar to those in the original soil. Thus, E(R) was close to unity, sometimes being slightly below unity. The presence of significant depths of water greatly influenced both the breakdown of soil aggregates and the size or settling velocity distribution of the eroded sediment. In these circumstances, the size-selected process of deposition can lead to enrichment. With a negligible depth of water on the soil surface, raindrop peeling was the dominant mechanism, producing fine particles richer in organic carbon and total nitrogen than the original soil. As depth of water increases, the effect of the highly varied settling velocity particles on the size characteristics of eroded sediment becomes more evident, and the effect of raindrop stripping diminishes. With a thin layer of water on its surface, both of these mechanisms seem to be operative.},

abstract={Factors and processes influencing carbonate chemistry were constrained in a relict grassland community and recent mesquite dunes using 14C dates and δ13C data of soil organic matter (SOM). Total-profile carbonate contents ranged from 39 to 451 kg m-2 due to local patterns of soil water infiltration and erosion. Carbonate isotopes did not record mid-Holocene climate and vegetation changes, which were inferred from δ13C values of coexisting SOM. Shrub expansion during the past century was recorded by changes in the δ13C values of disseminated carbonate and SOM from mesquite dunes. The disseminated carbonate can provide an environmental signal in polygenetic soils, when pedogenic contributions to isotopic variability are constrained.
We evaluated the extent to which δ13C and δ15O values of disseminated carbonate preserve a signal of Holocene and modern vegetation changes in polygenetic soils of the Jornada Basin, New Mexico. Factors and processes influencing carbonate chemistry were constrained in a relict grassland community and recent mesquite [Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana (L. Benson) M. Johnston] dunes, using 14C dates and δ13C data of soil organic matter (SOM) as independent measures of site history. Total-profile carbonate contents ranged from 39 to 451 kg m-2 due to local patterns of soil water infiltration and erosion. In grassland soils, 14C ages and δ13C values of disseminated carbonate in A and B horizons were influenced by the presence of older detrital carbonate, reworked from surrounding surfaces. As a result, carbonate isotopes did not record mid-Holocene climate and vegetation changes, which were inferred from δ13C values of coexisting SOM. Shrub expansion during the past century was recorded by changes in the δ13C values of disseminated carbonate and SOM from mesquite dunes. Carbon-14 data and mass balance estimates indicated that at least 80% of the dune carbonate (in C horizons) has been isotopically altered by dissolution and recrystallization processes in &lt;100 yr. The modern carbonate is apparently forming from soil waters composed of nearly equal amounts of summer and winter rainfall, as evidenced by carbonate δ18O values. Our analyses indicate that disseminated carbonate can provide a meaningful environmental signal in polygenetic soils, when pedogenic contributions to isotopic variability are constrained.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of rainfall intensity and soil texture on the transport behavior of three pesticides (2,4-D, metolachlor, and chlorpyrifos). We compared water, sediment, and pesticide losses from two soils (Greenville sandy clay loam from Georgia, USA, and a silt loam from Austria), and for two simulated rainfall intensities (40 and 60 mm.h-1) under laboratory conditions. Pesticides were applied to air dry soils at rates of 1.0, 2.0, and 1.5 kg.ha-1 for 2,4-D, metolachlor and chlorpyrifos, respectively. One day after pesticide application, erosion pan was placed at a 7.5% slope and rainfall was simulated. Runoff, wash, splash, and infiltration were measured at 5 min intervals throughout the rainfall event. Pesticide concentrations were determined in selected runoff, splash water and infiltration samples, and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Depending on soil texture, time until steady-state runoff was reached varied. Higher silt content of Pyhra soil led to surface sealing, increased runoff, and high splash water rates. Interrill erosion from Pyhra soil was high for air dry surface and decreased when soil surface was sealed or crusted. 2,4-D losses by runoff were higher for Greenville soil with lower organic carbon and lower susceptibility to raindrop detachment. Metolachlor and 2,4-D showed similar transport behaviour. Transport of chlorpyrifos was small.},

abstract={Irrigation-induced erosion and land leveling have decreased crop yields on approximately 800 000 ha of south-central Idaho silt loam soils. Previous attempts to increase subsoil productivity to that of the topsoil have not been successful on these soils. This study was conducted to find a method(s) for increasing the productivity of freshly exposed subsoil to that of the topsoil and to determine the factor(s) limiting subsoil production. A 4-yr study was initiated by removing the surface 0.3 m of topsoil from strips between undisturbed topsoil strips of a Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Durixerollic Calciorthid). Different crop rotations were established within the strips and fertility treatments were applied across the strips. The fertilizer treatments were conventional fertilizer application according to soil test, dairy manure, and two cottage cheese (acid) whey rates. During the fourth year, dry edible bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv. Viva) were grown on the entire plot area as a test crop. The application of 44 Mg manure ha-1 in the spring and 93 Mg manure ha-1 in the fall of 1991 (first year of study) was the only treatment that restored subsoil bean production to that of the topsoil plots. Plant Zn and soil organic C concentrations were the only measured factors that correlated with bean yield increases on the subsoil.},

abstract={Because of erosion problems, an effort has been undertaken to evaluate the effect of tillage intensity on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling on a vertisol. Soil samples at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth were collected from a split plot experiment with five different levels of tillage intensity on Houston Black soil (fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellusterts). The experiment was a split plot design with 5 replications. The main plots were chisel tillage, reduced tillage, row tillage, strip tillage, and no tillage. The subplots were soil fertility levels with either high or low fertilizer application rate. Total N, total phosphorus (P), organic C, inorganic N, and C:N ratio were measured on soil samples as well as the potential C mineralization, N mineralization, C turnover, and C:N mineralization ratio during a 30 d incubation. Total P and organic C in soil were increased, with 0.9 and 0.8 kg P ha-1 and 20.6 and 20.0 kg C ha-1, for high and low soil fertility, respectively. Fertilizer application had no effect on either total N at the 0-10 cm depth, or on soil nutrient status below 10 cm. Potential soil N mineralization was decreased at the 0-10 cm depth and increased at the 20-30 cm depth by the high fertilizer treatment. Chisel tillage decreased total N and P in the 0-10 cm depth, with 1.4 and 1.6 kg N ha -1 amd 0.8 and 0.9 kg ha-1. However, chisel tillage increased total N and P at the 10-20 cm depth, with 1.3 and 1.2 kg N ha-1, and 0.72 and 0.66 kg P ha-1 for chisel tillage and no tillage respectively. Tillage intensity increased C mineralization and C turnover, but reduced N mineralization at the 0-10 cm depth. The results indicate that intensity tilled soil has a greater capacity for C mineralization and for reductions in soil organic C levels compared to less intensively tilled systems.},

abstract={The sources and burial processes of organic matter in marine sediments are not well understood, yet they are important if we are to have a better understanding of the global carbon cycle. In particular, the nature and fraction of the terrestrial organic carbon preserved in marine sediments is poorly constrained. Here we use the chemical and stable carbon isotope signatures of oxidation products from a macromolecular component (lignin) of the terrigenous organic matter preserved in offshore surface sediments in the Gulf of Mexico to complement similar data from an existing onshore transect in this region. The complete onshore-offshore data set, along with radiocarbon dates of the bulk organic material at the same sites, allows the differentiation of material originating from plants that photosynthesize using the C4 mechanism from those that undergo C3 photosynthesis. We conclude that the offshore lignins derive from erosion of the extensive grassland (C4) soils of the Mississippi River drainage basin, and that the nearshore lignins originate largely from C3 plant detritus from coastal forests and swamps. This distribution is probably due to the hydrodynamic sorting of the different source materials during their seaward transport. These results suggest that previous studies have significantly underestimated the terrigenous fraction of organic matter in offshore sediments by not recognizing the contribution of C4 vegetation to tile carbon-isotope composition. Such an under-estimate may force revisions in the assessment of past marine primary productivity and associated organic carbon fluxes, and of organic matter preservation/remineralization and nutrient cycling in marine sediments.},

abstract={Lake sediments provide an integrated record of the sediment yields and sources in the contributing basin. In the research area on the prairies of western Canada, the earliest sediments deposited in the larger lakes predate European settlement, allowing direct evaluation of basin response to settlement. Lake sediment cores were collected from an unnamed lake in the Stony Creek drainage basin in the aspen parkland region of eastern Saskatchewan. Pre- and post-settlement sediments in a central core were separated on the basis of an increase in Populus pollen associated with the southward advance of the aspen parkland ecotone caused by fire suppression following settlement. A wet chemical extraction procedure was used to separate the operationally defined organic fraction, the acid-soluble authigenic fraction, and biogenic silica from the clastic, non-carbonate, allogenic fraction of the lake sediment. Changes in the mineralogy and geochemistry of the clastic, allogenic fraction indicate that settlement resulted in an increased contribution of topsoil to the sediment load of Stony Creek. Elemental ratios, however, show that topsoil did contribute to the allogenic lake sediment fraction prior to settlement. Post-settlement changes in deposition rates of the allogenic fraction resulted from changes in land use rather than from climatic variability. Allogenic deposition rates reached a maximum in the 1950s and 1960s owing to an increase in the area under field crops and the increased use of high-powered agricultural machinery. Allogenic deposition rates decreased in more recent years because of a more extensive application of soil conservation measures. Post-settlement changes in deposition rates of individual elements within the allogenic fraction indicate that various sediment sources respond differently to changes in land use. Over the most recent 100 years, since the onset of European settlement, the erosional response of the basin appears to be controlled by land use changes rather than by climatic variability. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
